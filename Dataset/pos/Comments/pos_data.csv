"In older editions of DnD, this was expected an valid

A) you literally received exp equal to gold spent. This was meant to do two things - give adventurers an insentive to overcome traps and monsters, and show to the DM how strong characters were. Back then, levels meant a minimal amount. Having 1500 for plate mail was a better indicator of character power.

B) monsters were way deadlier and PCs way squishier. If you tried to fight everything in the dungeon in a Gary Gygax design, you'd party wipe by the third room. Old school DnD was about more than fighting - it was about tricking, circumventing, pacifying, negotiating and bribing away threats.

I wouldn't begrudge gold used to that effect.

Only awarding exp for violence was 3.0s.biggest mistake and lead to the MurderHobo epidemic.

If you want them to solve problems creatively, reward bribery with exp. It expended their resources (gold/loot) and it solved a problem. It's just as valid as.combat."

King Trump sounds like some failed spin-off character in the Mario universe. He also sounds really slow and would be an unpopular choice in Super Smash Bros.
But did you see a commentator on a certain news Network that claimed Trump is more powerful than any king therefore this ruling doesn't apply? Guh... Can't believe the times we live in... It's not like the colonies United for any specific kingly reason... Oh... Wait...
"And with one ruling, a thousand Thanksgiving dinners just exploded into family warfare"
Obviously all the Jesters employed by Trump made no impression on the judge.
The fact this needed to be explained to top officials is incomprehensible.
"Is that lawyerese for ""quit yer bullshit""?"
Brit here with a stupid question but how many judges have a say about what Prez Donnie J does? I see so many stories from the US where it feats a judge saying this or denying that when it comes to Trump and almost nothing seems to really have an impact on his presidency or decisions.

">Jackson's 120-page ruling offers a brutal takedown of the White House's beloved “absolute immunity” defense, which the judge describes as “baseless,” “a fiction that has been fastidiously maintained over time through the force of sheer repetition,” and as an idea that “simply has no basis in the law.” 

It took *120 pages* to make this clear.  How much do you want to bet that the Republicans will *still* argue that the judge is wrong?"

Checks and Balance's are starting to get very annoyed that have been ignored all this time.
Why did it take so long?
What does this amount to? We all knew this was the case. Does this mean WH and state department has to turn over documents to the IC now? Or is it just yet more empty air?
But many presidents act as if they are kings and emperors.
"Finally, a huge helping of clarity and common sense. Why did it take so long?"

"Well shit... a Federal Judge says so... It isn't like the Judiciary hasn't been stepping clear out of its bounds toward injunctions toward the President of the United States. Legislation from the bench has gone on way too far.

I gotta quick lesson for said judge. The President has qualified immunity that can only be broken by impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate. This extends to not only actions but decisions made by the president, e.g. forbidding someone from testifying. 

Take that one up with the Supreme Court, slappy.

Crack that egg in the Senate, bitches."
My question is at what point is this criminal behaviour held accountable? Seems like the oompa loompa is going to get out without any real consequences regardless of what law he breaks. The point of unacceptable behaviour was crossed even before he was elected and somehow he manages to dig deeper to whatever rock bottom bar he previously set.
"Absolutely. 
Unfortunately it appears we are nearing a point when a measured understanding of the constitution and the purpose of checks and balances evades the power that is checked and balanced. 

These people will not give up power even when defeated.  If a transition does happen, the process will be unprecedented. A terrifying thought."
"NO GODS 

NO MASTERS"
So what about the pseudo-aristocracy that are the billionaires?
"Yes. But thinking about this on a global scale where other countries do have kings, trump is no king. He is an absolute scoundrel that loves power. 

I rather think of him like Joffrey from Game of Thrones."
"What baffles me is that the constitution literally says that the president shall be removed from office on conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. *On conviction.* Clearly the intention for them to be held within the limitations of law is there, it literally says that there is a consequence of them being convicted. If the intention was for them to not be able to be charged while sitting, it wouldn't say there should be a consequence of them having been successfully done so.

What I also find kind of funny is that many of our institutions were modeled after the Roman republic. Well, in Rome, certain civil officials were immune from prosecution while they were acting in that capacity (however, all charges could/would be levied upon them as soon as they left office), which kind of parallels this absurd assertion that the president can't be charged with a crime.

Well, basically how the entire republic ended and turned into a dictatorial empire involved Julius Caesar abusing this mechanism by moving from one protected office to another, all the while widely abusing his positions of power for personal gain. Eventually the senate tried to demand that Caesar disband his army and return to Rome (so he could be prosecuted for all of the insanely illegal things he had done) leading to this great and terrible civil war which ended up with him winning and becoming pretty much the de facto leader of Rome until his death.

It just seems so painfully ironic to me that given how the Roman republic served as such an obvious model for much of our country's foundation, that there would be people attempting to import this function that directly led to the transition from the republic as a ruling body to a dictatorship."
IMHO The point of them making this ridiculous argument is not that they think they can win it is to use the courts to delay and obstruct the investigation. Will an appeal be coming next? If the past is any example yes.
"He’s not a king. He’s nowhere near a king. He has zero power except EO’s. They will be undone in week. The real issue is the corrupt Republican Senate and DOJ protecting him and being outright criminal and they have zero fear of personal repercussions. 

He wishes he could be king. He also has no idea how to govern so he’s done nothing expect his tax break for the rich. While the big problems are McConnell working behind the scenes on judges etc."
Better tell Bill Barr and the GOP lol
So now will the democrats finally take one from the Republican cookbook and from now on always refer to Emperor Trump?
"This is a gross, naïve oversimplification and a massive historical inaccuracy, and an extremely irresponsible statement to make for the sake of cheap political commentary. First off, the British monarchy was a shell of its former self by the 1770s, and Parliament held all the cards by that point anyway, since absolutism in Britain was effectively dead by 1689. Secondly, the American Revolution officially was fought over colonial representation in Parliament—the monarchy was a spectator, so much so that George III had to ask Parliament with hat in hand to authorize sending soldiers overseas. Realistically, a handful of wealthy landowners (a hefty number of them are counted among the Founding Fathers) didn’t like that the British were clamping down on smuggling and aggressive land speculation, both of which had their practitioners among many of the founders, and decided to get proactive. The fact that many of the colonial states initially refused to have anything to do with a bunch of Massachusetts firebrands says a *lot* that’s sadly ignored. Thirdly, it’s far easier to get rid of a bad monarch than a bad president. The American impeachment system is slow and ineffective, requiring more backroom deals than legal processes, which just exacerbates and compounds political shenanigans. It’s a giant chess game, and in the end, average Americans always lose."
"Well, it formed a long time ago.

I guess its changing now."
I read somewhere the king who put this rule in place was voted against unanimously by the people because he was such a good King.
"It seems like it has always been technically possible to act this way but only now as the goalposts have been moved far enough it is actually practically possible to get away with it.

The rules were designed thinking that the voters would actually elect presidents who have at least some decency and morals. Even Nixon had resigned by now as he lost support. 

But nobody has really tried to just not give a shit about the rules like this president. He took it to a new level. 

He is like the kid that just completely ignores the rules while playing by saying ""nuh uh"". What can the other kids realistically do to that if there is no adult in the room? The democrats can't just stop playing and leave. Adam Schiff can't just hit the president because he is being a ""doo doo head""."
"In reality, it is a core tenet of this Nation’s founding that the powers of a monarch must be split between the branches of the government to prevent tyranny,” Jackson writes."
That must be why Trump can wear orange-face yet Trudeau can't wear blackface.
"Because congress keeps ceding more and more of its authority to the president.  I know many of them predicted the deleterious effects of political parties, but it doesn't seem like they even conceived of the idea of one branch of government willingly prostrating itself to another and handing over all of its power."
"Not true, the Canadian pm has the powers of PM, the monarch, and the party whip(parties must vote as a block or get tossed from caucus)

Imagine if trump had the power to force Congress into an election when the polls favoured republicans. Prime Ministers can do that, infact, it happens every time a majority isn't won in Parliament(power of the monarch technicaly but in reality the pm just ask an the queens representative can't say no). On top of that our senate is by appointment till 75 years of age (again, not really a PM's power but afaik trudeau was the first one to delegate that to a committee). Oh and also, because of party whips and the fact that party heads choose the direction of their caucus, the pm can basicaly singlehandedly drive parliament.

The title doesn't seem as fancy, but rest assured, the PM has some crazy power"
Trumparoo Banzai and the Laws of the Eighth Dimension.
"Oh, I believe it.  These cult followers believe ""Alternative facts"" are a real thing."
The very best alternate law.
"If you look up the Nixon Frost interview that's essentially the theory.

 In their swearing in oath it says to 'defend and protect the constutuion' and that the Constitution vests executive authority in the president to do that. Constutuional law then questions if that leaves it so open that the president can do anything as long as he says he did it to protect the Constitution. This is in part why it comes down to who owns the house and senate majorities. You can impeach or not impeach a president for pretty much any reason as long as you secure a majority in both. Constutuional Law be weird like that."
"These laws are the grimoire that has kept this witch hunt alive!
(Had to look up grimoire)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire"
"Because, despite all, we are a nation of laws and as absurd as the WH defense was, it was brought up in a legal process, and only a judge had the authority to uphold it, or call BS on it. Who else would be able to? 
Ultimately, anyone has every right to attempt a Chewbacca Defense, the lawyers will present it 
- the judge is the person who will asses the validity of it."
"IMO, the fundamental problem with the US Constitution is that the founding father's wrote it with men of honor and decency in mind.  They couldn't conceive of the obscenity known as the modern GOP."
The US really isn't that great. It's pretty overhyped.
"What you are suggesting is literally impossible. Not trying to have any kind of tone with that just saying it academically and factually, the constitution is left with ambiguity because nobody will ever have perfect foresight. You said it yourself in your comment, ""the US Constitution is this great *framework""*

Also, just play it out in your head. Maybe something seems perfectly clear in the Constitution, but what happens when you point to it and the guilty parties who wish to surpass it say ""no it doesn't.""

You need people who have in-depth understanding of the Constitution to interpret how it applies in a very particular case and to make a judgment ruling on it, hence the Supreme Court...which is also laid out in the Constitution. So even the Constitution itself doesn't see this as an issue you as you are suggesting it is."
Because it’s incredibly easy to slow things down with lawyers involved.
"And the WH is planning to appeal, so.."
I think by now many people have realized that the check and balances the US has must be reworked as soon as possible. They're currently good looking but about as effective as the checks and balances of a corrupt third world country.

Trump has already established that it's perfectly acceptable to fabricate a national emergency to bypass congress on budgetary allocations for pet projects.  If Trump is allowed to divert funding to build his wall against Congress's explicit wishes, what's to stop say, Warren for example, from claiming that universal health care is a national emergency and divert funding into that?  Or claiming that the student debt crisis is a national emergency, and divert funding into paying off student debt?

Sure, the Democrats aren't as likely to slip over into excess and abuse, but Trump has now established that the President can force through whatever he wants by doing an end-run around Congress, so if a Democratic POTUS gets elected without the support of both the House and Senate, they can whip that out and force through whatever they campaigned on.  I don't think Republicans have quite realized that, or else they're so convinced that their election fraud and voter suppression will preclude the possibility of a Democrat ever winning the election again, that it's unnecessary to be concerned about it."
"What these Republicans also don't realise is that they are setting the precedent for the next Democrat leader to also do the same. If Trump gets away with this, I wonder how they will react when the next black US president uses the office and his standing with international leaders to further his own political and personal interests."
"We laughed at W because he seemed kinda ignorant. 

But no one ever ever ever ever questioned his loyalty to the Constitution or to America. 

Trump's a different story there.  Fucking traitor."
History will remember W as little more than a useful idiot. I think it's common knowledge now that Cheney and a few choice others in the Republican party were the bad actors in that admin.
"Trump is a test of the American idea. 

If America fails to deal with it and corse correct to prevent future infections, then it’s immune system has failed and the parasite of autocratic oligarchy(modern royalty/serfdom dynamic) has won."
You mean aside from lying to get the US into two wars where countless atrocities were committed?
"Bloomberg just made it official he's running for 'power', too, and I'm only thinking it's because Trump was so successful at it. Out of touch billionaires are all vying for the throne now. I mean, hey... America is built off capitalism now anyways.... smh"
The fucking orange monkey with a wig has been president for 3 years now. *We* are the monkeys who have allowed it to happen. For 3 years now every fucking headline is about someone destroying Trump or starting an investigation or arresting one of his aids but the fucking orange monkey with a wig is still having a blast playing golf and getting filthy rich. These headlines are nothing but a circlejerk.
"Crazy how the majority of Republicans will probably still vote for him. GOP, how far you have fallen since Lincoln."
He'd just be a jigglypuff type character that yells instead of singing. Then throws credit cards and summons eldritch horrors to fight for him.
What about Fuhrer Pumpkin instead?
"What network could you ever be talking about? Surely you are not talking about credible, impartial, trustworthy Faux News^(TM)"
"Yeah impeachment is a process the constitution explicitly allows for.

It just further exposes the lie that conservatives care about the constitution when they continue to support Donald ""phony emoluments clause"" Trump."
Jesters spoke truth to power. These sycophants are much closer to The Gimp from Pulp Fiction.
The idea that they don't know what they're doing and actually believe this is the correct take on it is dangerously ridiculous.
"That would be a very good argument strategy honestly. They might not see it that way on it's face, but get them to envision a Democrat president that is just as limitless, and they might start to see the problem."
That's almost what I normally call him anyway... Fucking Trump is the full version.
I hope it doesn't because he's likely to feel it legitimises him as being a king

"""half"" the royalty in Europe?  Either you are unaware of how many (constitutional democratic) monarchies still exist in Europe, or you are greatly overestimating the powers of many of them.  I can't think of a single European monarchy which is not functionally little more than a ceremonial job and a rubber stamp on the decisions of their (democratically elected) governments, let alone *SIX* of them."
"I agree let's form it! I'm thinking we call it the Safety Society, does that sound good? Or just SS for short."
His aides will have to testify or face prosecution like anyone who fails to.
"Pretty sure it was ruled that it should be released, but Trump appealed so a stay was issued (which makes sense)."
Which media?
We're hearing about these revolutions because these countries at some point in their history failed to check the lawless actions of their leaders. If we fail to address the criminality in our country we'll have these revolutions too. So trump gets talked about.
"Yeah let's not talk about the guy with control of the worlds most powerful nuclear arsenal (10× over) who's actively promoting and supporting the world's most horrible dictators while extorting others for political gain and trying to rule the world. I feel like... I feel like there was another similar guy that did similar things that the league of nations ignored.  He had similar rhetoric and malignant narcissism. Called everyone reporting his crimes liars... Idk, can't quite put my finger on it.

Even if you aren't American, you should be worried about this guy, and especially so as he's about to lose power and face prison. He'll do literally anything to save his own ass. This guy is a monster."
"Yes, honestly: very tired. That's why I need to hear it even more."
"While true, you also have to consider the fact that he is the leader of one of the most influential countries in the world, and his choices can have very damaging effects on the rest of the world, such as abandoning the Kurds."
"You know the great thing about Reddit is that you can choose to not read stories that don't interest you.  In fact, there's an option which will allow you to filter out all Trump-related news completely, so it'd be like no one was talking about him at all."
"Because this is r/news version 2.0.

It used to be that this sub would at least make up excuses for why US internal news was deemed relevant for this sub, like ""*Well, the article mentions another country in the seventh paragraph, so it's world news!*"".

But, it looks like this sub has since gone from ""*news from around the world except US-internal news / US politics*"" to ""*global news, including US-internal news / US politics, which, due to the large amount of US citizens of Reddit, will always get a ton of upvotes*"".

It's the curse of any sub that reaches critical mass; at some point, what makes a sub distinct gets blurry due to your everyday Joe upvoting whatever he feels is interesting, with little care for what the sub is meant for. It's why posts on r/funny aren't funny, posts on r/creepy aren't creepy, and now why posts on r/worldnews aren't world news."
This isn’t legislation from the bench. It’s interpretation of the law. But I’m sure he’ll appreciation the lesson from the anonymous Trumpsucker on an Internet forum who is just repeating what he read some smarter Trumpsucker say on the internet
"The People have voted in a Senate that won't hold him accountable.  The People have hence chosen to support criminality in their democracy.  Democracy has no inherent defense to this, it requires good faith participation to exist.  Whether The People are being misled by powerful/financial/media/religious/political interests is a different question about whether democracy can function in a capitalist system which allows wealth/power to concentrate in a way that determines persuasion and undermines education."
"Hes not being held accountable because the two party system has resulted in one party having way too much power. A single party was never meant to be able to withhold bills nor stonewall while claiming immunity like this. At this point it seems the only way anyone will be held accountable is if some republicans flip, which seems unlikely. Most likely outcome would be nothing happening until after Trump is no longer president and state courts are able to prosecute as the GOP won't be able to protect each other at the state level."
"Bush Cheney created dark sites where they literally tortured people and lied us into two wars killing over one million people; now their kids are into media and politics, and G.W. goes to baseball games with Ellen."

"You know, while I didn't vote for him, I tried to give him a chance. When he first got in, he kept getting shat on, and I told everyone I saw, to wait. Judge how he handles being a president I said.

I gave this guy enough of a fair chance. I tried to have hope he'd be good, but that fell apart 6 or 7 months ago, maybe longer.

I hope he gets jail time for this crap"
We need James Cameron to raise the bar.
"I wonder what happens if his Douche decides that no elections are necessary because he decided he is not finished yet and all his current aides in the government just comply.

Give these oompa loompas a clean coal powered electric chair. It's the only thing that will get the message across to these crime lords.
"I don't see how the courts can claim he doesn't have absolute immunity.

There are 3 branches.

The executive is him.

The Judicial punishments can be waived by him.

The legislative can do anything provided it has two third majority.

Yet it feels like the legislative branch has no actual drive to charge him.

I don't see anything happening during his office however I can imagine him getting reamed once out of office."
"I mean same thing could of been said for clinton(bill) when he was impeached he was found not guilty even with evidence provided, same will be with trump because factionalism will never allow the other side to have a victory even at the expense of justice."
Just getting him out of office will be big enough.

Prime Ministers can do that, infact, it happens every time a majority isn't won in Parliament(power of the monarch technicaly but in reality the pm just ask an the queens representative can't say no)

Yeah after the Civil War we didn't elect a president from a Confederate state until LBJ and that's what I'd like to see us do to the GOP after this level of treason.
The even scarier thing is that Trump has appointed ~200 of these Ferderal judges. What if this ruling was by one of them?
"The real problem is that they care about the country, they're just bugfuck insane about what they think should be done with it. 

The Nazis or most of them were no doubt largely sincerly pro-Germany and thought they were doing the right thing while they were gassing and burning their fellow human beings. 

Similarly, the people in the ""heartland"" are crazed idiots, but they're sincere crazed idiots, which is worse. 

The political leadership no doubt also has true believers, who think they're doing the right thing by pissing all over Democracy, like that utter scumfilth McConnell."
"And even scarier than that, it will probably be someone competent who was able to learn and observe Trump's failures so they will not make the same. Even if dems win the next election, any progress made will again be reversed by the right's agenda. It's just a constant back and forth at this point. I don't see stability coming any time soon. His supporters aren't going away - they'll just go quiet again for a little while until the next wannabe dictator emerges.

Yes but he couldn't force one. Our PM has very little power alone and needs the backing of parliament to do most things fortunately.
"The UK PM has a lot less power, with a much stronger parliament and a party that drives the party leader and pm and not the other way around."
"While you are technicaly correct, it's just like what I was saying, a PM may not officially hold all power they effectually do, at least in Canada, Australia, the UK (though i think they have a bit more of a check), and most likely New Zealand. Japan has a seperate head of state, India has a seperate head of state, and so does Italy. Canada has the Queen who has no power by convention (but legally holds executive authority) and hands that power to the Governor general (same position as the Queen), who does what the PM says to avoid a second ""King-Byng affair"". That and party whips in Canada are much stronger than in the US, that effectually turns the pm into the party."
I swear to god we could start spreading this as a joke and we'd end up being responsible for the end of the world.

*New England has entered the chat...*
"I know you weren't being literal, I was just pointing out that Trump acts more like a king than pretty much literally *all* the royalty in Europe, but that's not much of a stretch because pretty much no monarch in Europe acts much like a monarch.  Queen Elizabeth is probably one of the most prominent, and while she *technically* has a massive amount of power (effectively complete control over the UK), she doesn't utilize that power beyond her duties to Parliament in order to ensure the Government keeps functioning.

Trump, on the other hand, appears to openly believe that he is above the law, despite the law clearly and unequivocally stating that he is 100% absolutely not, just that the law is applied differently to him than to others (hence why he must be impeached and removed before he can be indicted for criminal offenses).

>And fwiw, I come from a country with a monarch.

FWIW, I do too, just not a European one. :)"
You know you can filter out discussions on Trump? Look over to the right of your screen when on this sub.
No.  We’re not tired of hearing about this guy ruining our country as a traitor.  This is very important and if you can’t be “bothered”. Just bunker down in your moms basement and wait for half-life.
"The economy was on the rise under Obama. You show me one solid, indisputable Trump-implemented policy that has led to our current financial state and I'll admit, right here, for the first time ever, that Trump has had a positive impact on the U.S."
"The stock market has been vastly outpacing the GDP, which means that the Fed isn't doing their job. We are currently in a bubble, and the probability is high that Trump is using his influence to line to pockets of *actual* rich people by tweeting about trade relations."
His worst nightmare = his financial status displayed for all the world to laugh at.
Not true. He has committed crimes in the state of New York.  Only the governor of New York can pardon them.
He can't be re-elected forever
He won't get shit thrown at him during his current presidency because the process to impeach him will take longer then him being in office... Now if he gets another run then the process wi finish in the 1st run of it or at worst the middle of the 2nd.
That's just 2(b).
Outcome #4 He's the oldest president to run in office and will likely die before any jail time.
"This outcome would make me happy, sadly"
And threatens to fling poo at anybody who tries to enter!
"My theory has been that he will deny and deflect everything while continuing to commit crimes, until the very last day of his presidency.

Then he'll leave for Russia and not come back, and claim that he's still president and that the new one is illegitimate (lol irony) - and probably ""cAlL fOr ImPeAcHmEnT"" or some other insane shit.

...All this is if he isn't impeached, removed, and jailed before then, though.. or he doesn't die before any of THAT happens...

So I'll bet like 10 bucks ^((again lol)^)"
"He knows nothing. And he still has his Twitter followers which will keep him useful even when out of office.

What, you thought he would stop spreading bullshit once he's out of the White House?"
This angle is not impossible. He is an experienced shirker and liar of course.
"Well conveniently, controversial supreme judge Kavanaugh was appointed precisely *because he wrote an open letter to trump expressing his viewpoint that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted*.

What this essentially means is that as long as the senate doesn’t impeach him, he can do whatever the fuck he wants. Which opens everything up to insanely raised stakes come transition time.

What happens when he refuses to leave/accept the results/actively corrupts the election (more than he did last time). Senate is republican so a decent chance they won’t impeach, and charges can’t be brought against him. Fun how that works right?"
"There's a memo at the Department of Justice that says a sitting President cannot be indicted.  It's the reason Mueller gave for refusing to say explicitly that Trump committed crimes: because he couldn't be indicted, he couldn't defend himself in court.  The idea is that, even if a sitting president had committed a crime, the disruption wrought upon the country were he arrested makes this action unthinkable.  He would need to be impeached and removed before he could be arrested.

This being said (and correct me if I'm wrong reddit), the DOJ is a federal body, and if a state body finds he's broken that state's laws, they could get him that way.  The question is whether any district would deem his actions serious enough to justify the damage his arrest could cause the country.  The way the media describes it, the Southern District of New York could be that district."
"There's some debate about that. Current Justice Department policy is no, he can't. There's no law that says he can't though. But, the Constitution lays out the impeachment process, which most legal experts generally agree is a necessary step before he gets charged with anything, at least at a federal level. 

There's also a whole other level of uncertainty about things like state charges, the statute of limitations, and whatnot. Basically, we're in uncharted waters, and any attempt to push for legal consequences while he's still in office is going to wind up eventually in front of the Supreme Court."
Or we have another case of what happened to Nixon; he leaves office before the term is up and the President Pence pardons him.
Given you hope? How didn’t that destroy it?
But you can't support multiple parties unless you have a reasonable method for voting that wont instantly turn back into the 2 party system.
Neither is what you claim.  They are both oligarch puppets.
"Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, so Ford was able to pardon him.  It's a tricky play, but it is a constitutional one."
There is no such thing as a legitimate king.
Hm... hmmmmmm....
"She's a figure head. We're taking real kings/dictators like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, NK, Russia."
"Oompa-loompa, diddle-di-deam

Like MLK, we too have a dream."
I think you've picked a bad time for this argument - out last few PMs in the UK have routinely been trounced in parliament and court cases have re asserted the pure sovereignty of Parliament
"If we're getting technical the PM has effective control over the powers of the monarch *that pertain to parliament* which are relatively limited, its not as if he has the power of the actual monarch. The party whip is a 2 edged sword, its only effective if the PM is already strong, under a weak PM enforcing the whip is a gamble especially if it might mean losing the support of a PM while governing in minority. It isn't much more than the ability to say ""vote with us or we kick you out of the club"" which seems like the prerogative of that club, after all that is kind of the *point* of a political party. I would argue that process and convention prop up a powerful PM but hamstring a weak PM, probably by design. The UK actually has a much stronger commons than most of their offspring, and therefore a weaker executive, generally speaking."
"Australia runs a mostly independent senate as a check on the power of the lower house (which includes the Prime Minister). Also, Australia's preferential voting gives far more power to minor parties and independents then the First Past The Post system used in the US, UK and Canada.

And that's before we get to our recent history of the party backstabbing 8 of the last 5 prime ministers."
Boo*TAY*! BOO**TAY**!!
The fact that the justice system can be partial to a political stance is ridiculous to me
"Since 1988, the Republicans have won the popular vote for the presidency exactly once. The current iteration of this party is a master class on how to consolidate and maintain power through machinations, procedural manipulation, and stonewalling despite being outnumbered and unpopular.

The optimist in me wants to believe that some important segments of the country (see Texas) are on the verge of California-ization and the complete collapse of that shithole ideology and the current insanity and naked aggression is indicative of that impending destruction, but on my dark days I fear that this country may be on a march to something much, much more sinister."
"Not sure why they were worried, though, Obama turned out to be a perfectly respectable Republican president. 

I mean, people did think they were electing a Democrat, but win some lose some."
Forty Nine. Hawaii will never be a Republican State.
"Most voters in the south were too blind/ignorant to acknowledge or critically think about how much his own hometown hated him.  The right wing in the Midwest and south is precisely why we got Trump the politician in the first place.  And it’s how he has operated his whole life: manipulate those who are too stupid to look into his crimes, misdeeds, and corruption CUZ HES GAWT A TV SHOW AND SHINY HAIR!"
They meant what if one of Trump's (presumably incompetent) judges was given this case to rule on instead of the (presumably competent) judge who came to this decision.
Rightly so
Give him time.
Trump: hold my coke light
His ult is pussy grab
"Haha yeah more or less the point I was going for. Americans have themselves a president who acts like a king, while Europe/the Commonwealth Realms have monarchs who act more like presidents. It’s interesting."
"Well sure it's important but I'd argue two things:

1. Every 5th post is about Trump on this sub. Often restating the same things over and over.

2. This sub is worldnews so it's understandable that some people get irritated when there are multiple articles on one person / country every day for the last 3 years.

I'm not saying this isn't important or big news but it seems to be the major focus on this sub which makes other, arguably bigger stories take a back seat. Not only on this sub but in the media in general."
"https://moneyandmarkets.com/trump-obama-economy-deregulation-tax-cuts/


One of thousands of articles that show what deregulation of previous administration's has done for the economy and businesses.  In the second term under Obama, the company I worked for was struggling to give us 40 hours a week at a rather low wage.  There was nowhere else to go either unless it was fast food or retail for minimum wage.  The company provided parts for large manufacturers such as steel kills, fabrication companies, and even the odd military contract.  Before I left overtime was free for the taking and basically employees were allowed to work as much as they wanted.  We went from a half page of backlog (about 20 orders a week) to fourteen in a matter of weeks in the end of 2016.  Currently, that company has expanded twice and from what my old boss tells me they have nearly twice the employees and have actually upped their starting wages and give alright benefits for a ""lowly foundry"" job.  He was seriously debating shutting down completely in 2015.  Now the company and all their employees are doing a helluva lot better.

I know it's anecdotal, but that's a trend in manufacturing over the past few years.  I moved jobs and over doubled my salary, but also have quite good insurance as well.  I can consider myself ""middle class"" where in 2014 I was never able to pay my rent on time because I had to shovel driveways or mow lawns to break even.  Manufacturing jobs were shit under Obama, and I lived through it.  Almost went homeless, couldn't afford anything nice, and lived off save a lot groceries.  Now, I don't worry near as much and my stress level dropped significantly and can actually go to the doctor if I'm sick or hurt.  Like I said, anecdotal, but that's my viewpoint."
"This. I don't believe he has EVER been a billionaire. I believe his metric for being a ""billionaire"" is owing more than a billion dollars and not paying it back."
Oh I’m sure he’s made out well from his run as president.  Maybe almost out of debt Russians even.
"Unfortunately he's used the office of your president to enrich himself. While not as rich as he says he is, I do believe he is waaaaayyy richer now than before. (see using taxpayer money to play golf at his own course, bringing the whole presidential staff. Or certain scottish golf estates hosting military personnel.)

So he might not mind people seeing his current wealth. (he'll definitely fight tooth and nail to hide the past though)"
Don't really think that will matter much. He will have been president of the United States which is a far greater achievement than being a billionaire.
His tax records will show he's been bailed out with russian money.
He would likely beg to differ.
Are you a penguin?
"We thought the similar thing in Russia.

But it is 2019 and we still have the same president since 2000."
He can try.
His terms can outlast the statute of limitations on the crimes he’s alleged to have committed.
I'm fairly convinced he would die in office if reelected. His health is awful.
But why?
"Don't worry, they're the U. S. SS."
*USSS.
...with extra steps.
He knows nothing that he hasn't already spilled.
"I agree that he will continue to tweet his shit storm of stupid once he is out of office. The question is whether Twitter will have the balls too suspend his account when he breaches their terms (probably within the first ten post presidency tweets) because they can no longer hide behind the excuse ""people need to hear the president."""
That's super fucked up!
I love that dealing with the disruption is more unthinkable than leaving a criminal in the highest office for potentially most of a decade.  Like that won't disrupt anything.
Thanks for the explanation :)
It needs to be done. Our country looks like a joke. He's broken dozens and dozens of laws (including fucking treason) and continues to do so daily. The blatant corruption going on from the WH to congress has gone too far. He needs to be made an example of as well as anyone who's been complicit with him in the dozens of crimes he's committed.
A federal pardon doesn't apply to state laws.
NY state has a laundry list of charges I’m sure
"Ehh, people keep saying he'll resign or whatever, but that absolutely won't happen. Chump is a textbook narcissist, and way too full of himself and proud to step down. To him that would be admitting defeat and/or wrongdoing.

I can count on one hand the number of times in Chump's entire life that he's done that."

The hag in the bog decides by handing out a sword.
Indeed and I am pretty sure that was one of the main points in the show. Always found it weird when fans were discussing the legitimacy of the various characters when all that mattered was which one would win in the end.
Try telling that to the king...
Except some are. They're just not absolute monarchs. Elective or democratic monarchy.
There are plenty of constitutional monarchies with legitimate monarchs. I live in one and when I look around the world at the sort of people who are voted in as presidents I’m rather happy to do so.
Only the one true Morty!
Only one of them has a monarchy. The others are corrupted forms of communist/capitalist countries gone autocratic.

"Yeah, I was gonna say. The assertion that the PM in a UK-style system intrinsically has more power than the US presidency is plainly falsified by the events of the last couple years. Can they theoretically have more power, if they command a big majority in both houses? Sure. But then, a US president in a similar situation isn't very different in practice, however independent the legislative and executive branches may theoretically be."
"Much to the chagrin of pro-brexiteers, who routinely shouted about 'taking back control' and who were suddenly faced with our highest court unanimously giving our parliament sovereign power, and in effect took back control of the Brexit process from a 'do or die' brexiteer Prime Minister to a anti-hard-brexit parliament.

"and yet, despite this, together with the US and the UK, we have had one undisputed head of these states for decades - His Majesty, Rupert Murdoch."
Was the Australian senate elected?
This country is long overdue for a full-on revolution. New Constitutional Convention and all
"The fact that the other branches of government choose the judges that are to hold them accountable is ludicrous in the first place. Not that judges should be elected democratically, that's almost a worse proposition. I'm not sure what the ideal system is, but certainly not the current one. Maybe allowing current judges to independently pick new ones amongst themselves, coupled with some sort of mechanism that allows the people to voice their displeasure with the current court, in which case it's cleared out or something like that.

*Especially* the combo of politically-motivated nominations and lifetime appointments is an unmitigated disaster. If there are politically-motivated nominations (and there shouldn't be) then lifetime appointments mean something as random as the timing of someone's death can result in whoever currently holds political power gaining a semi-permanent hold over an entire branch of government for no reason. Not to mention, this dynamic means there's a strong incentive for the timings of those deaths to... become less random, if you catch my drift (not that it appears there have been any cases of foul play so far in recent history, to be fair, but the incentive being there is never a good thing)"
"Was that “once” the 2004 election?

"Even if Obama was perfect reincarnation of Reagan, that's not what they want, they want power and that means their own president, hopefully forever.."
"This. And those voters aren't going to be going away. If Trump is removed from office via impeachment or 2020 elections his voters will stay just as jaded, if not more so, than they already are. They just double down harder any time he faces criticism."
"I don't know what you consider the North but he won a lot of the [Northern states too](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president). And yeah he is surrounded by a lot of northern nutjobs like Giuliani also. And BTW, we can thank the north for the last recession and housing crises while we are at it. The danger this country faces comes from the north. Especially wall street. Carpet baggers are going to do what carpet baggers do."
"A plainly incorrect ruling would be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. Of course, they did get one of their clowns in there too, but at least they'd need to take over the entire Supreme Court to be able to get away with it."

"Zero sum games right? Their loss is Trump's gain in equal measure, right?"
"As I understood it, the higher court didn't decide either way, but put it on hold so they could take the time to make the right precedent.

The answer to that question is of course: Which way makes more money for Twitter. Means: we the people have to make it expensive for Twitter to keep him on.
"Yes. I’ve read quite a bit into US politics in the last 5 or so years, and I’m completely convinced the system is broken and corrupted. We have ministers being forced to resign by parliament because they didn’t disclose the justice department paid for something expensive for a mole who turned into a star witness etc.

The US is closer to mid 90s russia than to Europe."
"It sends a powerful message both ways, the president is not above the law. Good for justice, but it also shames the country for electing a crook into office to begin with. Arrest within office is a very catch 22 situation."

"A Velvet Revolution of course.

The idea that the judges would choose amongst themselves is an even worse proposition than public elections. It completely removes the ability of any check or balance to the power held by the Judiciary. Who would have the ability to check their power? No one.

"In the 1990's it lead to a hard nosed no nonsense PM who was going to slay the deficit/debt no matter what.

he did not. the people who invested in his casinos did. he made money by giving the casinos his brand name

"Fun totally unrelated fact of the day:

Term limits for US Presidents were never legally a thing until 1951. Before that, having only 2 terms for themselves was just a tradition that US Presidents just upheld. 

There are, of course, exceptions to this tradition. The absolute madlad Franklin Delano Roosevelt(FDR) served 4 terms before passing away in April 12th, 1945, during his 4th term. Harry S. Truman was known to have attempted another term, until he was convinced by his advisers to retire due to his failing health.

"I find it strange that they run 2 elections at the same time, but other than that it seems way better than ""appointed 'till 75"".

the major argument against it being a money laundering operation is that it should be virtually impossible to lose money in that situation. Typically the people who want their ill gotten gains to look legit will have to pay a premium to facilitate this. As a general rule they are willing to do deals where they actually lose money because they get spendable cash out of the arrangement.

"This was an amendment added to the constitution just after WW2. It would take an act of congress in order for that to be undone. The funny part of it is, it was added by Republicans after a democratic president won four consecutive terms and was the only president to do so at that time.
It was also during the great depression and the beginning of WW2; around this time Roosevelt had kept the US out of war and helped implement the New Deal to help boost the economy.

But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

Of course. What else do think is blowing the solar winds around?

Loved that movie. Rewatchable lvl 9999

TARRRRRSS!!
this was an amazing surprise to see while on lsd
MMMMMMMmmmmUUUUEEEEErrrrrrrFfffPppHhhhhhhhhh!!!!
Nice. I worked on interstellar as a stand in when they filmed the bookshelf scenes. No one had any clue what was going on haha
Also Dr Strange comes to mind
Best. Soundtrack. Ever.
Interstellar is literally my favorite movie of all time. So yes I am a fan.
Thats super trippy!
Pipe organ intensifies
Is there a book on interstellar? What’s the name of the book so I can purchase it! <3
Mind fuckkkkkk
Clear
The bookshelf dimension was my favorite as well it made so much sense. I love science!
I m dizzy
CMON TARS
Too infinity and beyond...
MURPH!!!
"IT’S NOT THEM, IT’S US!!"
Is it just me who got super dizzied by this?
"Come on, TARS!"

We have this exact set up at my uni library

it's more looks like an INCEPTION
What library is this btw?
Just had a seizure
"I'm big fan of space, but that SQL book right there literally puts me off.
Sometimes mixing computer science with space does not make a great pudding."
This part of the movie squashed my mind grapes.
What's the confusing bit?
Muuuuurf
Press _ to vault
They’re not beings they’re us
I’m not
" TARS: People didn’t build this library.

 Not yet... but one day. Not you and me but people, people who’ ve evolved beyond the four dimensions we know.

That line about the prospect of humanity is amazing!"
"I would run around yeeting books out of the shelves, doing morse code and scream MURRRRRPPPHHH until I get kicked out"
Still my favourite movie to this day.
D
How is this confusing perspective? 22k upvotes for this
Yesssssssss the best fan interstellar fan is me

Im surprised the bookshelf isnt going down due to the knocks matt damon does to let us notice he s there
"Other than the top comment, all others are trash. I'm getting older and have forgotten about my local library.
May they live on doing what they do.

Also, how do I help my local library?"
Bad movie but sweet picture
Kinda looks like the hole trump supporters see when they realize the impeachment he's about to go through.
"r/damnthatsinteresting

Surprised my local libraries aren’t doing that"
That's a neat way to cut down on librarians interrupting amature porn shoots.
"This whole setup reminds me of one floor of the old library where I worked. As we where midway moving to a new library (which is quite the thing, moving millions of book across town) we had a floor with shelves like in the picture halfway empty.  
  
These book shelves are very sturdy and stable, except when empty (you see where this is going...). As one of the movers bumped in to one of the first empty rows, the biggest game of falling dominoes every unrolled. Toppled four still full rows of shelves over before the chain reaction stopped.  
  
That made for a few hours extra that day, removing the mess, re-sorting the books and packing them up."
Unless there are so many books on row 2 that you cant look past it.
Oh.  I thought the picture taker just threw them all on the ground lol.
"Yeah, right. That's how that happened... Edit: sorry. Now I understand. And you were pretty clear."
"It's a fancy way of having the empty tables at the end of each aisle being the ""book return""."
"My dumb ass:  Fuck, don’t remember where this went.  Where can I put this; semi full shelf or empty one?  Better go with semi full so no one notices how stupid I am."
Now this is the BIG BRAIN
I thought OP moved them out the way only to take this photo and I was thinking wow what a massive hole they've dug. Makes alot more sense!
"...kaaay. What is the prupose of the canted frame? Just to ""look cool?"""
Neat
"Uh. These are workstations. How wpuld it help to see if 5 % of the books are on their spot ?

U guys are so stupid bahaha.

What are you gonna tell us next ? Gloryholes in bathrooms are for doctors to see if your poop is healthy ?"
"This sounds like bullshit, really well worded bullshit, but still bullshit"
Why not just put the book where you took it from?
I zoomed in to check if someone was staring back.
"Do you?

EDIT: Serious question. I'm genuinely unsure if this means I should watch it too?"
It's a masterpiece.
That's one damn good movie!
That movie is an insane movie and  affected me so much that I can only watch it once
"I watched the movie then I had further watch the Gunbuster (Japan Anime). 

The exp from Movie help me a lot to understand the Anime and I imagine how confused I would be without."

The whole bookshelf thing was the only shit thing about the entire movie though.

Best scene of the movie.
That was so funny to me since the soundtrack behind that is called no time for caution. Seemed like a meta joke and that's how I took it

"Yeah, watched it recently and it's exactly like I watched it for the first time"
There's a book?!
Yeah looks like La Trobe Uni :)
Gang gang
"Makes me think too:

>!like why did they pick the water planet first if the time dilation is an expected effect. It just seems like really poor risk management based decision making on the part of the astronaut team when that property of the planet is a reasonably precise known quantity. Also, shouldn’t they have known something was up with that signal?!<"
"This is a great movie, but the line where the kid coughs and says “the dust” is the weirdest piece of editing to make it to final cut I’ve ever seen."
That shit makes you fly
‘Let’s shake some dust!’
Dust is all you need!
I always chant “come on TARS!!” every time our roomba is getting back into its dock lmao
"What's your humour setting, TARS?"
"Yea that was the point tho, murph got upset by that line and stormed off if I recall"
Was gonna say the same thing

[Did you see this at the end? pretty neat](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/207/210/b22.jpg)
Do it. It’s one of my favorite space dimensional movies. So much that I have it downloaded onto my laptop so I can watch it whenever I have no backup plan.
"It's one of my studio movies. Aka, I put it on in the background while I work. Of course, that's after I watched it easily six dedicated times. So I'm probably in the high teens by now. I think the only movie I've seen more is pulp fiction."
It's very good IMO.
"If not for the story, the music.

I have the soundtrack and it's great, but listening to it with the movie is just more complete."
Also watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s similar but so much better and with a more confusing ending.
Are you?
Yes?
Yes yes it’s sooo good I love it. Very immersive. And the soundtrack is phenomenal too. And I may have cried. More than once.
If you haven't seen it yet I wholeheartedly recommend it. Great film!
"Interstellar was 2 hours and 49 minutes of Matthew McConaughey begging forgiveness for every shitty rom com he has ever been in. . . and Reign of Fire. 

Watch it."
It's a masterpiece.
The movie is worth repeated watches .. even more than Big Lebowski
Yes. Phenomenal movie
I'm so happy to see so much praise here. It's one of my favorites but generally when Interstellar comes up people come out of the woodwork to shit on it.
It's incredible
"Gotta be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie itself - but the soundtrack and the visuals were out of this world. Pun intended."
It’s the only thing you should be doing
"If you went into the film expecting realism, I get that.

I take it as a poetic element. For me it works."
"I appreciate it, took balls to “go for it”"
"I disagree, that shit was dope."
"It's not bullshit it was actually incredibly well handled

I can hear this. One of my favourite scenes ever.
Best movie of the decade.
I really liked the lead up before it after Damon attacks him. There's something kinda human / compelling about him failing his mission and just wanting to get home - *trying* to justify killing Coop to himself then failing to do that too.
Rage... rage... against the dying of the light.
Tick..tick.. tick.. tick..
Damn you got me beat
Looks like there are several thousand books.
There’s a novel adaptation of the film. It’s meh really. And I LOVE the film!
"Which part of the film is that? Also which La Trobe uni, there are a few."
"They picked the water planet because they are hoping that the water planet IS THE ONE. 

Miller sent a signal. They knew there's time dilation but they hoped that it could be the one. Remember that they limited resources. If they struck gold on the first planet out of three, then that's good and efficient for their resources.

Also, there's absolutely no way of knowing if the planet is the one. They have no choice but to go down and check."
"Get out of here, this is a wholesome moment"
"She did indeed, suppose it shows how effective the scene was that i as the viewer reeled back from it as well."
LEAVE LET ME MURPH DONT!!

"i wonder if she always refers to him as ""Mr. librarian sir"""
SHHHHH. The *secret* daily nerf battle.
I knew what this was but did it anyway.
I'm sitting in a cafe by myself and I couldn't help laughing out loud as I saw it. Thank you
"Can someone explain me what the joke is, please?"
I strongly recommend watching it. One of the best space movies out there
Watch Annihilation instead.. It's better!
What are some other? genuinely asking.
"All these years, and many, many viewings later - at the end-sequence of the movie I STILL ask ""what the actual fuck is that about?"""
I had to watch Reign of Fire a few times before I realized that was Matthew McConaughey. It might be a cheesy movie but I still think it’s one of his better performances. He hadn’t ever really played a character like that and I still think he’s fairly unrecognizable when I watch it now.
Yea as the rest of the movie was trying to be so realistic (to the point that there was a lot of dialogue where the actors just explain to the audience what’s happening) the bookshelf felt like it came out of nowhere.
"I agree, it was in an attempt to explain the unexplainable and I appreciate how they went about it."
"Now, when you say ""It's not bullshit"" and mention your dad, his mates, and 2 of the most well known physisists, are you proposing that a consciousness could survive travelling through one of an infinite number of singularities, and then influence one of yet again an infinite number of locations throughout the infinite universe? I didn't hate the movie. I thought it was brilliant. But you could say the bookshelf was the proverbial jumped shark."
Interstellar soundtrack is one of the best pieces of music ever composed for a film.
"No, it's necessary"
CMOOOOON TARRRSSSSS
How much time he got that man is...
Damn better get started
"But here’s the problem with that: 

They *hope*, they don’t *know*. 

Ok, fine to check however if there’s something wrong that causes any kind of delay then the impact of that setback is amplified dramatically by the time dilation which is a known quantity and therefore a measurable risk factor (which of course we see in the film). 

Resources are finite, but time is also a resource and they burn through quite a lot of it because something inevitably didn’t go to plan, and because they are on Miller the impact is amplified almost to the point of complete mission failure compared to the relatively light challenges (though still deadly, and deftly handled) they encountered.

That’s poor risk assessment and bad decision making when there are other reasonable options available to explore using the resources allowing that."
"I'm a big fan of Nolan, and I'd say Interstellar is easily my least favorite of his.  I love the score and the visuals, but the story and performances feel schlocky to me.  To answer your question, 2001 is one of my all-time favorites and was a huge inspiration for me to enter the film industry.

In terms of other cerebral space-y movies, I really enjoy Solaris (the Tarkovsky one), and films like Moon and Annihilation scratch that itch despite not quite reaching ""greatness"" levels.  I also heard good things about High Life from Claire Denis though I haven't had a chance to watch it yet."
Hanz Zimmer music intensifies.

Then a book shelf falls on him just as he starts to explain the importance of the book throwing.

MATT DAMON!!!
This is a first for me. I've never been library shushed over the internet before. We are truly living in the future.
"Are librarians forbidden to show any sort of joy during work? They are always so quiet and boring, but TIL that Librarian Nerf Battles are a thing."
I just wanted to make sure it was exactly what I expected it to be.
I kind of miss the dickbutt days
"Also one of the most realistic space movies kinda. All theories about space and time and gravitation are put in there like they are real. As far as I'm aware, they even hired physicians to help them make it as real as possible. Even tho it's sci-fi, it's kind of real if we think about the facts of the black hole that we're discovered."
Excellent space movie but I still hated the part with Matt Damon.
Anything that John Williams and Hans Zimmer do is great
Not that I disagree but it also reminded me of going to the nether in Minecraft
INITIATING SPIN!!
He was in the non-friction area.
No book is too big. No Library is too big.
the first rule of isbn:0393039765
Physicists helped a lot too
Yes the black hole gynecology physicians
"I like to think that I can have a pretty good grasp on topics, but man does that movie make me feel stupid"
Most of the things put in there are real/realistic but IIRC there were some parts that aren't.
I was especially pleased to find out that their physicist consultants confirmed that the power of love can transcend space and time.
"Almost. They spend so much time giving a pretty solid explanation of special relativity, but fail completely at basic orbital mechanics. Remember that part where they go to the ocean planet that's really close to the black hole? They chose that one because they only had so much fuel and it was closer. The problem is that distance isn't limited by fuel, but your ability to enter and exit gravity is. It takes just about as much fuel to get to the moon as it takes to get to Mars. It takes a whole lot more fuel to get back from the surface of Mars than the moon, because you have to climb out of a much deeper gravity well. You know what is in a reeeeally deep gravity well? A planet so close to a fucking black hole that special relativity becomes a serious concern."
Yeah that was unexpected and i can see how some may not like it but imagine how it must feel to land on a shitty planet where youll die and be completely alone the whole time. Must be pretty wack yo
When I saw it on release night that was totally out of left field him being in it. He is sort of the master of cameos in a way.
John Williams is the exact reason I mentioned “one of the best” and not “the best” :)

not as much as the physicians
"Actually, it' a bit the other way around. 
1- The well know relativity/black holes expert Kip Thorne wrote a story (with physics stuff but without Love bs)
2- Brother of Nolan picked it up and rewrote it with ecology bs
3- Nolan took it and rewrote it including Love bs (just kidding, I like the movie the way it is). Kip Thorne was to be part of it, you imagine that now.
one source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)#Development_and_financing"
Just put your feet in the stirrups.
I was watching it yesterday and had to rewind to listen more carefully everytime they talk about the science stuff.
"The only unreal part that physicist Kip Thorne (who was the principal advisor for the film) didnt like was the ice clouds as that was just impossible. All the other bits can happen. The ice clouds were just too theatrical:) 

I love the movie because of its grandiose and still very real depiction of space. It felt humbling as well as inspiring and scary too. Was let down by the narrative though. Thats a story I have written as a child a hundred-times over. And I was and am a shitty idiot. They could have written a better story to go with that insanely beautiful storytelling. 

Still, worth several views. Inspiring stuff overall."
Green corn don't burn
Haha I figured
lmao I’m so happy these 2 comments are here.
"Time dilation is fucking terrifying. 

Going 30min too long on the surface and they're lucky their ship in orbit still existed much less their crew member not going completely insane not knowing if his team was dead... years later."
"Ice clouds were neat tho, rule of cool must sometimes our way science."
The space book shelf was a bit out of left field and not what I’d call realistic.
It was a real corn field that they grew just for the movie. And they actually burned part of it
"And the person they went down to find, because of the time dilation had basically only just crashed and died moments before."
"I mean being in orbit around the planet still leaves you at the same dilation as those on the planet.

Proximity to planet doesn't matter, proximity to the black hole will mess you up."
"Sure. But that’s not something expressly deemed impossible by science as we know it. Even theoretically speaking the ice clouds were an overkill. For Thorne. I kinda liked it, silly though as it was. :)"
"I think that was supposed to represent a way to visualize dimensions.
It can look like however you envision it, it just represents a theory."
"Yeah but the beings there had changed the surroundings to something he could comprehend, I think."
"Well if you’re that close to a black hole, yes."

No need to yell.
"Well, I wouldn't want computers judging my comments anyway"
I'd be mortified if my computer could read what I say about it in the comments
Docstrings would like a word.
Computers don't read
"Depends on your definition of failure. My comments are usually to explain why I did some janky shit, yes, but nobody knows every best way to accomplish everything. Sometimes you just gotta look at the clock, admit you don't know a more elegant solution, and then just do what works and leave a note for the next guy or gal.

And sometimes you simply don't have a reasonable choice except to do some janky shit, if you're working with a flawed API or interfacing with legacy code. And sometimes that third party, remote hosted app with obfuscated JS that your client insists on using didn't provide you with an event hook so you just sigh heavily and write setTimeout then feel the need to apologize to whoever reads it next."
"> On the other hand, if you have to write a comment you already failed writing your code properly.

This statement ignores doc comments/docstrings/javadocs/etc. Even with those aside, there are so many idiosyncracies about code that can't be communicated through comments.

- ""<X> is the more obvious way to do this, but we do <Y> instead because it's faster and this function is on the hot path.""
- ""We temporarily break the type's invariants here but we've ensured nobody else can observe the broken state before it's fixed again.""
- ""TODO: replace this with <Z> once we update to somelib v2.x."" 
- ""Constants declared here are copied from https://example.com/some_page.""
- ""This call \*must not be moved before <W> method call\* to ensure memory safety.""

""Perfect code needs no comments"" assumes that every developer/maintainer from now until forever knows as much as the author does about the codebase, which won't even be true of that same author a week later. And since all of those comments are about implementation details, they don't belong in method names or documentation. You should only eschew comments if you have both perfect code and perfect maintainers. Given we're all fallible humans or code written by fallible humans, we have neither."
I feel bad for anyone you work with if you think this is true.
"It depends. I like to have comments because what if someone who has never coded before looks at the code?

I would like them to at least know what's going on"
"You are absolutely correct! Comments are a failure of expressing intent or explaining through code. 

But mostly you do name functions/classes/variables properly. 

Which means that when you see a comment it’s probably worth reading!"
"Comments are an important part of documenting your code, you should have one with each method/function explaining:
- Parameters/arguments passed
- Explanation of the code running inside if it is complex
- Return value
- Exceptions caught/thrown
- Where the function/method is used

If you don’t comment your code and you work in a team, yo mum’s a hoe."
or with sorting it could be to say increasing or decreasing order without having to pass a value for that each time
"Saying commenting is a failure makes me believe you are fairly new to programming. There are so many instances where a quick comment can save time later. Maybe you can simplify a code block once a feature is released, so you make a quick comment. Maybe a bad piece of code is battle tested so you leave it for now but you also did some investigating into refactoring. Commenting there for another dev could save the company money."
Even the perfect code needs to be analyzed. You must be terrible to work with.
Lmao it's so obvious that you never had a serious job in programming before

"I would argue the intent of the book about commenting is to stop _describing_ your code. Stop doing `int x = a + b; // add a and b`. Instead documentation should discuss _why_ the code exists. Not _what_ the code does (unless it’s not obvious in complicated situations). This is because code evolves and docs explaining implementation decisions gets outdated quickly but docs explaining why (minus a few exceptions) last much longer and remain more relevant over time. 

Most of your examples are _why_ the code exists which would be more than acceptable/useful to any future readers. 

Commenting is a delicate balance."

You can write the doc-code, which is meant to exist. But if you do, think why it should be there and what its purpose is.

>If you don’t comment your code and you work in a team, yo mum’s a hoe.

Of course I comment my code. But I also make sure I don't need to rephrase what the name of everything means. I explain what I meant to do and what I expect to happen."

Why does it say to use spaces instead of tabs?
But job security
‘uninitiated’? Accepted PEPs are a central part of the standard.
I had so many habits of omitting spaces which are extremely difficult to break after 8 years without linters or code reviews. I worry I'll never truly change that muscle memory. But at least eslint is there nowadays to constantly remind me as I type.
"Hmm, not in keyword arguments of functions."
Even parenthesis? ( i += j ); vs (i += j);
"* If you're using space indentation you might get into situation where you press Backspace 2-4 times to unindent, because some text editors don't do that for you
* Tabs have variable width. That's why you can just change tabs width back to 2 or even 1. Again, not all text editors can do a similar thing to space-indented files.
* Aligning with tabs definitely sucks, so I stick to ""tab-indent space-align"" rule - this way you can change tabs width to fit the code with deep nesting on the screen without breaking alignment of code.

But I do have to say, that in the end, every time you write code, look 3 months or 3 years later at it and don't understand it, it's simply your fault. And he mentions a lot of techniques how to improve that. Also his main focus is on Object Oriented and high level Programming... which kinda makes sense regarding some clean code guidlines."

This feels like one of those things that's kinda better not to know about because odds are you'll abuse it. Like metaclasses.
"Why would it be tabs? I don't really have strong opinions on that, because a modern editor will just format the file however you want to see it regardless of tabs or spaces, but in my experience 90% of style guides for just about any language recommend spaces for indentation."
"Sure but the comment that brought up spaces after comments was a user who is new to programming. They are asking about a really well known rule and probably have never heard of PEP.

In practice some professional engineers are also unaware, from personal experience."
"FWIW there’s also [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) to do the same thing for Python as eslint does for JS, and [RuboCop](https://www.rubocop.org/en/stable/) for Ruby."

">Used 4x less space

Even all that space together is almost nothing. You gain safety instead which is a worthwhile trade.

>allows easier navigation, especially with Vim.

I am using Vim full-time for the last \~7-8 Years with Python and GO. One uses tabs one uses spaces and I can't figure out why you think tabs would allow for easier navigation. 

I am hesitant to say that you are using vim wrong, but you probably are."
"If you have the need for speed, you don't use python.  The whole point of python is that it is easy to read and write, so if you're going to do away with that then just use a different language from the get go."
You are probably an outlier. In my industry readability is much more important than those marginal gains. I used to work with a giant corporation where it had a few Python hipsters that treated the code like some dick slinging contest. Shit was really tiresome for us juniors. I  am a senior now but I very rarely use those advanced concepts in my code. I just don’t understand why and would be glad to see if I’m wrong.
Comment
City I used to live in had a bar/laundromat called “The Wash & Slosh” used to go there for punk and grindcore shows when I was young. Kind of ironic now that I think about it.
Get wasted while taking care of laundry. Sounds like fun.
From detergents to deterred gents.
They should really make a shot called “Tide Pods”
Or is your local bar also a laundromat?
"Look I'm just saying. Sometimes it's okay to let the whites and coloreds mix.

My laundromat in Rhode Island had a bar too. It was called Drinking Nips of Jameson in the Car for an Hour.
I had a group of apartment dwelling friends who would go to a 24 hour laundromat and get hammered waiting on their laundry.  This seems better.
But do they have enough security cameras?
Sounds like a great idea until I have to carry all my laundry home and have to put it away drunk. And I don't like to let my clean clothes sit in my basket
Our drinking team has a pool problem.
Is it called The Soap Bar?

"In my hometown we had a place called King Arthur's Washing Well. It had a large arcade on one side, a laundromat on the other, and a pub in the middle. The bar ran right into the prize stand. It was great.

"I've seen a place like this. Called ""Washabeeria""."

That’s F’n genius. I can’t begin to tell you how many times I went to a bar waiting for my laundry.
What an excellent idea! You can wash your clothes AND kill time

"I've always wondered why more places like this don't exist. It seems like a no brainer, even if you're only serving sandwiches or something rather than getting a liquor license"

I thought about doing that. Probably because of shameless
"I grew up in rural Ireland. We had a menswear shop with a bar, a womenswear ship with a bar, a grocery store with a bar, a veterinary store with a bar, and the best of all... a bar with someone’s house in it."

"This would be a problem for me, I’d get loaded and forget my laundry."
There's one down in Henderson NV on Boulder Highway also.
My local bar is also a laundromat
"There used to be a place in Cincinnati called Sudsy Malone’s. It was a laundromat/bar/concert venue. Story goes that you could get in for free to use the laundromat no matter what was going on, so all the punk kids would go to a thrift store, buy $2 worth of clothes, get in for way cheaper than the price of admission, ditch the clothes somewhere, and see the shows"

Where I used to live in the south this was a thing. Also carwashes converted into beer thrus. You literally would just drive through coolers of booze and some guy would get it for you.
I saw one of these in New Orleans. Somehow it made perfect sense there.
University of wash in Tulsa is something along those lines
I had one near me in college. “Suds and buds”
That's fucking cool.
"Boulder Co. used to have a ""Suds and Duds"", always liked that name."

Well now when I want to tell my wife that I’m going to the laundromat I can get shit faced and completely forget to do the laundry it’s a win win
Actually nice
So was it a bar then a laundromat? Or a laundromat then a bar? Or did it open with a laundromat and a bar? And how the fuck did a laundromat get a liquor license? I have so many questions.
My uncle recently had an... abrupt change  in lifestyle and so had to start using a laundromat again and so went to the local bar/ laundromat and said it was a depressing group of middle aged men who just... hung out in the bar/laundromat. He did not go back.
I would forget so many loads there.
"We've got quite a few of those here in New Orleans. Put a load in, grab a drink at the bar, shoot some pool, swap um to the dryer, grab a burger, play some video poker, grab your clothes and you're done! Even better, they're 24/7"
Oh cool. I will just put my underwear in the wash in front of people and hope they don't look and/or jeer.
What’s with the fridge?
"Ah shit, what movie is this from? It's something like a woman goes on a date here but her boss turns up and sees her and gets jealous...? Can't quite place it."

"Are these not fairly common? My city is small but has at least 3 that I'm aware of with food and beer and a pool table or pinball machines or something. They've been around for years

They used it as a second stage for a small festival not long ago!"

My laundromat when I was younger had a bar next door. They also had a Mexican restaurant on the other side. I could get a burrito and a beer while I was waiting for my laundry.

***My local bar is also a laundromat:)***
They have one of these in the town I am from in TX. It was called the Scrub Pub.
That's actually really awesome. I'd love to go and meet randos over a brew while waiting for laundry
"thats so cool, I want to live somewhere which is a laundromat bar too"
This is one of the best possible ideas!!
That is so smart
It also has Slot machines to the right & pool table to the left
Why do laundromats still exist?
"it makes sense, since anyone using a laundry mat is low class to begin with"
"I hate to be a party pooper here, but doesn’t this seem like a recipe for DUIs? Assuming most people drive to the laundromat, and laundry can take several hours to get done, so you’re gonna drink, then drive home after... idk seems likely that some people might overdo it on the drinks and overestimate their driving skills/ability to get home afterwards"
Just looks like a bar with a washing machine.
Suds and Duds
The Sit & Spin :)
"Saskatoon, right? I heard they took Canadian Tire money at one point too."
Oh my gosh I’m down to mosh at the wash and slosh
We have one here on my college campus called suds and duds. They have bands playing weekly and nightly karaoke along with alchohol!
When I lived in Seattle in the late 90's there was a laundromat/cafe/music venue called Sit and Spin.
Portland has a laundry/coffee shop/tap house called ‘Spin’
"The Soapbox in Wilmington NC (just learned that it's now closed) used to have great live shows, cold PBR, and a full on laundrymat. It was a 3 in one as well."
"Common im the Northwest. 
I miss that in California."
Ah haven't listened to grindcore in a long while. Takes me back!
"Saskatoon! Man, that was a wild place sometimes. Memories."
Same
"My friend runs a gallery out of a laundro, and the one next to my office is also a cafe!"
I was just going to post about the wash and slosh!! I miss that place.
Saskatoon?
Hey my current city used to have a bar called the wash n slosh
Saskatoon ?
Ahh Saskatoon.
"wash, slosh, and mosh."
We had a place like that in Cincinnati too. RIP Sudsy’s.
Came here to say this.
That sounds badass!!
I thought this was wash and slosh. I saw cannibal corpse and napalm death there in 2000. Pilsners were on sale.
"I know the city of which you speak. I've spent a night or many at the Wash & Slosh myself, especially when my coworker's band was playing."
Ironic...ha
Ironic how?
Sounds like my early 20s
I always used to go late and take a beer when I had to go to the laundry mat.
Sounds like many a night when I woke up the next day with wet clothes still sitting in the washing machine.
"Guess who has 2 thumbs and a new reason to do laundry, other than my parents' hollow threats to kick me out. 

This deadbeat!"
Fun with chores
"""Honey, will you bring me a beer after you start the laundry.  And a sandwich. Wash what you are wearing too then come over here to keep warm. ""

Yup

Game's on."
"Drinking actually gets me to do chores. Because I stop deliberating and just get to it. A Puerto Rican coworker said something about alcohol helping his people get housework done, so I guess it’s not just me. Or I’m Puerto Rican, I haven’t ~~thrown away money~~ done 23 and Me."
"For real.  They have bars in movie theaters and arcades, and you actually have other activities to do there.  A laundromat though?  You just sit and wait."
"My husband and I used to go to the restaurant next door to the laundromat while our clothes were busy being cleaned: 1) put the clothes in the washer 2) go next door and order dinner, and have a couple of drinks 3) switch laundry to dryer just before dinner arrives, and 4) by the time dinner is over, the laundry's done. We calculated we spent several thousand dollars a year at that restaurant while we were ""doing the laundry""."
There’s a joke in all of this about loads.
Not to mention laundry is super easy to do even if you're blackout wasted
Id think the hardest thing about this idea would be getting the license
"I moved, had a large comforter on my bed that was overdue for a wash and knew it wouldn't fit in my new washing machine.  I googled laundry mats, found one nearby and went at like 10pm on a Tuesday.  They were open till 12.  I was like one of 4 people there, one being a mother who was doing laundry while her son about 8, lay on the ground and did his homework.  That's when I was just a little happier to have a stable household growing up."
"As a “fun” idea I agree, it’s pretty good and very likable.  But seriously.... If your financial position involves  having to deal w doing off-site laundry (and I’ve been there), the last thing you should be doing is pissing your money away at a *laundromat bar*.   Save your pennies and at least find a place w laundry down the hall."
I'll allow it.

"I like the term ""nips"". It makes it seem like you're a cheeky fella biding his time and not an alcoholic."
Their way sounds cheaper though.
"This was the 70's and 80's for me, that and poker in the laundromat- everybody always had cash and coins and shit"
Good catch. Most over the register from all angles.  Someone was pocketing an extra bonus is my guess.
The basket is a dresser though.
I enjoy cleaning way more after some drinks. I'll slap my headphones on and dance around cleaning things that normally get ignored.

You mean fucking awesome!
"The laundromats in Santa Barbara often had arcade games in them the last time I was there, which was back in 2010 when I was there for college. 

One of the laundromats even had Lucky & Wild. That game where you drive with one hand and shoot with the other."
"Yes! Took way too long to find a comment about Sudsy’s. Spent a decent number of Saturday nights there in college (along with Top Cats, Mad Frog, Max Hatter, the original Southgate House...). Cincy was a great place for live music in the mid ‘00s."
Where is it? That sounds genuinely interesting.
"> a bar with someone’s house in it.
That's where people got laid.  Guaranteed."
"Idk... As someone who drinks through social anxiety, this would’ve really helped with my laundromat experiences."
Got em in rural parts of RI too.
Damn what was it called. C-something C-something...
It is.

Suck a wiener sit and spin
McDonald's used to have those in the playplace when I was a kid.  It was like the Teacups at Disneyland but a bit bigger and shaped like a hamburger.  You could spin around as fast as you wanted and after a minute or so you felt like the world was upside down and you were going to fall into space.  It was amazing but they must have had safety issues cuz I haven't seen one for many years.
"Hahaha yeah it was Saskatoon! And it wouldn’t surprise me that they took crappy tire money, it did seem like that kind of place."
I grew up in really rural northern NY. My local used to take post-dated checks. It was the best.

Probably because crusty punks and thrashaholics are notorious for wearing the same filthy clothes for months at a time. An establishment meant for cleaning clothes full of these people is a pretty solid example of situational irony."

"When I was this age, I lived a few blocks from a laundromat that had a few arcade games in it, including NFL Blitz. So you know every other Friday, early evening, was my roommates and I getting sneaky drunk while doing laundry and having a Blitz tournament."
Pretty sure half the people at any given laundromat are drinking.
Where'd you get the other 23?
You have bars in your movie theaters????
They should really have laundry machines at the movie theatre and sell double feature + laundry tickets.
Thank you for your analysis
"I knew a couple people who did laundry at a laundromat then walk like half a block to a bar , two places like that .. not connect though, I need to come up with that here"
"A bar just fits into any situation.

Grocery store bar, laundromat bar, movie theater bar, oil change bar, my mil house on Christmas Eve.

There's always a good reason to drink."
Technically in the theatre you sit and wait ...
Wait a second... How about a laundromat with a bar... AND an arcade?!
Can't you go do something else while the machine is running?
"They should have a laundry at the movies really. Put your washing in, go watch your film, come out, it's done!"
We do that same thing but at the McDonald's across the parking lot
When you put it in quotes at the end like that it really makes me think that dinner was just a metaphor in that story and you two were just screwing in the parking lot.
My husband and I found our favorite coffee shop because it was in the same strip of stores as the laundromat. We eventually went almost every day and my husband worked there for a while.
"Im from North EU, we dont have such establishments. Cant you just buy a washing machine / dryer if you can spend thousands at a restaurant getting your clothes clean?"
Loads of fun
"I don't know about you, but the times I have been blackout wasted I don't think I was capable of doing anything, while simultaneously being capable of doing everything, and it seems like there's no rational thought going on up there. I would not trust blackout roscoeakl to make sure my laundry got all my laundry home, clean, and not left on the side of the road, or covered with any combination of beer/piss/vomit/shit."

I thought it was the weirdest thing ever when I first moved to Reno but getting a few drinks while waiting for laundry is a damn good idea.
by meadowood. love that place.
I didn’t know that existed in Reno. How neat. I’ll have to check it out sometime!

It used to be a franchise chain but I think they're no longer a chain. There's a couple in Iowa too

"Luckily there's a laundromat nearby that you can use to get your shirt and pants clean. You can also get some fries to soak up some acid and alcohol, and wash it down with a beer in the nearby bar while you wait. 

Rinse.  Repeat. (I really wanted to say that.)"
"[TIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tire_money)

That is ~~a~~ real fuckin’ weird."
Clever plot by big laundry to keep you in an endless cycle of cleaning.
"reminds me of a joke:

a dude was getting wasted in a bar with acquaintances when a burp turned on him and he puked all down himself.  “oh man,” dude said, “my wife knows i drink on occasion but hates it when i get drunk.  she’s going to kill me!”

“don’t worry,” said one of his drinking buddies, “all you gotta do is this:  put a twenty in your breast pocket.  when your wife asks, tell her you were in a bar and a drunk puked on you.  tell her he gave you a twenty for cleaning and she’ll be fine.”

“that’s genius!” said the dude and kept on drinking.

later that night, dude stumbled home and was greeted by his irate wife.  “ you’ve been in a bar!” she accused, “and you’ve vomited all over your shirt!”

“no, no,” dude slurred, “i had a few but i’m not drunk.  it was some dipsomaniac who puked on me in the bar.  but don’t worry, he put a twenty in my breast pocket to pay for the cleaning.  take a look.”

the wife reached in dude’s breast pocked and pulled out two bills.  “here’s the twenty but there’s also a fifty.  what’s up with that?”

“oh yeah,” said the dude, “ he also shit my pants.”"
It’d be sweet if they had a Grand Theft Auto arcade machine in there too. Every time you died you could take a shot. “WASTED”
"Ya, most of the nicer Marcus and Regal theaters have upgraded to include bars around here.  They are trying to replicate the IPic and Emagine theaters who started it."
Welcome to the wonderful world of Alamo Drafthouse.
"Around here I think ALL the movie theaters are licensed now.

Most of them have switched to the big recliner seats that you reserve in advance too, and some of them bring food and drinks right to your seat.

I haven't seen the cheap seats in years (I think they only use them for kids movies), the one place that had em went out of business. Everyone's willing to pay the extra $2."
Bars and restaurants.
Both our cinemas are licensed. At certain times they also offer seat service where they can bring beer to your seat.
There's a movie theater near me that has a full brewery.
A couple of the AMC here in California have them now too. The really fancy one have full service as well.
"The movie theatre near me has a separate theatre where all the seats are recliners, and they bring a full menu of food and alcohol to your seat and you can order stuff lol"
"I can't actually eat and drink while watching a movie on the big screen. And the food isn't half bad, nor pricey. 12 bux for a burger with fries. Beer is like 6."
Yeah where are you from?
My state is finally putting beer and wine in gas stations and grocery stores so I'm with you.
Our AMC just got one last month
You don't?
It's basically the only way cinemas operate in the UK now

"Reno represent! Honestly, Reno is such a hidden gem now. Has evolved so much in the last few years."
"My laundromat is in the same complex as the state controlled liquor store, so the best we’ve come up with is getting a bunch of little bottles, pouring them in soda cans in the parking lot, and basically pulling an it’s always Sunny moment. 

I really like the thought of legally having a fucking beer at the laundromat!"
"I feel like if I moved to Reno, I'd prepare myself not to be surprised by anything."
Until you start washing clothes everyday just to get away.
Or you could save up and buy your very own washing machine! And do whatever you like instead of pay inflated drink prices while you wait.

Also the endless cycle of alcoholism
"There was this chain where I grew up in Vancouver (Washington) called Cinetopia that had a whole half of the theatre called “The Living Room” where you had to be 21 to go in because they serve alcohol, but they had love seats and bigger chairs, and the option for food and beverages to be catered to you. I think they recently shut down all locations though."
Theres actually a move theater/brewery called Flix brewhouse. They brew their own beer and you even have a button when your watching the movie to order another round or some food.
"Wow that’s super cool! I’m from Norway, and I don’t belive anything like that exists here... would be dope (and expensive) :)))"
"There's an iPic around here, but don't know if they serve alcohol. My first exposure to the concept was another place around here called Cinebarre, which has been doing it for a long time."

"I'm in Reno every year for a bit and I always say I could see myself moving there eventually. Great progressive arts scene, lots to do, mountains, desert, friendly people? Great city.

I actually scoped out this exact laundromat a couple years ago for a laundry stop while I was traveling. I ended up not needing to go and I was almost bummed because the reviews made it sound so great XD"
"With the way rent and house prices have gone up the past 10 years I'm not so sure you can call it ""hidden"" anymore..."
I believe that's called gentrification.
So much has changed in just the past few years! I love Reno - even the scuzzier aspects of it - a lot has been done to clean the place up. I’m just not really loving the rent increases. Ugh.
[deleted]
Has it actually gotten that much better? Honestly asking. I traveled there for business a few times about 6 or 7 years ago and the only thing I could say about it was that I figured it would be what Vegas looked like after the apocalypse.
"There’s nothing wrong with having an Always Sunny moment! Shit, it’s pretty fun actually. 

Yeah, Reno totally tripped me out at first. I’m from California where alcohol can’t be sold after 2am so I was blown away at it being available 24/7. We have this family/kid friendly place with bowling, mini golf, an indoor play structure AND IT HAS A BAR. Up until some years ago, smoking was still allowed at the bar. Inside a kids place. So weird. I love it here but over the years my view on alcohol has become very skewed. It’s everywhere and it’s just normal to me."
"The how is that they're basically physical rewards points

It really isn't that difficult of a concept tbh"
They got bought out by AMC. Regal is buying up smaller theater bars in the area too but leaving everything the same. Even the original Regal theaters are serving alcohol now. It's great!
"I have this where I live in California, it’s called Pruneyard Cinemas. It has a bar and kitchen attached to the theater and on your seat is a button you use to page an employee to take your drink/food order. Fun when you’re with a group of friends watching a comedy and have money to spend."
"Really with the way technology is now why do we have to sit in crammed ass theaters to watch a movie. I get when the big screen was a higher def and you couldn't beam everything into your house but now a days theaters are so dated. 

But if there was a room I could rent for 5 or 10 people with food and beer I'd actually go watch the movies in theater's. I'm just not into sitting with 500 people to watch something. It's not about the money to me it's the experience. 

I'll wait to watch it on my 4k surround sound from the comfort of my recliner."
"Same with Arclight. My favorite thing with that place is there's only 3 trailers and no ads, it really makes a huge difference."
"i just moved here for work, originally from Ottawa. was the first thing here i saw that really made it feel like i was home lol"
Ah the hipsters
What's goin on in Idaho right now?
It's a tough balance because if you get there too early you have to watch shitty commercials and piss halfway through the movie.

No..  it's a barrel."
"There's still plenty of meat on that bone. You take this home, throw it in a pot with some broth, maybe a potato, and baby, you got a stew goin'."
Plus they all still have the orange caps on them. If those were from drug addicts half the caps would be missing.
There are free needle programs in some cities to prevent this. Needles are cheaper than treatment for HIV.
Here in Seattle you can get free needles for so reason other than clean drug use.
"Speaking from experience, you'd be surprised. A pack of 10 needles is like $3 and it's not uncommon to buy several packs at a time, or boxes off the internet. This picture could easily be outside a dope house or at a homeless encampment."
"I came here to say that. These look like needles used for insulin. Also, yeah, doubt they would still have the caps if used for drugs lol."
"Where I live, drug addicts can exchange used needles for new ones. It doesn't stop them from using but at least they can do it without spreading disease. You can also get your drugs tested in the same place."
My thought was this too. Once I rented a flat where I found a ton of these under the sink.
"These are the same needles I use to give my patients their long acting insulin.  
Still, these need to go into a sharps container, being diabetic doesn’t mean they don’t have blood borne diseases."
I don't think I've ever seen a diabetic use a hypodermic needle like these. Insulin comes in auto-injectors now.

"Yes, though there are negative repercussions. Namely the needle gets dulled and does more damage to your skin/veigns opening you up to infection. There's a very Kool img out there showing the up close tip of a needle after one use, two uses, three, etc. By the end it doesn't look like something you'd want to jam into your body."
"You can reuse needles but it's not a great idea. Some people even use 2 needles; 1 to draw and 1 to inject.

Medical grade needles are incredibly sharp, but here's an image that does a good job showing why you wouldn't want to reuse them http://i.imgur.com/xK5g6.png

scale: http://i.imgur.com/LEr3o.jpg"
"Sure, would you re-use a bandaid though? 

Needles come sterile, after poking yourself and being exposed to the environment they are no longer sterile. Not a big deal if you're doing drugs, but if you're using them for medical purposes then they're cheap enough to be disposable and much less likely to cause infection."
"Insulin needles are the go to for street drugs.

Also, are you not given biohazard sharps containers for safe disposal by your doctor/pharmacy?"
"Hey, coming from a fellow diabetic. Get a syringe clipper off amazon. It clips the needle off so you can throw away the syringe without a needle. Holds about 1000 needles and when it’s full, you just lock it and toss the whole thing. Much safer and you can carry it with you. Plus they’re only about 6 dollars."

I think at this point it gave me everything. I think I've completed my bloodborne transmitted diseases Pokedex and I didn't even have to go to the Wild Area to do so.
At least we can cure hep c now.
"Those caps actually lock down and are attached to the syringe in many cases. I know this due to seeing them litter the street on my many, many walking tours of scenic Long Island."
But you can’t get flavored juul pods
Lol?
Wrong. Former heroin user. I capped all my needles before throwing them away. It’s called don’t be a dick.
"There are plenty of alley-ways, parking lots, and other public places with piles of capped and uncapped needles like this in Portland."

Trump's EPA don't even care if it's nuclear waste.
The tingling means its working.
Cdc says about 1 in 400 chance to get hiv from needle with hiv blood on it.... Not saying id take the money but you know just saying good odds
"So you need to show the cash up front then I'll get in really slowly then back out. If it kills me the money goes to my niece and nephew. Tell me the the time and place and I'll be there!

Seems like alot of caps on the needles and would take the risk if 2 Million went to them ;)"
Reminds me of the syringe pit in one of the Saw movies.

Hey earl
"Everett WA, too"
How about Braintree?
"I remember playing Everett in football my freshman year of high school. Them dudes got something different in their water. Or at least they did 15 years ago. I was like 150 lbs playing WR/OLB and some FB. Their defensive linemen were like 300+ lbs each. Pretty sure we lost like 35-6 or something

That has literally nothing to do with the picture, that’s just my only experience with Everett"
Don’t forget San Francisco

"To be fair, at this point in the US pretty much every state has a problem with addiction and usage given the opioid crisis we’re facing right now. Even New England (which a lot of people don’t suspect) has it very very bad in some areas. Seattle just happens to be the go to in media given their needle exchange programs and public attempts to actually solve the issue instead of just jailing people who need help."
I lived in downtown Portland for over a year and am proud to say I never saw any syringes laying around. Saw naked people all the time but that’s for another thread.
"HIV does not do well when exposed. You probably won't get it from this water. Needles are so dangerous because the blood that remains inside the hollow needle is in a protected environment. Also, this may be trashy but it is far better than leaving a syringe out in the street"
"Yes, thank god. My mom had hep c from getting a tattoo at someones home. Like not at a actual shop just a friend, and she was cured. The only way we could afford it is because she was in a study that helped determine if a few certain drugs worked. It was free just because she was a participant in the study. Thank god for science, and that my mom was able to be cured!"
"Yup, this. Been on plenty of walking tours in Atlanta and New Orleans. Almost never seen a cap missing other than in random small towns in the south east. And a few in Denver oddly enough."
Oof. That hits home.

"I think a big factor is how long until the needle was used. Many viruses die very quickly outside the body, but if you used a needle right after someone else the risk would go up sharply."
You can’t get HIV from dried blood.
(1/400)*(.5*(number of needles in bucket-needles in bucket you can see capped) =  your odds I think
I'd say that sounds like [a key in a pit of needles situation](https://youtu.be/3CAQ0iZKP08)
*has flashbacks to the needle pit in Saw 2 (or was it 3?)*
Saw II
"It's called ""mischief night"" here in nj/pa. And honestly it seems to barely exist anymore these days. 

That Camden fire thing has barely been a thing after that crazy year, 1991, where people lit like 100+ buildings on fire. I don't live in Camden so idk if it happens at all or not still, but nothing like that. 

But yeah I don't even see evidence of people even tp-ing or egging or anything really anymore in my area in nj. Was still a thing when I was a teen in the early-mid 2000s, but seemingly not anymore. It dying down is probably a result of two things, 1: police cracking down more(which they most definitely did in camden). And 2:Kids in general simply leave the house and hang out outside significantly less these days."
Pioneer Square or Everett came to my mind
I was thinking downtown seattle
My vote is Everett WA as well
Everett sucks.
"Ahh, Everett WA. I have a lifetime of stories and odd pictures (not of people) just from 3 years of working/living there. Sad to see an entire area engulfed by drugs. 

Moved to a small town in the mountain states. Couldn't be happier."
Yeah that can work
"If ya can’t beat ‘em, Sweet’ums!"
"Well yes I understand this, and I live in an entirely different part of the state affected by drug usage but more of the opiate side in terms of pills and prescription drugs.

I also go to the south and  see it in the papers there, and the comparrison is just startling, here you know people use drugs and we have an epidemic and a problem but its not as bad as it is elsewhere, its not as visualized, over there the papers are full of it, over here, not so much.

There are some horrible areas in Seattle, and my wifes family is from the Silverdale and Paulsbo area so we also do not see much of it when I'm over there given the general class that exist in those areas also.  But ride a ferry into Seattle and walk around vs walking around in New Orleans and its night and day,  NO is far far worse, yet talked about little."
Chowchilla Chowder
how many hometowns can one person have?
"Since we're being pedantic, one could say the HIV *is* the aids virus."
"Which is why he said the ""aids virus"", that is the virus that causes aids, not that aids is the virus."
You'd think so.
And that’s the way you do it
What’s in the box?!?
Step 5: Post on Reddit.
Step 5: Repeat
"One of my dads has HIV but his is controlled with medicine and such so when he goes to the doctor they can't even detect it. But he says that after 6 seconds exposed to air the virus dies. I drank after him and ate after him like thousands of times and never got it. He still took precautions though. Like say he was cooking in the kitchen and accidentally cut himself he would inform my other dad to not go in the kitchen, clean and bandage the cut, cover the cut with plastic and then clean wherever he may have bled with bleach.


Edit: Just want to point out that HIV has a lot of stigma against it. But when someone with HIV is having it treated and takes precautions it's very hard for other people to get it. Even if my dad hadn't had taken precautions it was still unlikely he was going to give anybody HIV. Even my other dad doesn't have HIV and they are married."
Hah..sharply..
"Yeah. HIV will die in a contaminated needle in a few days. Hep c is also a risk with dirty needles, and that can be a transmission risk for a few weeks. 

Source : former sexual health advisor, former junkie, currently working a job that involves picking up dirty needles most days. You'd think I'd have had enough by now."
That's the only thing in a Saw film that has ever made me feel uncomfortable.
It was indeed saw 2
Saw II was lit af.
"Holy. Shit!

I just read an article about that night in 1991 you mentioned. Holy absolute shit.... here's some excerpts

>A record 133 fire calls were sounded that hellish night in 1991 
>""It was widespread mayhem. There was no discernible pattern,""

>The city, filled with thousands of abandoned structures – most of the fires were set in empty buildings – had 165 firefighters on duty that night instead of the typical 40. 

>Moca Gonzales, pointed to a place on 5th Street, shaking his head. ""That's where the paddy wagon was. They kept loading in teens. They couldn't keep up.""

>With several shootings in the city during the fires, firefighters were wary.


>Drug dealers harassed firefighters responding to fires in North Camden. 
""residents were throwing rocks and bottles at firefighters as they tried to put out the fires.''

Lmao yeah I work in pioneer square. About right.
Good ol' USA
"Ok... all of yall are making me want to hear stories about this Everett place.

What's going on in this place that it's such a shithole???"
Oh I completely agree. I think part of it too plays into race and social class unfortunately. New Orleans is known for its bourbon street/voodoo whereas Seattle is known for its yuppies- ones going to get more coverage than the other despite the disproportionate difference is severity. It’s sad all around though. Our current system isn’t working and too many people are falling between the cracks and that doesn’t seem like it’s going to change any time soon.
Probably 3 at max
"I guess so, but HIV very rarely becomes AIDS these days anyway. (In the western world, anyway)"
"That’s not what he meant though, and I think you know that."
That’s a bingo
Step 5: !?!?Profit?!?!
It's my dick in a box
So uh.... no profit?
"HIV lives for more than six seconds outside the body. It's not long, but it's longer than six seconds."
HIV is not transmitted by saliva so eating or drinking after someone isn’t a risk unless their mouth is bleeding.
The risk shot up
">  currently working a job that involves picking up dirty needles most days.

You follow Phish?"
"Funny, I was thinking could be my city in the UK. I guess those 1mil needles are ubiquitous"
"You ever take the spooky underground tour of Pioneer Square?

I prefer the spooky above ground tour of Pioneer Square."
And you perfectly well know that he meant hiv yet you still went on to correct him.
You just say “bingo”
The larger profits have already been made. From here it’s just bread crumbs and then hit the system reset button.
Only because no one else would take a stab at it.
I don't really think phish has a opiate junky following... picking up nitrous balloons or something would be more on point lol.

One of Toby's best lines
"Gabe: No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. 

Holly: No, I don't think so. 

Gabe: Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior. 

Michael: Yes, it was that. It's that one. 

Holly: Yes. Number three."
"It's a tie between:

""We could all be gym teachers.""
""Actually, I can't.  I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.""

And. 

""Shut up about the sun!  SHUT UP ABOUT THE SUN!!"""
Skinny Toby gives me the chills.
"Gabe is EXTREMELY underrated. The more I watch, the more I like him."
Gabe was the best addition to the original cast after Andy
"Oh, get out skeleton man."
Walk away bitch
Ciao
I actually think Toby is a fairly funny character and this is probably my favorite scene with him.
Gabe wad...
"Hey, watch it"
Shut up about the sun SHUT UP ABOUT THE SUN!
Lmao I love this scene
I love Gabe
 This guy fucks.
Perfect
"The way Gabe says ""Hey, watch it"" right after Toby's line always gets me too.  
  
 Zach Woods is such a good actor. He is amazing as Jared in Silicon Valley too."
"""They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!"""
Oh Val
"Well, I mean, who else's name do you think she should scream? Not fucking yours Toby!"
"""Uh I have to go back to my stick insect exhibit at the zoo now."""
That is so Toby
ODOYLE RULES
Great now I'm paranoid he's the strangler again.
Mine is where he gets to play Lincoln
This guy fucks
I'd say my favorite Gabe scene was when he comes into the conference room with a cupcake like itsss my birthdayyy and everyone's like EW GET OUT and he just walks away frowning
I don’t get it
Gabe is definitely one of my favorite characters. He's so fucking weird. I love that goddamn skeleton man.

toby looks like tony hawk if he chose slide rule instead of FS boardslide
i couldn’t stand Gabe.
“Walk away bitch”
But he does have a point
This is top 3 underrated scenes of the series for me. Each character delivers every part of it so well.

"The writers were most unfair and unjust to Toby. He really was a such a neutral, innocent, and likable character but they did him dirty and wrote some shitty shit."
My favorite Gabe scenes are the one's without him.
O'Doyle Rules! O'Doyle Rules!
#sweet home Alabama
Toby’s such a creep
DOES ANYONE HAVE A CAMERA HERE?
It’s from the confidence he gets from only being the second most pathetic person in the room.
“HEY ASSHOLE! You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?”
I think Toby's best line was in a blooper real from I don't know what season. 2-4 maybe?  In the scene Michael is disgusted by the sight of Toby wearing a bowtie. Explaining it doesn't do it justice.
It’s just such a solid show!
"If there's any young people here, be prepared for that number 3. It's real and it sucks."
What episode is this?
I say “shut up about the sun” whenever someone talks too much about a certain subject. It’s my favorite line ever
"The actor who plays Gabe was on Ellen and he talked about how he once went to a Gym he read about which ended up being just this dudes garage and how he was shocked to learn he couldn’t bench press any weight like, *at all*. The instructor guy took the weights off and then he couldn’t lift the bar itself, he took the bar and just practiced the “form” of imaginary weight lifting, and he said he seriously got tired. He makes fun of himself in his characters and on live tv, it’s super endearing. I love him in every role I see him in hahaha"
"I love the scene where everyone is waiting and suddenly gabe comes in with a cupcake and says ""happy birthday to gabe!"""
Shut up about the sun!! has my vote. Gabe's such an underrated character.
"I laughed so hard at ""shut up about the sun"" and his face getting out of the room, hiding he was crying. Gabe is hilarious."
"I can't get over just how scrunched up his face was during that scene. Like suddenly, there's more empty space in his face."
"Therapist: Skinny Toby isn’t real, he can’t hurt you 

Skinny Toby:"
There was a fat Toby?
"""Erin doesn't even like sex. Remember, you said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton."""
"Yea I don’t understand the Gabe hate, he’s my favorite"
"The guy who plays him is my absolute favourite character in Silicon Valley. He's just doing a Gabe sort of character again but it's even better. He gets all the best lines and has that unique way of delivering it that only he can do. And in that show he fucks, that guy really fucks, its confirmed. If you watch the show you'll get that reference..."
Zach Woods is just so fucking great
"I have that ""he's such an unlikeable character,  but he's *my* unlikeable character"" feeling for him."
I'm glad he found work in silicon valley after the documentary.
Ehhh I’d put Andy somewhere lower. I mean he’s great but gave really does it for me
"Eh, I give that honor to Robert Califonia myself, he really grew on me in subsequent rewatches. Gabe's up there though for sure."
"Honestly I fucking love Clark.  I know there is a fair amount of hate around season 9, but Clark's role kills me.  Some of his scenes leave me in tears with his delivery.  Some of his glances and one liners just make me bust up"
Season 9 Andy makes me want to fast forward past him to the parts of the episodes I actually enjoy.
"He's a show stealer in Silicon Valley, and the cast of that show is solid af."
I think he goes by Drew now.
"I’d give that to Robert California, and I’d say Nelly is a close 3rd after Gabe."
Plop?

Why?
That line epitomizes his character
*I'm just gonna hop the fence and run home*

Smile if you like men's prostates!
*This* is the best Toby line.
That subplot is so underrated.
"This is my favorite line from Toby:

>**Erin:** I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.

>*[Cut to aside with Toby]*

>**Toby:** If we don't patronize the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas... and... you know... make your own salads. \*eye twitch\*

Or

“This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest, scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from his female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.”"
"That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong. And my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight."
I’ve literally never been in a situation that did not have an applicable and profound office quote to reference
What age are we talking about here cause my friend is 32 and is wondering.
"Jokes on you, neither my girlfriend nor I have ever had a sex life

Edit: on the one hand this is a self-deprecating joke (and we do kinda have a sex life occasionally), but actually we are three years into our life together and very happy, and the fact that neither of us has much of a sex drive is comforting in that we don't have to worry if that part of our relationship goes away"
At what age does it happen?
Idk sounds like some wild times
"""nobody tell him"""
Ok Gabe
"[This is that interview!](https://youtu.be/nJq_7PIiFk0) Zach Woods is hilarious and such a sweetheart, I’m a little bit in love with him."

"It's not so much of an age thing as it's made out to be. It's just that as people get older, their health is more likely to be in decline.

Mental health is a major cause of issues with sex drive/satisfaction/difficulty achieving orgasm. Particularly body image issues.

[Causes of erectile dysfunction are obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/symptoms-causes/syc-20355776)

Medications also can cause less intense orgasms, more difficulty orgasming, etc. I take an SSRI and it makes it harder for me to orgasm and I can't do it as frequently as I could before.

Basically, if you get the mental help you need when you need it, eat decently and stay somewhat in shape you are far less likely to run into issues :)"
At whichever age it happens.

"Plus, he got some really long limbs so I'd imagine it'd be even tougher for him."
Not here
"I think it's because they used him sparingly so he never got old, a lot of the main characters get so much screen time they essentially became parodies of themselves as the show got into the later seasons. It's like Creed, pretty much every time he had a line in an episode it was one of, if not *the* funniest line there. Less is more with that type of comedy."

"OK but ngl though, as a Chinese, I have to agree with him - sort of. The Chinese food served at chain restaurants are exactly what he said. Panda express comes to mind. It's goopy and way too oily and salty. It tastes like what a stereotypical American would think Asian foods should be like.

Actual authentic Chinese food is nowhere like that."
Shitty Chinese food is gloopy and over-salted but good Chinese food is fucking sick
"To be fair the fast food variants are just rice, vegetables and meat soaked in grease with ""spices"" on top."
He thinks mayonnaise is albino hot sauce.
old mate had clearly never had some wonton soup or BBQ pork because that stuff is delish
"Tbf he's not wrong, I assume he's talking about Americanized Chinese food, which isn't the most flavorful of foods. It pales in comparison to other Americanized Asian foods, like Japanese or Thai food."
Bananas are spicy to me! Cuz I'm allergic!
 I didn’t know the Heatmiser had a twitter. Hot Cheeto lookin ass.
Said the guy who puts food in his hair.
The slang sassy attitude is so overused on Twitter...

[LOL I thought I was going crazy for a second. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/e11b5n/apparently_thinking_two_cuisines_are_nasty_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Sounds like someone whose idea of an adventurous meal choice is panda express
Imagine lumping *all* Chinese food like this
He's right tho
Lmao now that's a good one!
"This dude has been to PF Changs and Panda Express, he has no idea the potential of real Chinese food."
"No, it's just that the only chinese food you've ever had is Panda Express."
"Terry Moran here has definitely tried so much different food from the huge nation of China to think it is all gloppy, tired and boring."
He's right though
He S U C C the S P I C Y banana
m a y o n a i s e   i s   s p i c y
"I mean I don't particularly like 'typical' Chinese food that you order at any old Chinese restaurant, except hot and sour soup. What I like is Sichuan Chinese food, because the flavours seem a lot more complex and powerful, and it's spicy too. Yummmm"
"I remember Woody Allen saying, (and I paraphrase):

> When people say they don't like Woody Allen films it's like saying they don't like Chinese food. There are 700 different national dishes in China, how can you say you don't like Chinese food."
"I agree with Terry somewhat, but specifically for takeaway Chinese food. A lot of that is just sloppy, oily garbage

It's like saying ""I hate American food"" because you don't like McDonald's. Make the stuff yourself and it tastes 110% better"
"I mean I I'd say as someone who grey up with indian-chinese food, that the stuff that's usually served at a lot of western Chinese restaurants is overly early and simplistic in taste?"
Terry Moran is in Washington DC where the Chinese food sort of sucks so he's half correct here.
What a moran
That's gold coming from that ginger nightmare.
ngl it is kinda gloopy
"Well idk what gloppy is, it's definitely not boring but I'd probably lean towards agreement on there being too much salt. Might just be the takeaways near me tho."
I don't think that actual Chinese food is the same as takeaway.
"Well depends, IMO the food from Northern part of China are shits but the southern part are God tier."
American's literally take a lump of meat and heat it up.
"My wife used to say the same shit about Mexican food. I used to try to reason with her, and tell her that true Mexican food wasn't like anything she had ever eaten, and she'd do that ""I don't care what you say"" thing. Then I found the ultimate way to win that argument. She's Japanese, you see, and quite elitist when it comes to Japanese food. So I ask her one day, ""How does Japanese food in this country compare to authentic Japanese food?"" She says most of it is junk, and the very best is mediocre in comparison. And that's how I got my wife to go to Taco Bell."
To be fair he could be comparing to to other Asian foods.
This is hardly a rare insult is it? White people can't handle spicy food is a pretty easy one.
And that's coming from a man who looks like his  sriracha flavored kilt tastes good with his polyamory
He’s not wrong about.
"Gotta love people going around insulting people literally replying to ""post your most controversial opinion on x"" threads. Some people just *want* to get mad."
"Terry moran has clearly never tasted real chinese food. Probably is talking about western “chinese food”, like panda express and shit"
"I mean I don't really get why the guy is getting so defensive, it is a controversial food opinion after all, like that was the whole point"
This is a lazy ass lame insult and that dude is the last person to be talking about other people's looks
I agree with the over salted part. I like the Japanese and Italian style of adding a little salt and then letting the person eating salt the rest to taste
Ok just because the country's government is oppressive authoritarian fuckweed doesn't mean we need to take it out on the food
I bet he thinks Panda Express is Chinese food.
">utterly forgettable 

He seems to have a strong opinion of something he’d forget about"
"Chinese IS shit.

It IS gloopy and mushy and gross. When I moved to Newcastle 10 years ago people used to talk about how this or that Chinese place was great an dit was always the same of mushy gross shit.

Thai is where it's been at for me for the last 30 years."
Chinese food is over salted? As opposed to McDonald's French Fries? They literally dump salt on them.
Remember racism is okay and funny as long as it's towards white people.
"Along with being pretty unoriginal, that was totally uncalled for."
"That post really brought the crazy racists out. My favorite was the guy who said all Indian food is bad and ""we"" just pretend it isn't."
He’s right though
Ru Fire Star of David Rose has a good point.
What sort of Chinese food is he eating such that it's oversalted?
I don’t meant to be *that* guy but isn’t banana a spice?
"chinese food is spicier than a banana and hes calling it bland
So her insult actually makes no sense"
"I have had two Chinese step moms, went to school with a bunch of Chinese immigrants, and work with a bunch of Chinese immigrants.

Their food is awful. Ive been to a few authentic Chinese New Year meals at peoples houses. I try so hard to like it but... nope."
Am I missing something? Dude didn’t even say Chinese food was spicy...
"I mean,he was asked for a controversial opinion and he gave a controversial opinion,irk what the dude on the bottom got offended about,its still just an opinion,if he doesnt like chinese food then who cares,thats his thing"
"Chinese food is pretty god damn oily, to be fair."
"He's right though. I'm sure it's different in actual China, but I'm not game to go and try it."
Ok Boomer.
I think he's got a point. It's only really become interesting since they started throwing chili at everything. Indian food is far superior.
I LOVE RACISM!
Is it kind of weird for a jewish guy to make white jokes when they identify as non-white?
He probably thinks mayonnaise is spicy.
"It's been a shit show honestly, dude here is getting ratioed hard and there was that other guy that didn't like Indian food and everyone dogpiled him like he executed a baby on live TV, its been pretty ridiculous but 'tis the nature of Twitter I guess."
That tweet created a shitstorm on Twitter. Now people are being called racist for not liking a certain type by mobs made out of tens of thousands of people.
And if he’s eating Americanized Chinese he’s right.  I had Chinese food in Colorado once and it was the most underwhelming meal I ever had.
To be fair he is almost definitely talking about PF Changs and not actual Chinese food
Yeah all he did was answer the question. Although I disagree and feel this guy has probably never had good Chinese food.
don't kinkshame.
"> edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger

I know I'm just grumpy because it's early, but I just wanted to say I immediately downvote any comment that includes this fucking line. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk."
Ever used a banana skin as a wankaid? It's very a-peeling.
How the hell do you use your bananas ??
r/AwardSpeechEdits why is it always the good ones
If food is so spicy that you are only tasting heat than I think its reasonable to call it bland and boring
"They just mocking him for being an old white guy, it doesn't make sense at all"
Yeah but the guy with the red hair had to make a statement about how quirky and not-white-old-man he is.
He’s probably eating Americanized Chinese food which is completely unforgettable (looking at you Panda Express)
"This guy has probably never eaten actual Chinese food in his life. What fucking Chinese food is ""gloppy."""
He didn't call it bland though. He said it was over-salted.
Get that potassium coming out you ass-sium.
"It's right up here with ""can't dance"" and ""karen"" in the white joke hierarchy."
"I never got this. I know that white people don't usually use as many seasonings for food just because of cultural backgrounds of food, but in America spicy food is insanely popular. You can't tell me white people don't *inhale* buffalo wings."
Those people have clearly never met any Cajuns. They put hot sauce and Tony’s on everything.
I think the choice on non spicy food is what works here.
"Hottest chilli in the world was grown in a town in rural England, for about a month until it was dethroned."
That's really white of you - if you consider Chinese food to be spicy..  [Source; I'm about as pink as a mouse dink.]
"Ohhh yea, we all know when you want spicy adventurous foods you go Chinese. What is everyone smoking in this thread..."
"Thems shits aint spicy but god damn they make my abdomen feel like it's suddenly decided that the current positions of my organs just isn't good enough and my large intestines should promptly leave my body.

Don't know why, i was able to eat banana's perfectly fine for the first 15 years of my life, but then the moment i want to pretend like i'm sucking some banana dick i feel like my organs suddenly wonder what it'd be like to be on the other side of my skin. Worst part is the first time it happened i hadn't even realized it was the banana that made me sick, so it had to happen again for me to learn my lesson."
Top comment material right here
And you look like you stuck one up your shit tunnel
My condolences.
So... the internet in a nutshell???
It’s still a unique comeback.  This isn’t a sub for determining who was morally right.  It’s about who string together a creative new insult.
Oh god why did you have to remind me he still exists
"Hello this is Chris Hansen from to catch a predator, why don’t you have a seat over there?"
Do you think he’s talking about the fast food or authentic?
What Chinese food you been eating? Anglocised Chinese food is pretty derivative. If you get a chance to somewhere with a high Chinese population. Especially from Szechuan province. You'll find plenty to eat with amazing flavours
"If that's what you think, I'd be willing to bet you've only had low quality American Chinese food. Find a good restaurant selling authentic Chinese, and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Chinese food is trash. Tiny amount of spice on top of unseasoned, BOILED meat and bland gravy. Nah, no thanks."
"...Uhm, juuuust putting it out there, not sure they're supposed to burn. I believe that might be what those fancy book-learnin' doctor-types call an 'allergy' or 'OAS' if they're really swingin' that doc-dick around."
"Don't have to be mad to make a goofy quip.

You're right nonetheless--some people just *want* to get mad."
It’s a white person making another joke to a white person? Hardly racist mate.
Yup.
Saltines are my favorite crackers.
r/yourjokebutworse
Ohhh good one!!!
If you're on twitter you should expect to be shat on 24/7. That's all the platform is for.
Kinkshaming is my kink.
"But insulting someone’s food preferences using racism is ok. White = no spice, vanilla only."
i mean he's shaming someone for having a controversial opinion on a... controversial food opinion thread
Don't food taste shame.
"it's ironic, but I salute your honesty and sarcasm"
and I'm downvoting you to abide by your rules
You seem like the type of guy who makes jokes at a funeral....
"Do you eat the banana before, during, or save it as a recuperative treat afterwards?"
You don't wanna know
its ironic
Or the takeaway near him is just shit
"I've tastes pretty much the entire menu and yeah, it's bland and boring. Real chinese food is really good (not my favourite in the world, but eh, personal tastes), but junk western ""chinese"" food isn't that great.

Even from the best restaurants. It has a cap on how good it can get, and that cap is really low."
"Yeah. Fried rice or orange chicken too. My only complaint about Chinese food is that Sichuan peppercorns give me a very special kind of heartburn, and I have eaten a lot of habaneros in my life but those things are a whole different game."
Ok boomer
"You gotta build up your tolerance to where extremely spicy things are no longer spicy, I have learned over the years that there are a lot of peppers that will add a ton of amazing flavor, habaneros for example but if you cant handle super spicy food, it just taste like spice."
"""Karen"" transcends gender, culture, ideology, skin color and so on."
"Karen isn't a skin color, it's a lifestyle"
Don't forget that white guys can't jump. Wait..
"It might have to do with the fact that it's much easier to notice a white person getting flush. The darker the skin, the more extreme it has to be before it's noticeable. 

Also, though spicy food is pretty popular here, it's pretty rare that we go to the extremes that are considered normal in some parts of Asia."
"Plus, all the chili-huffing lunatics are always white."
White AMERICAN people. White Europeans use seasonings quite a lot. They conquered a lot of the planet just for spices.
We mainly use salt and black pepper here in Norway.
People who aren’t from here have stereotypes just like we have stereotypes about them. Chinese men have small penises and men from the Mandinka tribes steal TVs. Don’t get butthurt about it.
The difference is that most white people don’t eat spicy food on a daily basis. Most Indians and Chinese (real sezchuan food not the fake American Chinese shit) eat incredibly spicy food for almost every meal.
Buffalo wings aren't even that spicy if you ask people who eat spicy food part of their culture
"Depends on what kind of white. Southern white? Texan? Yeah, all about the spice.

Iowan? Yeah, they boil chicken up there"
"Look I love white people food, but buffalo wings are not spicy like ethnic foods are spicy. 

The biggest difference I can really think of is that North Americans use hot sauce as a condiment, whereas a lot of other cultures use spice in the actual cooking process which adds a whole other layer of spice game."
"I don't know, I had Atomic buffalo wings from an American brand in Singapore, and we were like that's not even hot, let alone atomic.   


I am willing to write it down as subdued spice levels, but i can't keep thinking that the place was singapore, whose famous dish chilli crab is like punch to the throat levels spicy if done right"
"Imagine thinking that Tony's, Tabasco, Crystal, or Louisiana are actually spicy."
Those aren't spicy to people who eat spicy food
Still not rare at all. There's the common joke/insult that mayonnaise is too spicy for white people.
Allergic reactions evolve and often worsen over time.
"Yeah but that subreddit is just ""I'm right leaning and want affirmation from other likeminded people"""
"It’s not really that unique. 

“You don’t like spicy food”"
"It's not unique in the slightest. I have been hearing variations of ""white people can't handle spicy food"" for years.

Plus it is a bad insult to choose in this situation. He was complaining that chinese food is bland, one way to make food not bland is spices."
You could replace the words ‘Chinese food’ with ‘that comeback’ and the tweet would honestly work a lot better. This comeback has been beat into the ground for like 4 years straight with the only difference being changing the food slightly every time.
"But its not even that creative,we have all heard of the stereotype that white people cant handle spicy food"
CHEESE IT!
"I assumed he was talking about the fast food kind. It seems like a fair opinion if you’re a foodie and like authentic. I, for one, love the fast food stuff as long as it’s fresh"
"Most Americans' only experience with Chinese food *is* fast food, so it makes a lot of sense why that's what they think Chinese food is like."
"Yeah, I know... But it's twitter. Most people on there seem to be angry."
Because you can't hate your own race?
"This is 100% not just an american thing, its a twitter thing

Source: currently living in france."
DAE Hate the best country in the world?
America has always been a stupid place that accidentally produces a few smart people
Do you ever kinkshame yourself for pleasure?
"Well shit I’m not sure whether to lynch you for bigotry or to applaud you for being so brave and tolerate your kink shaming kink.....


I’ll get back to ya once I unravel this web of confusion"
"It's gotta be consensual, babe."
This comeback makes no sense because you can only do that with consent. Otherwise you're still just an asshole
During..gotta keep the stamina up
"Nah. Thai and Vietnamese food make my tongue and microbiome symbiotically happy. The only Chinese food I've eaten in a long time was dim sum, which is pretty interesting, but often bland - so yeah, the opposite of a banana is too spicy."
Or it's a 7 eleven
This doesn't even work here. You can't just say it whenever.
This would've been a perfect ok millennial moment but you botched it.
Ok idiot
But some spicy food just simply is hot for the sake of being hot and has very little flavor. Ex. Buffalo Wild Wings.
Or you could just eat less spicy food that still has a ton of flavour and not spend a lot of time with your mouth on fire just so you can enjoy a couple of extra dishes.
That's actually been scientifically proven.
But we're real good at blowing shit up literally and figuratively. It's 3:30AM and I'm blowing up this fuckin toilet for instance.
"Also, when you eat a lot of spicy food, like many asians do, you burn some of your food receptors, so the food doesn't feel as spicy to you anymore."
Because white people didn't used hot spices to konserve food (capsaicin conserves to a degree) but rather salt and vinegar. Food in Europe is often extremely salty/pickled.
"Aye, we love those spices so much that we didn't even ask nicely. And opiates, we loveeeee opiates too."
Where exactly do you think a majority of white Americans descend from?
"I am kind of confused by this as where I live there is about 8 mexican places within a mile radius, 4 of which sell some extremely spicy food.

Then there is about 2 indian places within a mile near me. Plenty of white americans eat spicy food, and its kind of dumb to assune. Actually I lived in france for a while and I was craving spicy food there the whole time as literally nowhere sold anything spicy other then some very mild chinese style hot sauces, and I eat spicy food for literally almost every single meal."
"> White Europeans use seasonings quite a lot. 

Spain would beg to differ."
">	They conquered a lot of the planet just for spices.

Uh yea, like fucking black pepper and cinnamon. I know for sure when I think of traditional Dutch cuisine I think, “wow those smoked eels and soused herring sure look spicy! You can really tell they controlled the *spice* islands!”"
"But that’s because our country has basically just been introduced to them spicy bois, back in the day, just having salt for your food was a luxury. Pepper was even harder to come by for the regular Ola Nordmann."
what the fuck is white people food? i’m white please enlighten me
"The Buffalo part describes a specific flavor of sauce which is a mixture of butter and frank red hot sauce, which is more of a mild-weak hot sauce that is predominantly vinegar in flavor. So it's pretty low (to me I taste no spice) on the spice level.

The atomic part is someone adding more spice to the Buffalo flavor."
Of those you mentioned I only known Tabasco (I‘m German) and you‘d say it‘s not spicy at all?
And r/politics is the same for left leaning people. Most people use reddit to reinforce their believes not to challenge them.
"Yes and the insult doesn't even make sense. If he had said: ""Chinese food burns my mouth"" then maybe it had something to do with it. But instead he says ""it tastes really bland"". RESPONSE: ""you think even a super bland food is spicy""."
Clever wording can be classified as unique. Do you want him to make up brand new words or something?
I'm not sure you understand how quotation marks work.
">“You don’t like spicy food”

It's not what was the base form of what was said that's important, but that it was said creatively. 

Your quote is like

>""I'm drunk, you're ugly"" - Winston Churchill 

It doesn't sound good when you're boiling it down to its essence, does it?"
"I moved from Hawaii (where some Chinese people will open a restaurant before learning English) to Portland.  I have yet to find a place that isn’t over salted, oily, and (comparatively) poor in flavor.  Then I visited my brother in Colorado and the local Chinese food barely had any of the original spices.

What I’m trying to say is he may be right.  Real Chinese food is amazing, but only if it’s real Chinese food.  If it’s the watered down, fortune cookie giving, over salted place that’s name starts with “Lucky”, his description is perfect.  And if that’s all that’s available in his city, how is he supposed to know any different?"
Yeah I agree also. After a while all the greasy flavors just blend together and it’s just blegh.
What’s racist about this tweet mate?

"Yeah that is true, but generally I stick to the flavorful spicy food. Although there was one spicy hot wings I had at buffalo wild wings, I actually think it might have been the habenero funnily enough, it was like blueberry habanero or something weird like that."
"The point is some of those peppers have such great flavors that you cant really get from anything else. I eat spicy food with pretty much every meal because most of the things that add the spice have amazing flavor.
A lot of people I know who dislike spice agree with what you are saying that spicy food makes you not taste the flavor. But you are really missing out on some amazing meals."
"If you're used to it, your mouth isn't on fire.

It really can add a lot to a meal if you give it a shot. If you adapt yourself a little, it doesn't set your mouth on fire at all, and adds a lot of complexity by opening your tastebuds. It just has to do with your tolerance."
"It's a reference to a film. Good film, I recommend it"

"I think we hold the title, but you gotta highly commend the middle East for their efforts."
Nah the point of the opium war was that the Chinese loved opiates too much. Also most imperialism in Asia happened on top of existing power structures so asking nicely was very much part of the game plan. Not everywhere is America.
Do spices get passed on through genes now?
...what?
"The salt and pepper generations are dying out. Go to any restaurant in a 'big' Norwegian city. It's not the immigrants running the restaurants that are eating the spicy shit, it's young Norwegians. The whitest kid in the kebab queue will always order the most spicy shit."
You ever been to a Denny's
Casseroles
"As a person who likes spicy food, it's definitely spicy but not unbearably so? People talking about spicy stuff are weird. 

There's like a weird machismo in talking about it where people feel the need to say things like ""HAHA, HABENERO PEPPERS? LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT GHOST PEPPERS"" and then one up each other from there until someone sprays pepper spray in their mouth to flex on people who weren't raised in households where Dad wouldn't eat anything unless it had half a bottle of Cholula on it and an Indian guy to punch him in the mouth after."
"Regular Tabasco is basically the lower threshold of spice. It’s hot enough to let you know it has some spice, but not enough that you will suffer from it. The other sauces mentioned are slightly less spicy than Tabasco. Tony Chachere’s is a creole spice mixture that’s kind of like seasoning salt with red pepper flakes and chili powder. They’re all about as spicy as putting a bunch of black pepper on something, but that’s really basic on heat scales. Check out the YouTube series Hot Ones if you want to see some real heat. It’s celebrities being interviewed while eating progressively hotter wings. Tabasco is about as hot as their starter sauce."
Nope.
If you don’t eat a lot of spicy stuff sure it’s spicy. But on the scale of spicy things it’s pretty low. It’s not even as spicy as a habanero.
"Tabasco is, but I’m not a fan of Louisiana or Crystal. They just taste like vinegar and ketchup. Tabasco ages the peppers in ex-bourbon barrels and it really amps up the depth of flavor."

You repeating it doesn't make it suddenly make sense. Also the 92 in my username isn't my age so it would make even less sense to comment this when you inevitably do
Stop shitposting.
"For me it's the effort of eating spicy food to build up tolerance, I can't be bothered when there's other food available that I enjoy as opposed to eating something I enjoy less for the sake of building tolerance."
"It's the getting used to it part that I don't want to do, too much effort when there's other food to eat that's more enjoyable without getting used to spice."
No but cultures get passed on.
"Most Spanish cuisine doesn't use a lot of spices, especially not things that we tend to think of as ""spicy"" in the West."
"It's a European country with lots of white people, thus relevant to the comment I replied to, and their food tends to be some of the best in Europe -- not sure what's confusing about that.  I'm also very familiar with their cuisine after living there, so that was the first example that came to mind."
The spiciest options in Norwegian kebab shops aren’t even spicy tho.
no what is denny’s
prolly have had this once. it’s american right?
"I think everyone's tolerance to spicy food is different, especially depending on their exposure to regularly spicy foods.

In my experience, Frank's, tobasco, cholula don't feel spicy. No matter how much I put on my food, I just get overwhelmingly salty and vinegar flavors with hints of different earthy flavors from the Chiles.

That's not to say others don't taste spice when they eat it. Some people just don't."
"By replying you're giving them what they want. There isn't a response in the world they won't reply ""ok boomer"" to."

"I mean, I’d scream too if you got teeth falling out like Jaws and shit."
"If you don't get fired on the spot, you won't be when you clock out.

Edit: you may if you tweet about it."
"Funny story here. Was seventeen at the MVD, yes that is what is it called, in New Mexico. It's been two hours and I'm sitting in a chair watching Angels in the Outfield on their tv. Then there's this sound like a dish or something hits the ground. A clack.

I turn to see, can't see the floor, and there is this guy who looks mortified as an obese lady in a moo moo is walking out. He's looking at the floor then to the lady.

""Ma'am! Ma'am!"" He yells. She keeps walking. He looks desperate. I'm thinking what the fuck is happening? ""Ma'am! Your teeth!""

The lady stops in her tracks and turns around. She is obviously embarrassed as she picks up her teeth and waddles out of there. To this day I wonder if her teeth fell out of her purse or her mouth. She had to have her picture taken that day and was talking to the staff so why keep them in the purse?"
"Manager: ""Rock out before you clock out""

Her: ""Venture out before yo Dentures out"""
That's a fair reaction. Manager gotta chill if he thinking about disciplining her or whatever.
"Better than I would do tbh, no way I could hold my laughter after seeing some shit like that"
So I'm the only whose grandma had dentures around here?
"I'm sorry to be a fun killer but if those were his dentures, this person probably made this dude feel like shit.

I mean, I get the reaction if she didn't know they were dentures, but imagine how this dude feels."
Looks like her boss bungled the [Ron Swanson tooth prank.](https://youtu.be/N6J_32cDk9Y)
That is a completely reasonable reaction.
"“Who job hiring...”

As opposed to a different type of hiring?"
"Depending on why they fell out, might be worth it to go ahead and get a new job anyway."
Seems like an expected reaction to something so jaw dropping.
I believe you're supposed to hand the teeth back to the guy so he can give you HM04
Can't write properly but is employed???
Perhaps he just wants to  talk about the fact that you are borderline illiterate !
The picture of this girl is different than the one I saw on Twitter. I always wondered why there was always a cute chick. Now I know it’s fake.
who grammar cuz this post be giving headache
Body parts are strange. Teeth fall out and you freak out YOU gotta talk to the manager. Dick fall out and you freak out and HE has to talk to the manager. Dick fall out into your mouth and you get a corner office and Epstein still didn't kill himself.
I’m confused as to why that necessitates a new job or even a talk
no on that likes comas
"Obvisously dentures. Shit happens, adhesive wears off. Automatically, anybody should realize this and not be so damn extra.. It is obviously already embarrassing."
I was talking to a coworker one time whose bridge fell out mid conversation... I recoiled a little bit but I  was fine till i noticed a little spittle got on my face and then I wanted to throw some hands.

Fix your grammar before you apply for a new job.
Who job speak English?
Twitter user should learn grammar
Maybe learn to speak English.
She's talking about dentures people
"Me:”LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO”

Me: “Ight. Ima head out”"
What is it like working for Rudy Giuliani?
Hey we need you to live
"“Excuse me, sir, your teeth appear to have fallen onto my desk”

How else you gonna react to that shit? I’m at least laughing."
The manager clearly wants to tell her what they went through and probably ask for some privacy about what happened.
I’m just picturing that scene in Beetlejuice and laughing my ass off.
Dental Deficit Disorder is a growing problem in America.
Deez nuts!
I need an update to this
I’m sitting here trying to imagine literally screaming due to something like that
Fired over this ? Shitty country
The kind of job where you don't even have to be able to speak your own language properly will probably be automated away soon.
I remember when I was 6 my grandpa's fake teeth fell out and I laughed.
"I get why youd get in trouble for that.if you did that to a customer, Itd be extremely inappropriate and unprofessional."
why don’t black americans know how to speak english. That grammar gave me cancer
"""Who job hiring"". Nice."
Holy shit this is so me
"Well if he does fire you, tell him ""Bite me."""
[removed]
Dwrcl! Thanks for this
"Right? Totally normal reaction. Keep your job, sis."
Duh duhh
Checking Geiger counter.....
Especially when denture glue exists. No excuse
"Her manager had dentures and she did not know this before witnessing them falling out of his mouth.  Her initial reaction to seeing this was extreme fear, which disturbed the mood of her workplace.  She believes she is about to be fired over this event, or is perhaps so embarrassed that she would rather find another place of employment."
One cafe I worked at the owner fired his closing barista before the end of her shift. She left and he had his plans ruined because he had a 3 hour shift to close on his own. Then he found out that she wasn’t stealing after all.
not quite true. a lot of places I’ve worked at (mainly fast food) will let someone finish their shift to get their final hours/tips in their pocket. that’s if it wasn’t like a violent reason or like theft or contamination or something
I got fired the weekend the Sunday after Black Friday. They'll squeeze the last drops out of you.
This is not true!
">fired on the spot

Good ol' USA. *Land of the free*."
You could try *not screaming*
I think “screamed” and “made a scene” are two separate actions.
you can be normal and not overreact?
Laugh your ass off because your managers teeth just fell out.
You definitely can’t act like you didn’t see it.
"""ok mushmouth"""
"You take the fallen teeth, tell your manager that the tooth fairies are bringing a big fat promotion."
Because sometimes they hurt so bad that it's torture having them in or you can't eat with them in because they impact on the bone spurs or they are choking you or nauseous and do NOT want to throw up with them in or lose them in the toilet if you puke. Getting old is hell.
Did she stuff them back in her mouth after picking them up from the ground?
I’m fuckin dead this has me cracking up
">That's a fair reaction.

For a 4 year old.

What grown adult hasn't heard of dentures?"
"I'd just have a laugh about it if it were me, no reason to make a big deal out of the situation"

Dude what?
"I think maybe this one needed just a couple more minutes to bake before serving, chief."
My brain hurts
Manager is a brand of dentures maybe? I still don’t get how her dentures fell out of someone else’s mouth though.
"I think it's just supposed to be ""whose job is hiring..."""
No.
"Shes probably a teenage girl fresh out in the world. I've seen such girls screaming as they Jay walk, completely immature and clueless."
Is anyone hiring? I may be in need of a job soon as I screamed and made a scene when my manager’s teeth fell out; now we have to talk about it before I leave work.
You can’t read?
I guess her boss has dentures and she embarrassed him by getting scared when they fell out so now she's worried she has to find a new job
Bet you enjoy r/scottishpeopletwitter though
Maybe try to look for one with better healthcare or at least promotion prospects if your managers teeth won't stay in his gob.
Okay now explain Harry Potter
Telephone voice 11/10
"For a lot of people, having dentures is kind of embarrassing, and it can be especially humiliating to draw attention to it when they're standing there holding teeth."
Can you explain Interstellar please.
Thank you
"Lmao, they called my younger brother in, just to fire him at the start of the day, but he still had to finish his shift"
"The one time I got fired, they new ahead of time they were terminating me. Proceeded to work me to death for the pay period. Ended up working about 110 hours over 2 weeks with about 20 hours of callback pay. Claimed they were doing me a favor."
Oh ok let’s see You try to handle the situation normally next time someone’s teeth fall out
You could try *keeping your teeth in your mouth*
“Made a scene by screaming” might be what is meant
"Are we talking, like, *dentures?* Maybe a bridge? Or like this motherfuckers god-given *teeth falling out of his fucking skull?*

I’ve seen a bridge slip out, that’s fine... but we need more information"
"Might not be a horror movie type scream. Could just be a sudden, brief, loud yelp of surprise.

I once encountered someone who seemed to be a burn victim at a mall, with a face that, frankly, looked like melted plastic. I shrieked with shock because it was so sudden and I was so scared, and I absolutely felt horrible afterwards. If I had control over that, you bet I would not have said a word.

By the time I realized what was going on, she was already gone (like I said, it was in a pretty crowded mall). I don’t know whether there would have been a point in apologizing, since this was in a foreign country, and doing so might have just drawn even more attention and all for nothing if she didn’t speak English.

But sometimes this sort of thing just comes out without you meaning to."

"If I was the manager, I'd be making your life a living hell until you quit and then I'd laugh you out the door."
I thought they were made to fit. That's not the same as comfortable. I now realize this. My mama loves her dentures and the only time my gramma ever complained about hers was when the new puppies got ahold of them. She had to wait a few months for an appointment and filed them down herself. Never even realized they can make you nauseated. Makes sense now that I think about it.
She grabbed them and left. I hope she put them in her purse. The town I lived in was dirty in every sense of the word.
Like she did? Lol
I don’t understand how people are having difficulty with this.
"This is Reddit, so no."

"No, he's just going to explain that dental hygiene is very crucial to you not having these when you reach his age."

This cracked me up
"Hitler bad, red heads good."
Would you like a meta-explanation or a story recap?
Basilisk teeth destroy horcruxes except for that time one bit Harry because continuity error
Why... Why would he stay?
"I need more details on the ""made a scene"" part before I reach a verdict."
Well for starters I’d begin by not screaming.
"Already happened to me and I didn’t scream. I was in the supermarket and an older woman lost her teeth about 5 meters from me, to be honest it’s not really hard not to scream about that."
I mean it’s not uncommon for people to have denchers. Some people just don’t have as good of reaction time as others
*all* the teeth too
"Work with young kids, their teeth always be fallin' out. Had 3 in one day."
That probably didn’t occur to him
"Could be, could be."
"I think if I saw teeth fall out in any way I’d immediately think “prank” or “crown/dentures”, not in a hundred years would I just think the guy’s teeth suddenly came loose and dipped"
"Fuckin’ oath! Not a chance I’m just gunna be able to sit quietly & not freak the fuck out, whip out my dick & start gum fuckin’ that big, sexy, beast of a man. Like come on boss, a man’s only got so much self control. Fuck did you expect?"
"Ouft.

90,000 + karma, I bet you'd have some embarrassing and job losing worthy content on that account that would have people ""wilding"" in front of you."
Punctuation
"Then please explain, superior being, because my manager's teeth never ""fell out"".

Edit: someone less haughty explained it. It's dentures, presumably."
Threw*
Translation?
I thought it was about a guy who Vaped Hitler
"They took his soul, so he killed himself."
I don’t care what he wants I’d like both please
But the basilisk didn't kill Harry. Fawkes saved him with his tear. The horcrux (Harry) survived.
NO!
"He'd still get paid, so maybe the money is worth it to him."
To sabotage everything I did that day.
Fair I guess
I’m seeing an “oh Lawdy it’s the voodoo!”.
We don’t know that. It could be heroin

Fucking denchers.  Lol.  Ffs

"It probably did though. As someone who has a partial denture, and for my own reasons that I don't feel the need to explain to people on here, this is probably my main concern.

As you can tell by the content in this post and some of the weirdos on this comment section, they like to act like dicks about it.

Not only that, it's just picking on and making a fool of someone for their appearance, akin to being a highschool bully, or a toddler, whatever fits best.

Whoever the person is in this post is clearly inept."
Oh... because meth does that
Yes I too will whip out my dick in 0.5 ms in this situation
???
You forgot your spork
"My gramma does the exact same thing. I call it the abyss because she put everything in there. Usually it's her phone that hits the floor and gets our attention. My mama and I laugh hysterically and tease her for forgetting she hadn't attached her black hole for the day. She will spend forever looking for her phone only to have us ask if it's im her boobies. One of her phones died that way. 

She had it in her swimsuit and went down a water slide. When she came up out of the water, we could hear it vibrating. It made this shrill scream like noise and died when she pulled it out. It was murder and we still don't let her live it down."
Basic comprehension skills
"In our lives, will arise"
"No, it was the Girl with the Nazi Tattoo."
I mean ... pretty much
"To be honest I don't know if I can keep up the bit, and also it'd just be a lot of work.

Perhaps tomorrow."
"That's what I'm saying. As a horcrux himself, he shouldn't have survived."
Someone screaming at seeing dentures in person for the first time is a great way to get attention when you have a boring life.
"Doesn’t really matter if there’s a reasonable explanation for real teeth falling out, I’d just find that out after I’ve had a few seconds to collect myself"
"You can have your dentures fall out an indefinite number of times - meth-teeth only fall out once a piece unless they've started I don't know, gluing them back to their gums. Or I guess if they start the meth young you might get two sets.

So it's still pretty rare even if they've done all the meth, limited quantities."
"Yes, show me a case where all teeth came out in one go all attached to each other?"
Some people aren’t great at english
"Nah it’s all good dude I get it, I just wanted to call your bluff and see if you’d actually do it. If ya ever do you have at least one reddit enthusiast ready to read it for shits and giggles"
"He was merely poisoned from a stab wound that the Phoenix cured. Now, if he was gutted with the basilisk fang in the same way the diary was, it would be a different story. 

From my understanding of the books, simply touching a horcrux with something that has the capability to destroy them doesn't actually destroy them. They have to actively be trying to kill the thing. 

I don't think that slicing the locket with the sword of Gryffindor would have done anything. Ron had to chop it. 

So, if that basilisk fang were to kill Harry (like a stab in the heart or the venom getting to him before Fawkes helped out), it would also kill the horcrux part inside him. Since he survived, the horcrux did too."
If you expect people here to get that reference you must be dreaming
"Yeah, that’s fair. Now I feel bad."
like the original twitter poster for example
"Magic Micheal Jackson sports an '07 Britney Spears hairdo, freaks out over some speccy bitch's hallucination and then tries to go all Terminator one on some gumpy kid, making the most pedestrian magic user his mortal enemy. Hans Gruber was there for most of it coz he had a crush on the gumpy kid's mum."
Explain him surviving the Killing Curse at the end because I still can't wrap my head around it.
You got that reference. You are also people here
And why wouldn't they...?

Senor Spielbergo isn't in my top five directors, but *The Post* came out two years ago, it's a good film that was nominated at every show that year including 6 Oscars.  
*Bridge of Spies* came out four years ago, it's a very good film that was nominated at every show that year and won an Oscar, one of its 6 nominations.  
*Lincoln* came out seven years ago and needs no introduction as to how incredible that movie is and how much Daniel Day-Lewis is the fuckin' man.

I'm fine with him making an 'eh' movie with *Ready Player One* and even the pile of ass *The BFG* for those other films, and that's basically everything he made this decade. S-dawg hasn't lost his touch, you literally did not know those movies existed because 20-something Redditors (like 64% of this site, including me and probably you) aren't the demographic that his recent political thrillers were aimed at.

That, or you just forgot that the woeful shitfest that was Crystal Skull was over a decade ago, but I can't blame you because [we're *all* trying to forget that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4Vhkmb4Lw)"
The whole movie takes place in the future. 50% of the movie is fake. Its called movie magic. To me its immersive and unique. It draws me into the world more. If its immersion breaking for you then that's okay.
"I’ve seen only an episode and a half, and not all the effects were 100% done, but that was enough.  I have friends who worked/are working on it.  They were pretty bummed out too and showed me since they knew how much I love TNG."
It’s just my opinion of course
"Sphere builders are dicks,  bunch of real cool ships though."
"In Star Trek Online, the dyson spheres turn out to be constructed by the Iconians and their servitor races. Iconians gateways in the spheres eventually create a path from the Beta Quadrant to the Delta Quadrant through them. However, it turns out that the spheres are producing tons of Omega particles, and the Delta species (technically Beta species but whatever) Voth try to push the Feds, Romulans, and Klingons out to collect and use them on the Borg. Species 8472 from Voyager also attempt to take over one of the spheres as a base for an attack on Earth, which is defeated by an alliance of Feds, Romulans, and Klingons. Eventually the spheres are more or less cleared, but the Iconians invade and start warping them (and their stars) all over the place. You even briefly go inside one in the Andromeda Galaxy with Empress Sela of the remnant Romulan Empire. That sphere is filled to the brim with Iconians ships ready to invade the Milky Way, which they do. The Iconian War involves these spheres, but eventually you end the war with some classic Star Trek time travel paradoxes right before Earth is overrun by the Iconians.

The game even mentions how the mirror universe handles the Iconians and their spheres. A rogue Krenim scientist from the prime timeline gives Captain Leeta of the Terran Empire far-future tech for her fleet like time ships, which she uses to completely wipe out the Iconians and become the avatar of the Pah-Wraiths. The next few story arcs of the game deal with the temporal cold war. Last we see of the Iconians is a great mission where Quark, Nog, Brunt, and other Ferengi raid one of their fleets for the Sword of Kahless.

Honestly if you ever have time, I would give the game a shot. It's not perfect, but its story is the perfect Star Trek nerd's fever dream. Plus, the design for one of its main unique ships just showed up in a Picard prequel comic, so some of it might get integrated into canon soon!"
"Every loose plotline in the series leads back to the Iconians, the end.

The writers have fun out of how tangled up they can make things, I think. When it turned out the Vadwaar wiped out the Krenim because they were being controlled by the Conspiracy Parasites, which were created by the Iconians as a means of control..."
"It's too late, already got a phone

But like feelings or break bones I guess"
"No those movies were very mediocre too. Being a certain demographic doesn't mean shit. I enjoy political thrillers. I enjoy action and sci fi. I love movies in general and I can say Spielberg has lost his touch.

Just because they were Oscar nominated really means very little, it only means he campaigned for them. But I was bored to tears by all of his recent ""serious"" movies even though I was excited for them. Compare that with classics like Schindlers list, Empire of the Sun or Munich. The difference in quality is huge."
"Lol okay, so they turn out to be antagonists. Interesting."
That was a batshit crazy read. Thanks!
"I really appreciate the detailed description so thank you!

As for the game, does it have a definitive ending or is it one of those MMOs that just goes on forever? (Because those admittedly frighten me, lol)"
"Daaaaaang,maybe I really should try this game!"
DO YOU KNOW NO BOUNDS?
"Honestly if you look at the trailers, it’s a shockingly accurate representation of what you’re getting, though it’s extremely dishonest in the newer ones that show him reuniting with the old crew.  Those are all glorified cameos that are only there for fan service and don’t add to the plot whatsoever.  It’s the worst.

They also should have used de-aging on Spiner or not used him at all.  His inexplicably fat and aged Data is so fucking distracting that I wish it wasn’t even in the show.  They could have used a different, totally new character for his role but of course they need the “I know what that is!” viewership."
"If you really are interested there is a follow up [book](https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Sphere-Star-Trek-Generation/dp/0671541730) about it. I believe the books are still considered cannon. It has mixed reviews on Amazon but its a decent read, not the best Trek novel but certainly not the worst."
Not aided by me writing all of it on my phone lol. I come off much more like that meme where the crazy looking guy connects all the pictures in a conspiracy and not just a nerd avoiding going to bed.
"It's ongoing, but you could literally go ""Oh, I've hit the end of the story and done the bits I wanted to do for now, I'll put it down and come back later when there's more story"".

I've sunk a *lot* of time into that game, but I now only go back every now and then (couple of times a year?) for a week or two to clear any new story and experience the new content. Easy pick-up-put-down and free, so I'd say worth the time."

Comment
Nah you're good. She's a douche.
Honestly some girls are just there to be bitchy. I met my fiancé online and things he tells me about his experiences really hurt my heart. Don’t let the bitchy ones get ya down. :)
"How to get karma:
1. Screen shot this conversation 
2. Add JonTron ""holy shit you fucking killed her dude""
3. Upload to r/dankmemes
4. Enjoy karma flow"
Yo fuck that bitch if she doesn't know Journey she's not worth your time bruh
"Plot twist: 
She was going to say that she's gonna change that fact that you don't get laid. But you ruined it."
"Judging by her haircut, neither does she"
She took a midnight train going nowhere
yoU dOnT gEt lAid dO yOu?
Good thing you took the time to scratch out her name... lol
In fairness this wasn't the best opener. Either make the joke or don't but don't send a message about how you were GOING to make that joke.
"I see that most people disgree with me, but isn't it possible she was just trying to sarcastically flirt with you? You obviously jumped to thinking she was being meanspirited, but I could see this being said with a wink."
"She's right and your second message proves it, but the worst thing of all is running to reddit for validation"
At least you get matches...
Pretty sure its not the app
"You dont get laid do you, OP?"
This took a slight /r/niceguys turn
Your opening message was cringe af to say the least
"OP is a reddit basic bitch. Did you tick enough boxes for a front page post? You sure did.

Did you contribute anything to humanity or my enjoyment of this shit-addled website? You sure didn't.

That girl's instincts are fucking sharp."
She kinda killed you man
"Dude...what?

Terrible opener..and she shoots you down so you come back with that....”comeback”...and post it to reddit?

Downvote me but dude this is pathetic.

Work on your game. I bet you feel real proud getting upvotes for being shot down."
"So you tried to be le funny tinder reddit jester with a shit opener, got blown up, and then came back with a ""witty"" (aggressive) comeback that is a rehashed Reddit joke, and now you're posting it here for our approval so you don't feel like shit.

Hey maybe a new personality that isn't Reddit would help you achieve more success on this app."
Not the reaction you wanted so you make fun of her appearance. You seem like a nice guy.
And they say men are the entitled ones. Please.
Classic lash out after being rejected unfortunately.
Your angry answer sounds like she's right
God awful opener straight into niceguy territory after she struck a nerve. I'm pretty sure the app isn't the problem here.
"Jfc, the guy just had a mental meltdown and responded like an 14yo and everybody is clapping on the comment section, what????"
"Oh OP, r/niceguys is that —> way"
"She fucking destroyed you, and then you lost your shit and ended up looking like even more of a fool."
Like what did you expect with the shit opener. I’m surprised there’s even a response at all. Just a “hey” would have been better at that point.
Wow you are fragile
Yikes
You didn't deserve it. Damnit Karen!
"This is why we can't have nice things, Karen."
r/fuckyoukaren
/r/niceguys
Don't say lol. Who laughs at their own lame joke?
Why bother to be on tinder if you're going to act like this?
"You thought she was cute until she rejected your pathetic attempt to lure her. This is some NiceGuys shit.

EDIT: I can see that I have triggered some incels based upon the fluctuation in karma. Not that I care about the karma, just funny how I have you virgins dancing."
When did r/tinder become r/NiceGuys ?
She’s a bitch
"Guy: *sends lame ass opener*

Girl :""That wasn't a great opener""

Guy: ""I hope you and your kids die KAREN you fucking ugly fat slut, pfft, you're not even the first girl I've harassed through text TODAY"""
Nah she's good. You're douche
You're both the asshole.
r/niceguys
you know we can still see the name Xd
"Meme accounts for days man, it makes you feel like less of a human shit"
*Tinder management sweats*
I like how you didn't deny the not getting laid part.
Goddammit Karen!
I just uninstalled all my dating apps.
"Saw the scratched out name
Thought it said “kevin”"
"thats a catfish/fake profile, the photo set is about 15 years old and contains many nudes

not a real account"
How do you get that small screenshot?
"Kudos to you for hiding the name, OP!"
"Wow what a bitchy response. 

I would have just not replied."
"''pfff look at this first comment. If III started conversations here I'd be so clever funny interesting and charming...

if.''"
"Shit. I do stuff like that all the time... completing lyrics, lines from movies, gosh.... That means I don’t get laid?"
"It’s hard to judge a sense of humor with the picture but looking at her I’d say long chats about nail varnish glitter would be a daily occurrence , best avoided since you’re capable of such excellent put downs, your mind would be starved in that company"
Took the midnight train to bitchville apparently
I really appreciate that you scribbled out her name but then continued to write her name in the message. Made me laugh.
You'll be okay man. Don't stop believing.
Ah tinder lol I'm sure if I wasn't banned I could have some good fun too
"Should have said ""and youll be living in a lonely world"""
What's the point of covering her name if it's obviously Karen
"Some will win, and some will lose"
Don't stop believing...that your expired coupons still work.
r/FuckYouKaren
"Your fault for not finishing the song. Should've said ""just a small town girl~ you wun sum fuk?"""
"""you dont get laid"" WELL WHY TF ELSE WOULD I BE ON TINDER"
"Holy shit she saw right through you

Also you can’t insult her appearance *after* you feel rejected, then you’re just salty"
Tell me a smooth pickup line for my crush.
Haha! Making generic funny comments on someone’s looks is funny! Guys get the joke?
What a twat
"""Coupon Caren"" would be a great serie, or or movie."
If she keeps it up with that attitude she’ll stay living in a lonely world.
"4AM jp
justt vvph3."
Having a hard time figuring it out who's more lame
"oh look, 2 equally  immature people on an app about meeting other  society  sewage wastes like yourself, nice"
I would smash this guy 10/10  whilst singing this song.
Don’t shoot your shot at women who look like this.
"So edgy and cool. I hope one day, when I grow up, I can be a dick to strangers just like you are."
"This guy hides the name on top but then writes her name in the last message, ok boomer you deceived us."
"I like how you scratched out her name, but said her name in your message."
"The right answer would've been 'No, you wanna help out with that'"
You both sound lame
Can someone explain?
You definitely don't get laid lol
"Why hide the name, just to show it in the messages"
Looks like a 34 yr old mom
ESH.
At least i dont look like a boomer*
No idea why the hair cut gets so much shit. I think its sexy
Who's complaining here?
Gotta love the fact u erase her name but calling her Karen anyway
Not only does OP have a lame personality based on the opened but he’s also a wuss based on the reply and this thread.
I don't see how you cannot laugh that off. Take it easy man.
"Get off the app,  and approach people IRL.  Try 100 days of rejection therapy. 

I walked into a pool hall and asked for an hour pool table to go,  told him I had a truck outside and I'd bring it back. 

Bartender, my friends & I became friends,  had free and discounted drinks and chilled there for like 6 hours.  

Moral of the story,  you're a unique singular point of existence and nothing or nobody can replicate you.  Unless you sabotage yourself With your own mind. 

Jump headfirst into things,  and let you charm,  personality & humor pave the way.  

If you make mistakes,  apologize,  and then Carry on.


You're leveling up your speechvraft skills lol,  you gotta work at it.  

Also chances of success IRL is like so much better than tinder.

You're a single picture swipe away from oblivion,  a frozen moment, not speaking beyond the milisecond slice of whatever you think sells you best. 


Nah bro,  u sell you best in person. It's like doing stand-up,  but your audience is one person. It's like trying to sell horseshit to a farmer,  you gotta have a gilded/silver tongue,  and u only get that through repeated trial and error to find out what works, how and when and where."
That was an acceptable and funny first line. She is a twat.
I find it strange when matches don’t respond to you reading their profile. It’s the only thing other than a comment on photos that I can create a conversation starter.
"Hmm name of that girl is covered up, but she gets called by name in the text... Well done"
She made a shittest for sure
Bro... you blocked out her name up top but didn’t block it out from the text. Haha
The type of person who only swipes right to see if you match so she can feel validated
LIVIN' IN A LONELY WORLD
"Don’t worry, I would’ve done the exact same thing in your situation. Except I wouldn’t have resisted the urge, I would’ve finished the lyrics"
"Tinder highlights the fact that females can be sexist, self entitled, disrespectful, ignorant arse holes. And no one talks about that, we only focus on feminism and girl power. Hmmm."
If she doesn't like Journey then her line may end with her.
r/FuckYouKaren
"is this what the children mean by ""clap back""?"
What a bitch.
You don't get laid do you?
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Seriously WTF did she expect from posting lyrics in your about me section. People are going to talk about it. He did much better than “hey I like that song too”
"r/splatbutt117 Is the truth. 

Your better off with handgina, If that's what's on offer... Absolute, spunk rag.

Swerve the dangerous low blow. Used to know girls, like this... Ended up with what could only be described, as a cactus cock. The STD clinic didn't even know wtaf, It was. For real! She literally poked It for 10 minutes and shrugged her shoulders, as If to say; 'sorry lad, your cocks fooked mate'

Took 18 months to clear up... Handgina, Is the one, bruv!"
"I had a coworker of mine (31f) have something similar happen. The guys profile said he liked a particular baked good that she had never heard of before so she messaged him about it. She said “I’ve never heard of those before, what are they?” expecting the usual “oh they are really tasty and round and flaky...etc.” Instead he said “ are you kidding me?” She didn’t respond because she thought he was just being a jerk. I’m putting this story out there because it happens to everyone and it is partially because communication through messages just seems like a bad way to get someone’s particular sarcasm or if they are really being a dick."
Well yeah its karen
Thug life
Both douches
"I’ve had woman “accidentally” match with me, but instead of unmatching will send messages like “it was an accident, you’ll never have a chance with someone like me” 
I find it absolutely hilarious and kinda like it because at least I know not to waste my time on a piece of shit early into the convo but I know some guys care about what people think of them and I feel bad that this shit could happen to them and they feel like shit just cause some bitch wanted to make herself feel better by talking down to them."
Ayye congrats! I'm currently on my honeymoon with my new wife who I met on Tinder in 2014. It's been a whirlwind!
"That's why they're single lol.  On another note, thanks for the encouragement! :)"
"One girl said to me “too keen, no thanks” after asking a question. What..."
"I remember a girl I matched with was an engineering major who wanted to do a really specific job with it. Her line was “ so I hope you’re not intimidated by girls who are smarter than you “ and that the major I wanted to do was less substantial than hers


Maybe she was negging me but it was just absurd"
"I work with some toxic women that love to fuck with guys on tinder and talk about it. It's like a game of talking trash on guys. Buttttt they all single, and Erika had to call out for three days because she didn't know she had a tampon up in there and had sex with Bryan with it up all in there, and got a bad infection so like you tell me who the ratty ass is MMMHMMM"
"kicked it off with literally the first girl I matched on tinder. Got a date, deleted the app, been 5 years and counting as of Saturday lol. Honestly probably dodged so much bs"
"Women are very often like that. They get bored since they get like 400 matches per day, and just be bitchy out of boredom. Men aren’t even human to most women, at least on tinder"
I’m testing this. I’ll report back
"5.Find the post
6. Repost it to r/comedyhomicide
7. Enjoy the double income"
Her name is Karin lol
Then repost that to r/comedyhomocide
Don’t forget to post it to r/comedyhomicide with a different account criticising the post on r/dankmemes
Post it to the trashpile that is r/FuckYouKaren while you're at it
I remember when this sub was mostly dudes getting chicks in clever ways. Not it seems it’s dudes being too corny or salty lol
TBF he’s using a 40-year-old reference then kinda complaining *she* looks old
I’d prefer she not know journey to her being one of the assholes that only knows don’t stop believing. There is no “south Detroit”
Could easily have been the intro to some flirty banter but OP went nuclear instead.
She does. She's got 8 kids by 6 different fathers.
"> I'm laying down rn, hbu"
Her names not actually Karen but she got that Karen haircut
But how else will I signal my social anxiety to a stranger
also ending a statement with lol makes it sound less confident like you're needing to tell her you're making a joke.
"yeah, agreed. OP's play was pretty bad either way. should just interpret people in the most charitable way possible. if she was really a nasty person, then she'd give you a second chance to find out. if she just had a lame insult-""flirt"" (which is 90% of the submissions on r/tinder btw, except guys doing it) then you can save the encounter.

i don't think i'm going out on a limb by thinking most people in the subreddit are young and inexperienced. you can tell by the number of guys thinking this was an EPIC play."
Possible? Sure. Likely? No.
"(gets Karen vibe from this reply, waits for the existential rage and downvotes)."
"Well then this should be a good case study: most men will not interpret ""you don't get laid much"" as anything other than mean spirited. If it was a flirt, it was a bad one"
"With an attitude like OP, I believe so."
Slight?
"Dude deserved to get clowned then came back with some tired ass ""lol Karen"" shit."
It's sad that her response killed him. There used to be a time when you needed to pull a Dave Chapelle to murder someone sad to see the standards have dropped so much
"The fuck dude, there are better ways to reply to a terrible opener. Like not reply at all

Also what do you even do when the only thing in her bio is most likely that?Make a Rick and Morty reference and hope it lands?"
"This is basically what I said except worded much better.

Can’t believe this even got upvoted at all?"
"Man went full reddit.

Never go full reddit."
">Not the reaction you wanted so you make fun of her appearance. You seem like a nice guy.

Tit for tat. 

Men value their ability to get laid. 

She attack.

Women value their looks. 

He attack."
I literally never heard a woman say that.
"Why does your post history not surprise me in the slightest?

It can't be your fault, it must be the *women!*"
That and the title of his post. *Karen* might be onto something here.
"There's struck a nerve and then there's common decceny. In that you shouldn't be insulting people just for trying to start a conversation, especially on Tinder where that's the whole point. Might wanna adjust you fedora pal cause its blocking your view."
It shows that he at least glanced at her profile.  It's a hell of a lot better than just 'hey' or 'wanna bang?'.
She probably heard it a dozen times already.
Like OP
"this sub is basically a support group for guys who can't successfully use tinder. the problem is that it's an echo chamber where nobody even gets to see a successful encounter, it's just memes and insults."
"Maybe it's just me, but I don't even see her comment as that bad. There's like a 50 percent chance she's just poking fun at a lame opening line and giving you a chance to acknowledge it and come back. What else should she have replied, ""ok"" or ""lol""?

Most women don't understand how fragile men are with these things."
"She was rude to him for absolutely no reason, and now we're circlejerking ""this sub is full of incels"" because he clapped back? tf?"
Nobody should respond maturely to a person like that. What's the harm?
It was funny. Half the point of this sub.
Did you expect r/tinder to not be filled with social awkward pussies?
I’m just here to know if Karen’s with that haircut know they’re a meme. I want to know her response.
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

"Yeah I thought the same thing.

OP took the L here. Can not believe this post is even being upvoted..is this sub closely related to the incel sub?"
"False! hey is the worst in my experience. Even ""was Hitler really that bad?"" is a better opener you might end up banging a crazy neo-nazi....crazy in and out of bed ;)"
"Internet points, of course.

Maybe a psyop to get people to use tinder less?"
"It was such an inoffensive opener and she was rude for no reason. How is this niceguys shit at all?   


At *worst*, what he said was bland and not worth a reply. But it was fine, definitely nothing I'd feel the need to be snarky about."

oh cool"
"Hit them with something along the lines of, ""No worries. I swiped last night when I was drunk and you definitely looked better then. Glad we both agree I'm out of your league."""
I feel bad for the guys who do take that chance. Lol you just matrixed that bullet.
"""someone like me""

And this tells me what you're like. 

No worries, I wouldn't ever give a chance to someone like you either."
"Damn, you must be a really good tenant if you’re living in her head rent-free"
"Shit like this, amongst other things, is why I don’t think I’ll ever try dating apps. I’m an average height guy with an average slim build and a mediocre jawline.

Other than the period of time I was in a relationship with a girl who had done some modeling (and to this day remains the single most beautiful person I’ve ever met) and constantly told me how attracted she was to me, I’ve never had a high opinion of myself. And really, given how things ended and all the things she lied about, I have no idea if the nice things she said about me were lies too. 

Anyway, what I’m getting at is that my self-image isn’t all that great, and the combination of using Tinder and not getting matches/getting ghosted/people being rude would probably be super detrimental to whatever shred of self esteem I have left. One of my friends keeps telling me to get out there and how easy it is, but he’s stupid good looking and has women throwing themselves at him everywhere. Seems like dating apps are pretty much only for guys like him."
I always replied with “you think you have a chance with me? I only matched with you because you look like you give free blow jobs”
"Of course you'll never have a chance with someone like that. You have standards, and you deserve better than that."
This is why I just dont use tinder. Dont get to give them the opportunity to make me hate life even more.
"> “it was an accident, you’ll never have a chance with someone like me”

She's either after The Chase™, or for some spicy banter. If this happens again reply with something equally spicy."
"It was an accident, youlll never a chance with me. Maybe two or three, but never one."
"I once legitimately super liked someone by accident when the app froze and I ended up hooking up with them anyway because I was too embarrassed to tell them about the mix-up.

Yeah, I don't come off looking so good in this story..."
To be fair Tinder does sometimes match you with people who you didn't swipe on. I'm not saying it's fair to abuse people but some of them might have genuinely been matched by mistake
I’m fucking disgusted. Tell me more.
You don’t get laid do you?
Yikes. This riiiiight on the cusp of incel territory.

Perhaps if I share my deep social anxieties up front she will pity me and open her vagina for me
"It's hard to say, but the correct response would be something along the lines of ""I'm living in a lonely world"". That would have given her a conversation opening and possibly taken it in that direction."
"I disagree with this advice. Personally I feel like if the first thing someone says to you is an insult you should drop them as a potential mate. It shows a lack of respect in my opinion and if they are that disrespectful to you in the beginning can you imagine how much worse it would be as you got to know them? 

Also ""You don't get laid do you?"" is 100% a douchebag thing to say even as a joke to someone you just met. Maybe some friend groups could get away with it to each other but you don't take that kind of risk with a stranger. You don't blatantly insult people you just met. It shows poor character and poor social skills (if you genuinely thought it was ok to be like that). Kings deserve better. Even the court jester deserves better. 

If we want to interpret her actions in the ""kindest"" way I would say that she was trying to neg OP. OP still deserves better though because negging is a bullshit tactic to pick up a mate."
"This sub is full of edgy narcissistic assholes with low emotional intelligence.

But OP managed to somehow put across his thoughts while also seeming timid with the ""lol"" part.

"Not to mention that IF that was all she wrote, the odds of her getting a really interesting opener are going to be really low. The point of the bio is to sell yourself beyond what you look like and to give the other person some insight as to what you're all about. For the most part people who are on tinder to actually date understand this fairly well but for people that are on tinder **strictly for validation**, it tends to get lost. My advice is never swipe right on bio's that are blank, only have their Instagram name or only have quotes/song lyrics. Sure you miss 100% of the shots you never take but swiping right on those kind of profiles only enables the kind of shitty behavior that she demonstrated."
"Then maybe change the bio, unless she liked using it to weed ppl out, in which case there's still no need to be a ginormous bitch about it"
"You'd almost imagine that that would motivate her to change it, right?"
It really is. And it gets cringier by the month.
"There are a few interactions that go really well, you just have to screen out all the name puns and cases where the dude is very obviously hot enough to compensate"
"But he hit her up so he obviously was interested. 

Its a typical ""well you were ugly anyways!"" after being rejected. The second he replied he lost.

Also everyone here is getting INCREDIBLY defensive about the word ""virgin"" being thrown at them. It just isnt a very confident look."
"Regardless of what she said, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you’re attacking their looks... because you decided to match with them anyway"
It was an incredibly lame line and if you can’t handle getting called out for being shitty at flirting sorry buddy have fun staying a virgin
"Idk, it could also be read as bants."
*wamen
Was it funny? He's clapped back with an overused meme. 1/10 all round
"That's the whole point of the sub

A bunch of sexually frustrated trolls messing with people and ruining any chance at a normal life for internet points"
"A niceguy by definition is someone who unsuccessfully hits on a woman, gets rejected, then insults her appearance because she rejected him. Why even message her if he found her physically unattractive?"
"There *are* lots of incels here and a lot of people circlejerking when their super dumb line doesn't get them laid ""tHiS BiTcH HaS No sEnSe oF HuMoR AmIrItE GaIs?"" but I agree this isn't an example of that.  I mean his line isn't great but it's hardly the trash we see here most days and the woman roasted him pretty hard."
A normal person doesn’t call her ugly after she rejects him. That is the difference.
"Leave him alone, if he defends her honor, he might get a crumb."
"Really just throwing up an arbitrary number but probably close.
80% or more in this subreddit is filled with minor roasts or edgy jokes and this guy flips over an obvious joke."
Or: i never lose.
Gotta safekeep that virginity
True it is priceless
r/weezer
"Regardless, he doesn't stop believin!"
"Its funny how virginity used to be seen as a very good thing to have back in the day, and now its an insult to be a virgin.

I say who cares either way, sex is cool and all but I felt very pressured to have it as a teen so I wouldnt be a virgin, which is just really dumb just have it whenever you are ready."
It's worth a lot
Never gonna let you down!
I like big butts and I cannot lie!
"Well then maybe, and hear me out here, don’t have a Journey reference in your bio."
That does not give her a good reason to be an ass about it. Also if she was not happy about that its pretty easy to just change her description.
"Here we go againnn, blaming the guy for apparently not being able to entertain the girl good enough, its a two way street and she was a douche"
"Can't stand when people try and walk me through their thought process instead of just saying what they think. This is primetime mfer, come back when you're ready for it."

"I'm betting HPV there is over 100 strains and some clear up within 1-2 years.

Also, cactus cock would be typical of HPV."
"Why would you feel the need to add ""no homo"" at the end  that very non-sexual remark? 

Makes it sound more homo if anything"
"Handelina Jolie, for sure."
Totally tweaking
Most of the time those are probably bots which get their accounts deleted so the match disappears.
"I believe what your talking about is what I consider the tinder conspiracy. 
Tinder regularly tells you that you have new messages/ matches even when you don’t to get you back on the app. Ever notice that most of these ghost profiles only happen if you don’t use tinder for a couple days? I honestly think that it’s their way of getting you to come back just like some games will give you special offers if you don’t play them for ages. 
But it gets worse, I 100% believe a comment that was from a ask reddit or something similar where he said that he thinks that sometimes only one of the two people will see that they matched. 
For example let’s say there’s a pretty girl then there’s me, tinder tells me we matched, but she never replies and most guys think it’s just because she has so many other matches,  but what if it’s because she never actually swiped right, what if tinder selects profiles that are obviously people that are attractive and randomly match them with people who don’t get many matches so it boosts their confidence and makes them want to use the app more.  

Maybe I just saw the comment and connected with it because it made me feel better about myself that it’s not me that’s getting rejected but since I saw that comment I’ve seen so many of the signs for myself that’s it’s kinda hard to deny."
"Why would that destroy you? Why give a random person who doesn’t even know the first thing about you that much power over you? Why would you even care?

The only people who’s opinion should matter are those people who have earned your respect. Not every random stranger. That’s no way to live buddy."
"Nah just ""you're eyes are kinda far apart"""
“I honestly just swiped right so I could show other people how asymmetrical your face is”
"that's cringey as fuck imo.

i'd just give an honest assessment: ""careful you're projecting your own insecurities"""
"No no no

""That's a shame. I like heavy girls."""
Meta
"I’m bisexual, so actually, I get laid a fair amount. Guys don’t play games and get off on cruelty and manipulation like women."
You don't get laid do you?
"Make a guys profile, make a girls profile. You'll quickly see that girls get tons of matches. That's not incel or sexist, it's just how it is."
Wait what
Pretty easy to see with \*that\* blackout job.
It couldn't be Katie because the t would be visible.
"The t would probably be visible above the crappy censorship, right?"
Looks like Keri
"It literally would have been better to just finish the lyrics instead of this awkward mess. People are acting as if she's some massive bitch, but I feel like most people would think he never gets laid with openers like that."
One match I got posed with a duck on her profile. She said every other guy started the conversation with a comment about the duck face. I didn't. We're now living together.
"People are defensive about the word  virgin"" because others insist on using it as an insult when it really shouldn't be."
"This sub is pure r/niceguys at times. Maybe, *just maybe*, she was making a fucking joke? Or can this sub only identify humour if it's in meme format?"
You don’t make many friends talking like this do you
"Sadsturbating gatekeeper.

Why are you getting so upset about a low effort reddit post"
"You are actually too dumb to argue with. I read through this thread out of curiosity, and you don't have anything to say. The only reason you think anyone likes you is that they're too afraid to tell you that they don't."
"it could've been, but if it is you gotta expect that's really easy to misread. even if op was being a bit defensive"
"it's honestly not that bad. he looked at her profile and said something relevant, even if it wasn't that clever. it could've been a *lot* more stupid than it was"
She didn't reject him she personally insulted him. I personally think she might have been trying to banter but it was oddly aggressive lmao.
Hard to know if it was just banter or an actual insult over text. Obvious jokes can sometimes come off as an insult in texts depending on how they take it.
Sounds like you’re flipping out over his obvious joke. It blows my mind that people unaware as yourself exist.
Kreygasm I lost.
I NEVER FREEZE
Can’t let that virginity vanish
Eh saved you 40 bucks in drinks
I feel personally attacked
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna turn around

Tinder said I had a message when I downloaded the app without even creating an account or logging in on it.
"It's no conspiracy - Tinder, Match, OKCupid, and Plenty of Fish are all owned by Match Co., which is currently being sued by the FTC over this practice of spoofing matches to gain membership subscriptions. 

[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/09/ftc-sues-owner-online-dating-service-matchcom-using-fake-love](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/09/ftc-sues-owner-online-dating-service-matchcom-using-fake-love)"
"Yeah, it definitely sends you fake pings if you stop using it for a bit"
"Its really not a conspiracy, it does that 100% if we could see the source code you'd see that there are tricks all over the place. I tried tinder for a little while but ultimately uninstalled when i saw that it was all like the other free dating apps"
But when it happens enough it starts to feel like it's you who's wrong. I got off dating apps and just talk to women now irl and even if you get turned down it's way less dehumanizing and demoralizing especially since people wont say that kinda shit to your face.
"thanks, this wasn't the time it sank in, but i appreciate the effort."
"The random cruelty some men and women project onto others through tinder can sometimes feel like it's directed at the receiving person and that can really fuck with people. ""Oh, this person is suddenly directing all of this aggression at me, all of these words about worthlessness, people wouldn't do this randomly right? That must mean I deserve this. Do I deserve this? Why me? I must've done something wrong. If this is the reaction my profile is inducing, I MUST to blame"" something like that"
"Of course its no way to live but its quite understandable why it happens. Person is lonely, person has low confidence, person downloads app which seems to be best/easiest solution to fixing both those problems, person doesn't get many matches, matches that person does get are similar to one OP posted. Can't blame said person for feeling like they are the one with the problem."
Clearly this dear is not rational so there is no point in pointing out it's isn't rational. You are either good looking yourself and have never had to worry about this or you just  don't have this happens to you.
"Nah they don't give a shit about any kind of actual response, you gotta hit them the way they tried to hit you with some shallow comment about their appearance."
I like this one
I've heard this exact thing from a lot of bisexual people.
Hate to break it to you... Crappy online behavior easily goes both ways. There are plenty of men that treat women like disposable napkins. Source: am female. Kudos to the people making it work for them tho.
At this rate it might make it to r/all. Which would be sad but also kinda hilarious that such a low effort meme can go that far.
Threesomes happen. She just didn't bother DNA testing the kids.
"Two of them are split down the middle, like a chimera cat."
"Actually this can happen. I watched a documentary once called ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" and there was a man who was actually the child of one hundred homicidal maniacs."
It's actually Kiefer
Pretty sure her name is Karin.
kanine cause she a bitch
"Man dudes really have to be charismatic as fuck. Never used tinder myself but it seems like to have even a smidget of a chance they have to come up with a witty original joke, and at the same time they're being judged by a woman who can be incredibly boring herself."
"""you don't get laid"" is about someone's attractiveness. It doesn't matter that it isn't about his physical appearance. It's wildly rude and inappropriate to say to a stranger"
You're going to blame this one on the guy? For real? Or is this just another flirt that needs to be properly interpreted?
"> when it really shouldn't be.

Why get defensive then? If someone calls me something that doesnt make sense I dont get defensive"
Because everyone’s acting like this guys some poor victim because some woman was slightly rude to him.
Alright well my response to that is I hope you get murdered

Then she is an asshole? Im not really understanding your argument you are making it seem as if because she gets a 100 of the same message it makes it ok to be an ass?
"Or, maybe, not sure though, she could just not say anything at all and unmatch."
Druggies and ppl from Birmingham
Dickspensary
Say Geddy Lee!
There definetly is
Monthly fee?
"Match dot com is where the lawsuit originates, and is a very different beast to Tinder. 

There are less matches as a whole on old school dating sites, and you have to pay for access to message matches. There's a profit incentive to create fake matches and justify the purchase with a false image of the oasis on the other side. 

Tinder is the opposite. The access is all free. You instead want them paying for help to get matches, boosts/supers/unlimited swipes. The only profitable fake would be to hide their matches, make it seem like a largely barren land you need a guide in, until they buy gold access.

The reality is, Tinder creates it's own hell without trickery. They just picked the right complimentary powers to monetise this time."
"While you are right in 99% of the cases. I was once playing out side as kid (12 years ca) and there was a fooball/soccer match a randrom drunk dude aproach me and said to ""Do you know how fucking ugly you are?"" and he and his budies started to laugh.

That is the kind of shit that fucks you up. Because there is always these nearly whisper in my head ""maybe he was right""."
I don't tinder but just want to say this 100%. There's only so many times you can get back up before you start to question things and start thinking in that direction.
"Implying a gal might be a bit heavy should be your go-to knockout punch, right next to telling her to ""calm down"". 

It's the female version of implying a guy has a little dick or that he's inept sexually."
"If you were involved in gay dating you'd know this is an absolute crock of shit. Plenty of guys play games, men are just more direct when it comes to sex."
Step 3: Profit!
"Shoutout kiefer, best lofi artist in the game rn"
"This isn't the case.

I'm a pretty average looking guy, and I just talk to women like people.

""Hey Sarah! Your kitten is SO cute! What's his name?""

If someone doesn't respond to that after matching with me (which they often don't), then I don't want to talk to them either. I'm not there to entertain them.

----

I'll swipe for about 5-10 minutes every day or so (it's fun). I'm extremely picky, I swipe right on <5% of people. I hit it off with someone and get a date every week or two."
Honestly just get tinder and tell them about your magnum dong
"Either finish the lyric or don't. 

OP said something, but it didn't actually open up the conversation."
Agreed. I'd prefer an actual conversation over an opener any day. But that won't get you karma on reddit I guess.
"Oh yeah cause girls are magically attracted to normal conversation starters like hi or if you're feeling frisky: hi, how are you?"
Like at least throw an emoji or something in there.
"I'm not blaming anyone, I think both people come across like assholes. Just saying that I think the girl made a rude joke about how lame that opener was. And it was pretty fucking lame. Was it rude? Yes. Did OP overreact? Also yes."
" > because others insist on using it as an insult

come on man."
r/decresinglyverbose
You said druggies twice
"IDK, its just part of the sad story I  made up. lol"
"Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold. Unlimited swipes, 5 Superlikes per day to use, 1 Boost per month, and with Tinder Gold, you get all that plus the ability to see who swiped right on you before you even see their profile."
When you told that story I pictured how full of self hate that guy must have been to want to make you feel that way about yourself and that he was essentially speaking into a mirror.
"I’ve been involved, dumbass. Never in my life have I gotten my dick sucked faster than I have playing the mind games women require. If you knew anything about dating and casual sex you’d know we’re right."
"Judging by the number of responses I get to messages, starting a conversation doesn't work too well either. I'll match, send the girl a short message, usually pertaining to something I found interesting in a picture or her bio, and get no reply. Such is life, apparently."
r/subsifellfor
Nonsense no one from Birmingham has ever used h.
Thank fuck I’ve been using tinder for fucking years and just shit myself that I’d been getting hit with a hidden fee all this time lmao.

"They could have called a foul on the floor, but he didn't touch him during the shot."
ITT: Ball dont lie
#BALL
Good Guy Josh Richardson: Knows that he was gifted a BS foul call. Misses the free throws on purpose.
Am I dumb? Didn’t he put his hand on Joshs hip right before he shot?
"Putting your hand on a dude while coming off a screen is a foul, maybe soft but not an egregious call"
"Could just be the angle, looks like he shoves his hip slightly on the way into the shot which could have caused him to sway more than if he wasn't pushed. Definitely didn't touch him after he started his shooting movement though. If they know it's not a foul then why don't they challenge it? Perhaps they were out of challenges, I don't know?"
So sick of seeing players kick their legs out like that. It's completely unnatural for a normal jumpshot (if they intend to land back on their feet) and that contact shouldn't count. Fade aways can be an exception for sure.

Look at gasol’s anticipation for that rebound. Also the actual rebound looked really athletic ...
Bringing balance to the ~~force~~ court.
The entire arena lost it when he missed that 3rd ft lmao
Richard Dawkins explain this bruh
This is an all time great ball dont lie moment
I love the basketball gods but I think this is Richardson being purely honest and showing respect to the game.

"My wife just kept saying Ball don’t lie, ball don’t lie. ...  and she’s 56!"
"Am at the game, boos got louder after each miss, it was hilarious."
The basketball gods have delivered justice
The probability of him missing 3 FTs in a row was 0.49%.
"Must've been the phantom injury he picked up on the ""foul"""
I’m sure the Toronto crowd was a big factor. Don’t think Richardson was expecting how loud we’d be
The basketball gods shine upon us
As if the embarrassment of bricking three straight free-throws wasn't enough punishment lol
He refused to take a 2way so went undrafted and we got em.
He bet on himself
He was actually really good at Ole Miss. He was recruited by most everyone as a 4* wide receiver but decided he wanted to play basketball. He didn’t do much his freshman year but exploded his sophomore. Had a down junior year during a coaching change and then had another great year last year.
Raptors are the new Spurs. You will be asking this a lot in the next decade.
He came from Ole Miss. Dude was a fan favorite here and everyone is so excited to see him succeeding in the league.
He went to my high school in north Mississippi
"I drafted him on my fantasy team and no one bid on him because they thought I was an absolute idiot.

Technical foul.
"I'm pretty sure their colour guy is an unapologetic homer, which is fine I guess."
clip?
What could they have possibly said? That TD had his hand on JRichs hip?
"People do not get how bad the raps get roasted on fouls.  I swear, if DeRozan got anywhere near the calls that other top 20s got, he'd be a HOF lock.  Individual players on other teams will beat the raps
For number of free throws.  

Conspiracy or not, wouldn't mind seeing a break down of foul call and shot number over the last 6 years compared to other teams."
RHJ stepping into the lane after the second FT and clapping in his face. Priceless.
That crowd felt like we were mid NBA finals for the free throws after Embiid just bricked 2 as well. It just continued throughout the game and seemed like the Raptors kept the momentum the whole time
Meek? If you’re talking about the dude next to Drake I’m pretty sure that’s his homie Chubbs
"Gasol could not hit a shot tonight, and was worth every minute of playing time."
"God dang. Couldnt get a layup, a free throw, anything. Karl is sitting somewhere very happy right now."
"Gasol didn't exactly score much either, but yeah, this was literally the worst offensive game of Embiid's life."
Is Nav the GOAT of fans? Idk who else really comes close
I remember several years ago he got yelled at by a ref for doing that lol
"Man has been bringing that same energy from day 1, I love him."
I remember seeing one pf the games during the Carter-Bosh days. I legit thought the organization was paying him to do that.
He should have been called for kicking out as well
"Love that guy, seems like he’s meshing well.

I wonder what happened to Stanley Johnson tho lol"
Kinda funny that meek was also at this game and they were sitting across from eachother
Might meet some kids if he's lucky
As soon as I saw that I was hoping to see u/Sim888 take all the reaction shots from Drake and the crowd like he does so well
"How come nobody tries taking screenshots of games for meme usage anymore, a couple years ago there would always be a few good ones in the top comments, and every time people bring up old screenshots now everyone loves it, but we never have new ones. The Drake laughing here seems like it’d be great for that lol

Do people just not like clicking on the links anymore or something? Just feels like there’s a lot less blue links and memes here in the past couple years."
I know Harden isn't well liked outside of Houston but this shit is on the refs. The refs need to fix this bullshit.
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come
It is just ball dont lie
this is the way
"Idk if this is a flop really, it's not like he asked for the foul call. He tried to draw one sure but this one is on the refs"
They took out the magnets for the free throws
Choose the dark side
"Not that hard to imagine a ref missing a call, let alone on a play like that."
Loves it like it’s a 15 year old girl...
"Yeah at first I though the foul was when he touched his hip, while watching it in game speed so it was quick but in the replay there was nothing"
#DON'T
"I'm not 100% sure you're not correct here, crazy as it would be to do that."
"""before he shot"""
This
I agree. Maybe should’ve been a foul on the floor at most though.
Not during the act of shooting tho
dunno why you're not getting upvoted more. it's like...clear as day
well to be fair....he didnt show up until the middle of the game.
#DON'T
But look at beginning dude grabs his jersey at the waist. That’s a foul
Rasheed Wallace smiling down from heaven.
You love to see it
so satisfying
if you dont like that then you dont like raptors baskteball
You love to see it
It’s actually 0.5%
"If we're being real technical, FTs aren't independent events."
"That's 1/200, so not astronomically small, but still surprising."
"Hey I'm stoopid, where do you get 0.17 from?"
RIPSheed
Rasheed Wallace died so that we could live
"Man, after reading this, Rasheed himself is going to be worried he's a ghost."
"Lol that's pretty funny, good win"
and then having drake laugh at you like that lmao
"The guy is an unreal rotation piece as a rookie. Always is finding a way to give effort and impact the game. 

Curious to see where his development is going to take him"
"Actually it's more about Denver already having him and they had absolutely zero money leftover in cap space so we got him cause he wanted to come to TO after he saw what our development staff has done for guys like Siakam, OG, and FVV."
"The FVV route. 

Masai is a genius."
Hotty Toddy
How recently did you go to Southaven? My old high school band director is now head director there.
RENT FREE in the Sixers head
Sixers will never reach the truth
May he rest in peace
This is assuming each free throw is an independent event. It also assumes that ball do lie.
"And he's actually a career 82.3%, so it's 

.177 times .177 times .1777 = 0.55%, just over a 1 in 200 chance."
quick mafs
Took you two tries eh?
5 yard penalty.
Draymond Im going to have to ask you to stop yelling
[WACK! GET OUT!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=in-W5OuCmS4)
I’ve only watched a 76ers stream once and that was my impression. At first I was like what the heck is he seeing but as the game went on it started to make sense.
"I'm going to be serious, I am really starting to get sick of alaa abdelnaby. At first his homerism was fun to hear but now I realize he bitches about EVERY dam call"
Maybe they assumed Richardson’s mid-air seizure indicated there must have been contact? I’d love to see a clip of them trying to defend this call.
"The only possible explanation is they thought the hip contact was a push that impacted the shot. In slow motion, that looks very dubious."
I think thats what the call actually was here and while it is a foul... soft.
I'm falling hard for that dude
Just straight disrespect haha.
Meek is sitting on the opposite side of the court infront of Drake
"The clip ends short, they cut to meek after drake."
Gasol made that one deep 3 pointer. Unforgettable
Gasol is like our 5th option on offense. We don't need him to score. We need him to defend and pass.
"Never heard of him so I gave him a quick google. Dude says he's been to EVERY home game since the Raptors became a franchise, 24-years ago. Also, he happens to be a top Hyundai dealer in Canada and is worth approximately $50million. Absolute GOAT. Absolute legend."
"Purple shirt guy in Charlotte, maybe. Spike Lee? You could also say maybe Cuban/Ballmer but they don't really count b/c they're owners.

Overall I agree. Navi seems like the best."
"well, right now he's injured, but when he was healthy, in his limited minutes, he had alarmingly bad tunnel vision on offense.  he's at the point where he might get a few minutes in a blowout, but would have to really shine in garbage time to earn any significant rotation minutes.  he's not playing the team basketball Raptors demand."
He has a groin injury I think
They’re chill-ish now aren’t they?
"100% 

Until the refs crack down on EVERYONE doing this shit, it won't stop."
The same.
Damn I didn't know NFL refs also worked in the NBA!
"If they were calling that, they might have given him continuation"
#LIE
"I mean physically let go of the ball, I’m not saying it is or isn’t a foul but even the slightest touch messes up a shooter when they’re in motion. I can see where the refs coming from"
But then it is not a non existent foul
**LIE**
If refs saw a foul they should have definitely called it before the shot
"But, he's still....

ok"
Sheed rolling in his grave right now.
Pour one out for 'Sheed.
Whys he in heaven lmao
He’s very much alive
"First off, Rasheed Wallace is very much alive."
Wade Boggs is still very much alive dude
Heaven is the name of a club or sth?
"Sheed just got his first win tonight as a high school coach. He was so pumped, great to see"
...sheed isn’t dead
Okay Jerry Lawler
lmaooo
Wade boggs is pretty much alive charlie
I rechecked the math and its actually 000.5%
It’s actually .5%
How strongly correlated are freethrows in a set or even game?
"These were from a shooting foul, the opportunity to shoot the next was not dependent on the outcome of the previous attempts. Is that the hair you were splitting?"
I think on average you're more likely to make the second than the first because you get more in rhythm. Though you're probably more likely to miss the second if it's given that you missed the first.
the guy above me said hes a career 83% shooter so chances of him missing a free throw is 1-(.83)=.17
100 minus Richardson's FT% of 83.
"in reality it's probably higher since missing the first free throw has a mental effect, and I imagine missing the first two really gets to you."
Tf is stacking probability?
"I can't emphasize this enough, Rasheed Wallace is very much alive. He lives in Tampa"
"Dont be scared Sheed,it was your time,walk into the light. RIP sheed"
His ghost is in denial? Spirit don't lie
loved RHJ getting in the mix to clap in his face too. that was dope
I would rather he starts over powell
If he was on a team that could give him 30+ mins a night I’d probably put him in the top 5 ROY talk. He has almost all the tools there and a great IQ and attitude on top of it. Always hustling
Isn’t each free throw an independent event? The first one doesn’t affect the second...
If you want to go into more detail you have like an extra 10% chance of hitting the next consecutive free throw or someshit. 3rd free throw is usually is somewhere  the 90%
At least he didn't miss 3 tries in a row. That'd be embarrassing.
10 second stop and go penalty
"All while being huge homers, I love them, both of our crews."
which is how it should be!
"""ah yes, he's a liar"""
"Most likely. Refs always call what looks like a foul, especially if they don't have a great angle."
"Meh... You could call a foul on 90% of mid range shots of that was the case. There's always going to be a little bit of contact, the hand on the hip had nothing to do with the shot imo"
"it's not a foul, if TD actually pushed him then it would be."
he's philly through and through
"Ahh ok that makes sense, I didn’t see him in the clip lol

He can get into Canada now?"
"Also he had the highest assists on the team, getting the ball in the net takes more than just shooting."
"He said “my family knows I will never miss a Raptors’ game. Birthdays, celebrations, they know ill be at the game”

I was like damn, this guy has a chill wife lol"
Nav also spends a boatload of money to bring kids from the community to the games. The man is amazing.
the Raptors gave him a ring.  He's easily the GOAT fan imo.
How’d you miss him during the Raptors playoff run last year?
Don't forget Jack Nicholson
"There is a private club designed by Drake in the Arena that's for celebrities, I wouldn't be surprised if they were chillish there."
as long as the beef creates music
This is just an easy way to give a team extra points. Y'all think one ref was fixing games?
"The shot IQ was not there on that one, agreed."
"Why the fuck don't they review footage and camera angles before settling on a decision though

Like.. Foul, pending review... oh, he didn't touch him. nvm carry on

Edit: bEcAuSe It WoUlD mAke ThE gAmE tOo LoNg is an excuse i've heard before.

Maybe quit flopping so much then?"
-Sheed
Yea I agree. Shouldn’t have gotten 3 free throws tho that’s all I’m saying
He’s a little confused but he’s got the spirit
You got it boss hog
Denial doesnt help anything. I know you miss him but you have to let go
He’s not dead he’s just stoned as fuck it’s fine
"""I can still hear his voice in the wind."""
May rest in peace
"If ball if life, and you no longer ball, then what is life?"
Sheed coexists everywhere at all times.
Unexpected Sunny??
We all know he’s still alive but the mfer has always lived in heaven
May he Rest In Peace
Mostly for rebounding but he’s still a good leader in the dressing room
He got too high and talked to God
living in Tampa
"He's alive, with the lord"
Yes he is. His legacy will live through our memories!
True - I see him in every mustached face I come across. His memory will live forever.
Just wish he had lived long enough to see it.
You’re right. He’s still alive in our hearts. RIP Sheed.
"Triple checked, it’s actually 0000.5"
Amazing
"They actually have a connection. Not only 2nd and 3rd FT have higher rates, but if you make the first you have a better chance to hit the second as well IIRC. There's some correlation."
The Ball Lie coefficient. About .420 per free throw
if you hit the first one you're more likely to hit the second one because you relieve some pressure and you grt used to the shooting motion
"I think it's more the idea that if you miss one, you might get in your own head and be more likely to miss the next"
Thanks my guy
Cool thanks for the info
Absolutely. Especially if he's feeling a lil guilty
Tampa? God rest his soul.
May he rest in piece
"Damn I thought he’d be in heaven

Tampa ffs"
"I know, right? smh at this disrespect, Rasheed Wallace is rolling in his grave right now"
"I like having him and Rondae off the bench. They play really well together with an unreal energy. Nick Nurse has gotten all of his rotations down this season, everyone is getting the right minutes in the right roles."
"Big jump to start. Guy has been playing well but Norman has been in our system for a long time and has way more experience guarding bigger players.

Powell’s offensive production can definitely be erratic, but at the same time I would trust him more in the starting line up for the time being."
I would like boucher to stay more consistent as well. Lots of potential there as a key bench player
Norm has been pretty good lately wdym?
He's not a starter yet. Maybe later into the year. Powell **might** be a worse player than him but he's proven and was on the championship roster. For now Davis is our backup PG.
I think he means it doesn't account for any mental factors involved with bricking the first and second.
"In a bubble, yeah.  But confidence does matter, and you bricking 2 free throws is going to make the crowd a bigger factor."
"Statistically, yes. But that would negate factors like psychology and crowd distractions. By the time you miss your first 2 I would say your chances of missing the third are much greater than your season % would suggest because of how jarring the situation would be on your concentration and confidence."
FT% of the first FT is generally lower than the FT% of subsequent FTs
It’s much rarer to airball a free throw on a second consecutive attempt...
"On paper it doesn’t, but if you miss 2 straight now you’re overthinking it. Mentality does affect it"
Klay Thompson disagrees with you.
"true, because you can do a slight adjustment from the first shot with better feeling"
"What about when you've lost the first two? What if we take out end of game situations? It's hard to measure it exactly, it was pretty damn unlikely though."
Josh Richardson in shambles
"Lewis, this is James..."
nice
Exactly lol... really questioning my judgement for a minute before I realized that.
Norm forgave him
[This clip is longer and has Meek's reaction](https://twitter.com/i/status/1199155147831533569)

"If you triple checked, why are there four zeroes? I think you need to check your math again."

"Gotta add some more significant digits.

It's 0000000000000000.5000000000000000%."
Nah it's 5*10^(-1)
"What's the statistics on making the first vs second free throw? I'm guessing the second is higher.

Theoretically, the second has a better chance of going in as you either make the adjustment if you missed the first, or you continue the same shooting motion if you made the first."
[citation needed]
no problem my friend
TIRED of this narrative. Josh Richardson consistently is in the lowest tier of guilt per 36 in the entire league
Tampa's easily one of the top 10 swamp cities in Western Florida.
"yep, he is most certainly not with us then."
RIP Sheed
You're right he plays best with RHJ.
bench mob is back. Ibaka at the helm
What's a regular starting lineup? What are regular rotations? Asking for ~~Rick Carlisle~~ a friend...
Boucher just chucks 3s and sometimes they go in. He plays amazing D. Like he is hungry.
"That's a good point and it's also stupid to assume Davis would keep performing the same if his role changed.

It's also a bad assumption to say a player will always be able to contribute more as a starter."
There are a ton of dumbass raps fans who think somehow Powell should be a superstar or something and are disappointed when he's not. Powell is playing his role perfectly right now.
Also.. **BALL DONT LIE**
"That's the biggest load of bull I've ever heard. The 80% already accounts for all the mental factors, given that it is a career average."
"Alright, so now to solve this we need... Psychology, to a level of perfection that isn't even possible, which we then need to apply to biology to understand exactly how the mental state effects the signals firing in the brain and contracting the muscles, to a level of perfection that isn't even possible, and we just need to take these measurements before each FT (including the first one), all while just using a digital representation of the player.

It's less than one percent, live with it."
Exactly during second 12 and second 34.
  True. But that means they are not identically distributed which is different from not being independent.
or false because there's more pressure?
"So much going on.

"I actually like Rick Carlisle, but he's done some weird things this year. Courtney Lee starting against the Knicks threw me off. Did he tell Rick ""put me in coach, its revenge game time"" ?"
"He had a rough start scoring wise and made a few mistakes on offense but he doesnt get rattled, hit a big 3 to stop a run, and was getting boards and playing steady D down the line. He does all the things we need him to do and he's been v consistent of late. But I feel like lots of fans dont watch games and his stat line often makes him look worse than he is"
"No you don't. You just need to compare FT% of first FT to second FT to third FT conditional on makes vs misses.  Not completely trivial, but the data definitely exists and you don't have to get out of basketball world."
What part??
Lmao 8: classic

"Funny story: There was a german saying in that time: ""Wiesbaden und Darmstadt wollen wir verschonen. Denn da wollen wir selber wohnen.""

It means ""We are gonna leave out Wiesbaden and Darmstadt as we plan to live there later"". Germans told this about their cities, assuming the allies would not bomb them. The saying existet for almost every city in germany. Wiesbaden. Heidelberg. Darmstadt. Mainz. Dresden.

And: I'd say they were bombed into peace. Not pieces."

"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
Pussy..
about as original as reddit itself
And your dog is missing
"Yup. That’s why me and my family doesn’t eat dogs.

Either they stopped doing that or incidents doesn’t travel far."
Chefs always say the most important part of cooking is love.
How would you know what dog meat tastes like?
lol same i just don’t like the people think china is all there is to asia
sound like a cool guy!
ok boomer
Today’s special: canes creamfilled
Because you accidentally ate dog turd when you we're 4 and thought it was chocolate
Comment
"A bitch, yaddle is. Make me pay for the little shit, she is. Not mine he is. Get more ketamine i must."
I miss r/legoyoda
"Ketamine addiction, I must fund."
So is Yaddle the baby mama?
"Charged with 23 accounts of vehicular manslaughter, I am."
He was going to call it Anakin at first.
"So he wasn’t hiding from the empire, just avoiding baby yoda"
"“To the store, I must go. Be right back, I will.”"
So Yoda was banging Padme and Luke was the chosen one destined to bring back all the child support from his illegitimate grandfather.
" Too much ketamine, yaddle has had. Crazy she is. Drive away with my 2001 Honda Civic, I must."
"My money, my choice."
He aint called master yoda for nothin
Holy shit the younglings was an inside job!
"Redid with Higher Res Screenshots [Here](https://imgur.com/a/2lsM4kF), Both With or Without Text( The font I used was Arial Black)"
I feel like Anakin might have a way to help him with that
"Half the comments here are lego yoda jokes, and the other half are people utterly confused and in the dark about THAT subreddit."
In a galaxy far far away one man is on a quest to evade child support.
"spent all my money on ketamine, I did. have an addiction, I do. run children over in my 2001 honda civic, I must."
"Ketamine, I must find"
"Hmmmn lied, Yaddle did. Not mine, that baby is. Give a credit of ketamine money for it, I will not"
"Save money for ketamine, I must"
"Evade child support, I must."
"Evade if I won't, force she will use"
Good meme
Bruh Yaddle got clapped hard
This is the way.
"Frogs to eat, there are."
"Douchebag, you are."
Was this 50 years before Mando? Could work theoretically
Imagine 50-100 years worth of child support.
"“good idea”
-Han solo"
Yoda been clappin cheeks
Kinda looks like organa is wearing a turban. I’m into it
Ohh I didn't know Yoda taught English in Vietnam!
u/calebs-mom
Yoda goes on the murray show.
There was a similar one about child support but no I haven’t seen this one yet
I'll be damned the little shit does belong here
"*child support, evade I must. Ftfy"
Is it basically confirmed that Yoda and Yaddle are the parents?
"""When 180 the child turns, child support, have to pay, I will not. """
Now we have two of them.
"Removed Yaddle from the council, I did. But still found me, she did."
Shit this is too relevant to my life.
Baby yoda
"Better father he is, the Mandalorian"
Luke never received any child support—and he became a legend.
You don’t know what day it was.
The reason baby yoda has daddy issues
"Run over minorities in a 2001 Honda Civic, I must"
Can't you at least use the same font?
"Run over Yaddle in my 2001 Honda Civic, I will"
"Time, I do not have. Get back to opressing minorities, I must."
"K hole, I have fallen in. 

Ladder, I do not have."
Why’d it get banned
That sub was supposed to be the chosen one.
/r/LegoYodaGang
Let it live on in prequelmemes ala this post.
What was it about?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WWaLxFIVX1s
Run over minorities I shall
I'm so /r/outoftheloop here...
Why are you guys so set on getting this sub banned?...
Wait no
"Pretty sure Yoda's species reproduces asexually. Like on Dagobah Yoda start having convulsions and birthed the baby, his body germinating a whole new one of his species."
"No, Yaddle is another of the same race who’s part of the Jedi council"
"Damn what am I missing in this thread? Ketamine, vehicular manslaughter...?"
"Hidin' from ""the Government"", you know."
Avoiding baby mama drama
Like 25 years
"*evade child support, I must. Ftfy"
"Die, I hope Yarddle will"
"Run them over more, I must. Become more minor, they will. Fuel my hatred, this does."
Apparently an admin didn't like it so they just kept banning any lego yoda subreddit.
"""Racism"" (people having too much fun making jokes about yoda hating minorities and ect)"
"A lot of memes about minorities and stuff like “despite making up only 13% of the population...” it wasn’t as bad as other subreddits and there were a lot of normal memes too but it was trending into becoming a subreddit like clownworld or whatever so an admin preemptively banned it.

Also a bit too many sexual Ashoka memes."
Reddit admins don't believe in free speech if they don't agree with the subject.
I mean it was extraordinarily explicit as far as the Ahsoka stuff
Devolved into an alt right edge lord cesspool
2001 Honda Civic I have
"Yeah, same. I’ve seen so many Yoda + Ketamine memes, if I don’t hear what’s behind it I just might have to buy ketamine."
"I looked it up on YT and this is what I found 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0448ZRHBfek&feature=share"
How would that get the sub banned lol
"I legit think the force just kind of...made him. Anakin and him were born in the same year, so I think the force went ""Oh shit things are about to get LIT, I think I better give the good guys a new hero unit in case they fuck it up"""
No they have two oficially confirmed sexes
"Pleased Allah, he has"
"There was a sub called lego Yoda, it was more or less /r/bertstrips just with Yoda being a ketamine addicted degenerate. It got banned after the posts started getting ridiculously racist, if I remember correctly."
How tf you on prequel memes but don’t know what LEGO  yoda is
On Alderaan Yaddle is. Destroy the planet you must.

Apparently an admin didn't like it ^because ^it ^was ^incredibly ^racist so they just kept banning any lego yoda subreddit.
"Considering there’s subreddits that advocate for far worse, that’s unfair to ban a subreddit for humor."
Just hearing that is hilarious. I only got to browse it a couple times and I feel like I missed out. Is there an archived version somewhere?
"Hating minorities and wanting to run them over. 

Because you know, that hasn't happened recently."
No such thing as free speech on a privately owned forum.
Examples?
It really didn't but I guess it's easy to spread lies about the sub now that it's banned
"Police, I have evaded. Taco Bell, I must go"
"It's just ironically portraying Yoda, an incredibly wise Jedi, as a ketamine addicted, anti-immigrant chav for comedy."
Lego Yoda hits rock bottom and becomes a ketamine addicted racist and occasional radical Islamist.
Same thing managed to get legoyoda banned
"I think the exact words were “LIT things will be, good guys fuck up they will. Provide new hero unit I shall.”"
Wasnt Anakin born of the will of Darth Plagueis and Palpatine? I wonder if baby yoda was born as a result of the light side of the force countering the dark side?
"I'm not up to date on star wars lore, isn't Yoda a tad bit older than Anakin? Like, by almost a millennium?"
Thanks!
Hey! I got more than one sub to keep track of!
"Holiday home home on Hosnian prime she has.

Chances I will not take."
"Been looking for the refuge sub, thanks"
This is wonderful
"Be careful though, these can count as sub ban evasion"
"ketamine, is this?"
Spam account... dont click it
Those posts were there from the beginning. Some admin just didn't like edgy content. The 2001 Honda Civic was one of the first and most prominent jokes there next to the ketamine.
"The Reddit TOS is there for the staff to point at when they don’t like something, and ignore when incel and Nazi subreddits are recreated for the 12th time"
That's the top post there on /r/legoyodareincarnated
"Offensive LEGO Yoda: Banned

Sub where people openly call for genocide and praise certain people for imprisoning immigrant children in concentration camps: A-OK!"
Thanks Reddit for being an open platform
"They were jokingly portraying yoda as a terrorist because theres this thing called comedic juxtaposition, or comic irony, where ya know, you attribute traits to things that you wouldn't expect. Like Yoda doing ketamine and Yoda being a fucking anti-immigration terorrist. A shitty image of Yoda commiting a war crime is similar to a film writer portraying similar awful things on the big screen. 

Maybe people were saying racist things, but making Yoda into a racist or a terrorist doesn't alone constitute a title of racist on acount of the posters themselves."
"At some point though “humor” turns into people unironically laughing about racism and just an edgy racist circle jerk. I loved r/gamersriseup 2 years ago when it everyone understood that it was explicitly making fun of racist”gamer culture” 4chan memes and the like, but now there are a bunch of people on there that think the n word is the punchline"
"I think the goal is to keep that part of reddit contained. They have t_d, and they can have their little meme subs pop up, but if they start to get too big they get banned. Can't have that stuff flowing into the rest of the site. Advertisers don't want to be part of that"
"The forum is a platform, not a publisher."

No thanks that’s why I unsubbed from there to begin with lol
Joking about killing minorities isn't right wing or edge lord? Guess I'm out of touch.
"This doesn’t make enough sense, so I bought ketamine

Edit: if y’all haven’t guessed, this was all an elaborate ploy to buy ketamine"
What happened?
"A pretty good fan theory about it:


https://youtu.be/tOevapbY-8I"
"The whole father thing really is stupid but it’s cannon now. 

Really shouldn’t have ever asked ‘who’s the father?’ It should have been completely up to interpretation. As it stands my interpretation is that she was wilding out real hard and just couldn’t remember who the father was and out of her embarrassment she just pretended her son was Jesus."
All I will say is if you plan on watching the new Disney + series the Mandalorian you really should avoid anything Star Wars related right now
On several planets in the system she could be. Destroy the whole system I must
"Inhale it, I must."
Im pretty sure it was there before ketamine jokes
"That's my point.  They were always there, but then they got more prominent.  On the last remaining Yoda sub they are current #1 overall, and #1 on Hot."
"Or, even more likely, far righters increasingly took that joke seriously and started actually calling for minorities to be killed.

Edit: cmon far righters, downvote me more, prove my point. Poor wittle you, being opwessed by the admins for being white and twying to save your wace from white repwacement"
"Sure, but I'm specifically referring to the rule that, once banned, it's pretty clear you can't just choose a similar name and start up again.  Thus ""they just kept banning any lego yoda subreddit"" isn't evidence of a conspiracy or anything, just standard policy."
Thanks for the new subreddit bröther
Baby's first comedic juxtaposition maybe.
"I understand maintaining that one to an extent since it deals with politics which is a whole other monster.  But there’s also like those anti pitbull subreddits where people have celebrated having shot and killed a pitbull. I get disliking a dog breed, but that just seems really toxic to me.

Fuck it though, I guess threatening to run over people in my 1998 Toyota Corolla while on Ketamine is despicable behavior"
"It might be optimistic to think it’s because of the persecution complex and not because it’s a huge sub whose ban would drive down site traffic.

Legoyoda size < negative appearance to advertisers

T_D size > negative appearance to advertisers

It’s simple as that. The rules don’t actually matter, and if you read mod discussions with admins that becomes very clear."
"They don't ban TD because the toxic users would spread to other subreddits, that why it's quarantined, that literally what quarantine means."
TD advocates for what exactly?
Is there any conspiracies that they won't believe?
You're being downvoted but you're 100% correct. The edgelords here just wanna make edgy and racist jokes and can't handle being told to quit their bullshit.
And what's published on a forum must follow its rules.
LOL that bad huh?
Joking is the keyword no one seriously believed that shit
It was banned.
"I know there's a yodaling in the mandalorian, but is that really yoda? Did they retcon his age? How was he the master of Qui Gon if he was 9 when they found Anakin?"
"go to allah, i must."
"I see. I just don't understand what's so bad about that. The people on this sub aren't terrorists, just like the people over at r/bertstrips aren't actual slave owners. They just like pairing an innocent image with edgy content. It's so clearly satire I really don't understand why Reddit is acting so much against it.

As a matter of fact, bertstrips is WAY worse than r/legoyoda was IMO."
"I mean, r/dogfree still exists. And I'd put EZ money on them celebrating not even just a pitbull, but any dog getting run over or something like that. 

r/Sino, a literal CCP propaganda sub is doing just fine too. But oh no we need to ban this sub about drinking water!"
When I read anti pitbull I thought you meant the artist and almost got happier than I should have..
r/mrworldwide must be stopped
"It’s also that that meme is just old. Obviously you can’t ban a subreddit for only using recycled memes, that would encompass most of the platform, but it’s just so... eh. That’s just my personal opinion though."
We shouldn't celebrate it but when one dog breed that makes up 6.5% of the dog population is responsible for 66% of lethal maulings maybe there is something we should look at fixing.
Maybe a little bit of both.
"Nah it’s because the sub acts like a quarantine itself, if you remove that sub the retards will pos their retardations on other subreddits instead and fuck up the site. Same shit happened on 4chan when they deleted /new because of racism and the rest of the site got flooded with racism, /pol was made as a quarantine by giving them their own niche to stay in afterwards."
^Why are you booing him? He’s right.
"The only Ashoka thing I know is Yoda being a sex trafficker, considering some of the other shit on Reddit that's pretty tame."
"eh by standard terms it wasn't THAT bad, I just generally dislike reading stuff like that. i suppose it was still funny, but i wasn't all that surprised by the ban"
It's not yoda. It's just easier to call it baby Yoda rather than a baby of Yoda's species which still remains unnamed
"Since you want to know, 

The Mandalorian is set 5 years after the fall of the Empire. In the first episode, the protagonist receives a contract from what is assumed to be a former Grand Moff for the empire. They want him to find and bring to them a being of which they cannot provide any data other than his age, which is 50 years old. The being of course is the Baby Yoda, and he's a separate entity from the Yoda we know from the movies, his species officially has no name and only a few of them exist in canon as of yet. That's pretty much all the information we have as of yet, it could be a clone of Yoda (Unlikely though), the son of Yoda and Yaddle - another Jedi of Yoda's species seen in The Phantom Menace (Less likely), or just a baby of that species born though random extraneous means, through the force or not. Yoda does officially have a homeworld in canon, we just don't know where it is and we've never seen it, so the baby could just be from that planet. We'll know more as the show progresses."
"It's the classic slide.  9 out 10 users are laughing at the jokes, having a good time.  That last guy legitimately thinks immigrants being hit by cars is good, and thinks he's among friends.  Over time the line blurs, and more of the latter start mixing it.

And eventually you end up with shithole subs.  I'm not saying the Yoda subs reached that point, but I don't exactly begrudge the Admins for acting as they did-- especially when the Yoda mods were notoriously absent."
Ok the earlier version of hydrohomies was banned literally just for having the n word I think
I’m surprised r/thefairersex and r/againstgaymarriage haven’t been banned
You're thinking of r/MrLocalNeighborbood
Bro don’t diss mr worldwide
"Fair point, it’s clear they’re a preferred breed by the wrong people. But that doesn’t mean neckbeard vigilantes should go out hunting people’s dogs."
Luke did i ever tell you about ahsoka
"I really don't believe that. Nobody is getting radicalised by a fucking Lego Yoda figure, just like nobody is becoming racist because of Big Bird in r/bertstrips. Why doesn't that sub get a similar treatment? It's full of racist, sexist, pedo jokes but somehow everyone seems to realise that's all satire. Why can't they do that with Lego Yoda?"
[removed]
r/againstgaymarriage is actually the good one that was created to spite the actual anti-LGBTQ one. The actual one had misspelled Against and was banned a few weeks ago.
Literally just saw a post there thats titled Dogs are the most dangerous animal in the world. Unironically. The dude was one of the cyclists who annoy every driver on the road. Anyway he compares them to tigers because they run and bark at him sometimes. He said he’s crashed because of it before and it makes me very happy to imagine that
r/subsifellfor
I never said I was for anything like that. I'm not. But it's more than just the wrong people. I wouldn't day this about any other breed but they are a much more violent breed. Sometimes they'll attack children they've known their entire lives. I'm just saying the sub is toxic and should be banned but there is a real concern there.
"I wouldn't argue many (or any) are radicalized, but that instead the ""crowd"" changes.  The regular folks get weirded out or just get bored of the lean towards alt-right stuff, and leave, as more weirdos come in.  That's why when the bans come the ""frequents these subreddit"" lists for most of the remaining users are often similar."
[removed]
[removed]
Brahh it wasn’t a “den of casual racism” it was just a bunch of people who love water. Go check out r/hydrohomies it’s exactly what it was like.
"Don't worry I didn't misinterpret what you said, I get it. I agree, pitbulls are a breed that should be taken seriously as owners since they could be dangerous. It's not a dog everyone can own."

I’m a little upset about this.
"Yet she pops out just wagging her tail. God dang, dogs are the sweetest beings."
I had to watch the video four times before I saw a dog! I kept thinking it would run out of someplace obvious... it didn’t.
BRING HIM INSIDE!
"""This adorable pup named Lily had a scare her doggie home toppled over during the wind/dust storm in #Victorville today, with her inside! Her owner says the dog was uninjured and was able to get out on her own. “I’m glad it was her, she’s fearless and wasn’t at all afraid. My others would have been traumatized,” said the dog's owner.""

Omg his reaction tho
760 baby
What a rude awakening
I like how he escaped out the emergency door like on a school bus.
"My Pongo loved the wind. He passed away a few months ago, but I used to Love watching him on windy days cuz he would just sit out in the open and let the wind blow over him like the women in those sexy hair commercials. Lol"
Too funny glad dog is good
Hark! Who goes there?
At the end he just says “well I guess this is my life now” and goes back inside.
Southern Cali?
Those are some solid chairs
Musta been some strong wind if it blew your lawn away
Good opportunity for r/animaltextgifs here
Poor thing shouldnt be out in it in the first place
I feel more bad that the dog has to live in that shitty backyard.
How the hell did the chairs not move?
Vegas?
Ahh fuck were still in Kansas. Maybe next time.
"The poor guy! Just earlier today I was thinking about my dog growing up, and one day someone left him outside when a giant storm came through. It knocked his dog house over and he panicked and tried to get out of the yard. My sister got home from school to find him in a terrible state. He never ever went back into that dog house after and we felt horrible. Now I just want to go pet and comfort that dog in the post. 

(And for the record, that was just one bad day out of many happy days. He was a well loved dog in my family of six, so he always was getting cuddle time. We knew how much we messed up that day.)"
"""what da hell is going on out here"""
It looked like a barbecue or a table at first.
Wrought Iron Patio Set: MAKE me move motherfucker
"""Auntie Em! Auntie Em!"""
Does the dog house have a door in the bottom just in case something like this happens and it blows over on the front?
Wait until he sees the witches ruby shoes sticking out.
The dog would go to what he feels safe and sheltered
I am just wundering how the table flew over but the grill with wheels did not even nudge?
# GET THAT GOOD BOI INSIDE
my heart stopped at the second watch when I knew there was a dog inside and the house tumbled
What kind of piece of shit would leave their dog outside in that
that windstorm huffed and puffed and blew her house down!
*puppy
Is that an escape door Incase it tips over or did he just pry it open?
He's so cute.
I hope that's not the dogs life.  Dog house sitting on a deck in what I guess is a dirt backyard.
Holy shit the grass blew away!
That's one healthy looking lawn you have there.
Is this backyard a dog prison yard?
Aaah poor pupper. Imagine taking a nap and your whole house turns upside down
Ruff
LET HIM IN
This is a dick move in any culture.
The top left and top right corners of this makes it look like this was filmed on/from the ISS...the yard looks like it could be mars.

He went from being a dog to being a gopher  real quick
Bring her inside!!
This is from Victorville CA right?
"""It fucken WIMDY!"""
Poor doggos. Was probably having a nice dream and sleep too
So you just left him out there?
What kind of owner has there dog in that yard ? Theres no protection from the elements
Who’s the asshole owner leaving the dog outside in a wind storm????
Looks like he just went back inside for a nap.
"He was stunned after the accident not knowing what just happened... He first checked the inside after the accident for structural damages. He then got out of the doggy house to check for damages on the exterior. He might need to call his insurance if he finds any damage. 

They’re raising such a responsible pup. Cheers!"
r/youseeingthisshit
I'm assuming metal and that the grill has a full propane tank.
wind passes through them
Holes
Wrought iron maybe.
"Me too! My heart, I just want to bring him inside!"
Pupset
I’m not. I smiled when his little head popped out.
If you know it’s going to be windy enough to knock your dog house over you should either move it somewhere with better protect or just bring the dog inside! Imagine if something had flown in and injured the dog!
This looks like typical yard in Rio Rancho New Mexico. Zeroscaped!
My yard looked like this right before we laid seed
nah i love being a turd
Looks like a new development and the owner just hasn't put the yard in yet.
They got chairs so they can sit there and admire their dirt and concrete
Looks like a typical new development southwest backyard.
"Maybe it's to remind the owner of prison, complete with 24 hour surveillance."
Boyz need some greenery innit
Wagging tail doesn’t always mean happy. I’ve known plenty of dogs that wag their tails when anxious.
That’s close to Mitt Romney level right there.
Ahh Victorville. It’s windy everyday!
"Apple valley here, today was trash day. Street absolutely covered in garbage and trash cans."
I had a feeling that was our lovely high desert wind storm today. I’m in Hesperia.  Another blustery day. Make way for the snow coming.
Victorville Gang
"I drove through today on the way from LA to Havasu, the state of the 40 put the small sandstorm on the 15 to shame, multiple overturned semis, 2 car distance visibility."
Why did they leave her outside???
"Oh boy they're gonna this Thanksgiving that's for sure. we're suppose to get 90% to 100% chance of snow*! The cajon pass is gonna be impossible this holiday lol

Edit: forgot the snow part!"
VVNG inspired me lmao
"Wait, the home of the Victorville Film Archive?? Hollywood needs to send aid down there stat and make sure no five baggers are damaged!"
Yeah looks like there’s an emergency door built into the bottom of the dog house so that if it flips on the entrance side the dog can still get out. Pretty awesome.
Bark*
"Yup, the High Desert had the worse dust/wind storm today because a big snow storm is blowing in for Thanksgiving."
There isn't even any grass. Just looks like packed sand or something.
Who says it doesn't live inside? You don't even know the owner and you're seeing 30 seconds of their 24 hr day. No animal lives outside in this area.
Nah Victorville
"Awww I'm so sorry your puppo had to go through that D: the owner said this dog took it like a champ, but her other dogs would've been traumatized"
"Some premade dog houses have bottoms that aren't attached, just slats that drop into place. When it toppled those slats fell forward creating a gap to squeeze through."
I’m guessing white painted metal. Because the plastic ones I thought they were would’ve flown away from a fart.
"Not my dog, but I bet the owner let him outside to use the bathroom and the dog decided to stay in its lil house."
"It's not my yard or dog, but it does have shelter? It's in a dog house and, if anything, you can't assume the dog has been out there for that long. The owners could have just let it outside to use the bathroom. Who knows, but there's definitely shelter and maybe even more out of view of the camera."
Everyday here is a wind storm. I couldn’t get my own dog it come in. Of course he was on the side of my house that has a lot of shelter.  This was worse than normal though.
Oh for fuck's sake. Dogs are just fine outside. They aren't made of paper mache.
"So they don't pee in your house dude. Letting a dog outside is fine especially when it has shelter. However, Forcing your dog to stay outside when they obviously don't want it or have no place to take shelter isn't fine. Animal cruelty is no joke and should not be lightly accused. It undermines what animal cruelty even is and disrespects animals who have been seriously abused."
Minus when he went outside to explore and the video suddenly cut out
At least he called nine-wuff-wuff
Dude
r/lostredditors
I'll cross post it right now
You should totally post it there
and propane accessories.
"I have a patio set that included an umbrella with a base made of pure concrete.  

After 1 spring storm, I removed the umbrella.  

After 2 spring storms, I just tipped the chairs upside down.  

After 3 spring storms I said fuck it, shit's gonna move where it's gonna move.  

And this was just basic-ass Nebraska."
Aerodynamic!
"Not about what happened to the dog, how the owners treat him,"
I’m guessing they didn’t know
"Not to mention most desert towns, but sure. Specifically Rio Rancho."
"Most of them have more sage after a while, this must be a recent property."
360 no scape
That's sexy.
At least is ain't my yard ya turd lol
"Wagging the tail is a way to release excess energy, regardless of emotion. :)"
Perhaps they should invests in something to weigh that house down
"Wind for breakfast, lunch, and dinner :D"
"Wind, meth, and dirt, it's the part of SoCal people like to forget about"
"Sooo, the owners know it’s windy like this every day, let’s just move the dog house close to the edge."
"Might have just let it out to pee, no one knows the whole story"
Oh no. All those people traveling are in for a rough ride. I used to teach at Hesperia HS and it was awful on that mesa; I’d get sand in my teeth! I was happy to escape the wind!
I know. I live in the high desert. Although I actually didnt get the storm.
"Do you remember about a decade ago, when there was insane winds that kicked up a dust storm on the 14 freeway going through Rosamond? Visibility dropped to zero and a bunch of people slowed way down or stopped right on the freeway instead of pulling over (they couldn't even see where ""over"" was), while others just continued doing 80 mph. It caused a huge pile up with dozens of cars. I was working in the ER at AV hospital that day. I have never seen so many ambulances in my life. As soon as a rig dropped off a patient they headed right back out to pick up another one. Obviously, people died. It was one of the most surreal events in my life. So much tragedy. Whenever we get wind storms like this, it brings me right back to that day. I haven't experienced anything like that in the ER since. These wind storms are something else. Anyway, just felt like sharing I guess. I'm glad the pup is ok."
"In the high desert it’s difficult to get grass to stay alive, and to top it all off our lawn watering was restricted not too long ago due to the Cali drought. Not much the owners can do on that front"
"I’m glad to hear it. This was about 20 years ago and I STILL feel bad about it. We had him since I was in first grade until I was in college, so we were best buddies."
And more obnoxious
Oh ok!
It was a quick nap.
Take your damn updoot and get out.
r/canyoubelievethisthing
Yup...
Dammit Bobby
"Not wrong lol, except we actually have grass"
"There's no context, maybe they have a doggy door and he chose to be outside."
"He’s in a closed off area with a cool-ass dog house that he was having a nice nap in. The owner’s are monitoring the area by camera to make sure he’s safe, I’m assuming. 

What makes you think the dog is mistreated without knowing basically any context other than what is shown?"
How dare they have other priorities besides making sure their dog doesn't get hit with air particles
You can't expect this to happen. Not the owners fault.
"given that its a really good pun, yes."
You should see my back area then
\*flush\*
Karma turd
I live down the hill but I’m up there to see family often! Weird to see people post on the internet from around the same areas lol
"So it’s definitely windy everyday, but not to this degree! I feel like this windstorm in SoCal kind of came out of the blue today!"
Its not windy every day. You understand how weather works right?
The dream of escaping this dust bowl amiright? I'm currently going to VVC and school was a nightmare today. A total dust storm and I couldn't even see bear valley from the campus because of the incoming storm. I never saw it this bad in all my life living here. You definitely aren't missing much!
"Dang, it was so bad here that you couldn't see main roads like phelan and bear valley. Hell I couldn't even see the road next to my house lol"
I remember when that happened.  That's exactly what today reminded me of also.
"I'm not the owner, but I bet the pup was outside to pee cuz the owner has a few other dogs who aren't outside."
My dog has a super comfy bed next to me in the bedroom; but would 100% sleep in his outdoor house if I let him.
"Well, for me it isn't so much that I think the dog is generally mistreated, and more that it's been left outside in a windstorm with gusts strong enough to knock the doghouse off the porch while the dog is inside. The dog might get hit by debris or something."
How they keep him outside in intense winds is what I meant
That's what's called a pro gamer move.....when you zigged he reversed zigged
That's kinda gay...
You should tell them to bring there dog inside
"Happened here in Vegas too. Was super calm all day and wind got crazy around noon, it's probably because it's gonna rain soon"
"Ok.........soooooo, lets still put the doggo on the edge of glory, right? Right. Makes perfect sense."
I have no real idea what place on Tatooine you people are from but y'all sound like sand people to me.
Same. My old dog (passed away) LOVED concrete. No joke I had 3-5 beds for him all over and he was welcome on my bed... where did he sleep? The porch. I try to inflict my beliefs onto animals but they just aren't human as much as we want them to be. Sigh.
Dogs aren't some special snowflakes with needs like you.
Why? I don’t know them lol
"Yeah that’s how it was here! You’ll probably be getting snow after the rain, yeah? Weather shows snow for us in SoCal on thanksgiving!"
"Same report here in NorCal. We were supposed to go to the mountains for Thanksgiving, but now there’s 2 feet of snow coming."
"Ok get your “he’s an outside dog” attitude out. They still deserve better, and yeah they can be in harsher conditions but they can still be miserable"
Lmaoo
Rain for the city and nice fluffy snow up in Mount Charleston for Thanksgiving
What part of no context is hard to understand
"You've led a very sheltered life, I see."
Dogs are more adapted to being outside than you're.
Who said anything about him being an outside dog? Sensitive much? You don't even have any context. Can't imagine getting that worked up over a clip with no context.
"You're fighting a losing battle, buddy. A lot of cultures like in India and the US think it's okay to treat social animals like dogs as cattle. 

When my sister moved to the US and rescued two dogs, the woman from the shelter cried when she heard she wasn't American and said ""at least they will be treated well."""
Comment
Why did I just watch this 94 times?
"Well then... I have almost hit a deer while biking home from class. It ran across multiple lanes of traffic before dashing in front of me to get to cover. Me and someone else in a car just stopped for a second I guess both thinking ""wtf just happened?"""
Oh deer.
"At Tussey Mountainback in 2010, the lead woman in the 50 miler championships had a collision with a deer on the course. She had to have medical but still crushed the 1st women’s."
F
"This must be some sort of Russian Roulette-esque game the deer play that involves crossing major roadways at full speed without looking.  I imagine his buddies are all watching from the clearing like, ""Nope. Chuck failed. Who's next?"""
"“Aight, imma head out”"
My eyes got 10x bigger than they normally are upon watching this. Like a train wreck that I cant stop watching.
Live in the poconos...this exact scenario is so common the cops just call a tow and ask if you want the deer.you dont even have to stay at the scene if you get a ride.
"I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky"
Why the heck did that deer just banzai the car?
But did his shoes fall off?
"am I the only one who thought that someone in the passing car threw a cat at the cyclist?

yes? ok, carry on then."
BAMbi.
"I hit a deer in this exact manner with a civic. The deer flew exactly the same way. I was driving on a very straight secluded road with a corn field five feet off the road. 

The corn was high and I was going around seventy mph. Didn’t even touch the brakes. Deer jumped out and it hit the front corner of the car. 

I’ll never forget the image of it flying in the air after impact. There was luckily no bicyclist’s best by when this happen. Fd to my car badly"
They had no eye deer.
"Right before the GIF ends, there’s a yellow sign. I have to wonder... is it a deer crossing sign?"
That dude was solely trying to record the biker chick's ass.
"If we're being honest the odds of this happening is pretty high, still a cool post though"
The rag doe physics in this game are wild.
"I’m in Texas as we have so many deer here. You have to be careful driving down the road. The deer literally wait for a car to pass by to suicide themselves, or to see if they can outrun it. I’ve had many close calls just like the video."
HOLY SHIT
"At first I was like ""oh no, the guy in the yellow!""

Yeah deer literally never get hit by a car /s
The girl did not narrowly escape. The camera guy riding behind did.
"i mean the odds of a dear getting hit by a car is probably pretty high, happens all the time"
The new bambi movie looks lit
Lol
Same thing gonna happen to you cyclist. Ride a bike path or something. If traffic is coming I ain't moving over. Suck it.
"Don’t stop now, you fool."
Good to know I'm not the only person who laughed... Probably
Those are rookie numbers

I think they're already about to cross then the sound of an approaching car scares them into just saying fuck it I'm going now. Truly a wonder how the species exists at all.
"No, you just don't see the hundreds of times when they don't run out infront of anything"
"I hit a dear exactly like this. Zero reaction time, honestly never saw it. Hell I thought my engine or something had exploded."
"I dunno, we're the ones speeding through their natural habitat in big metal machines."
They just do it. I lived in the snow with a 4runner and was going downhill at night and saw lights from the left turn on like motion sensor lights. Then a buck aimed right at me. Put a fat dent in my rear quarter panel and ran off.
Deer eyesight isn't great at judging speed or distance. That's why you cover your scent if you hunt them because their smell is their go to sense at farther ranges. Now if someone would just educate the deer as to the scent of cars and trucks maybe we wouldn't have this happening multiple times a year. Can we get some tax funding for wildlife education? They don't have to know it's for educating the deer until after we spend it.
Nope. Same. I thought either a car was hit or thrown and was super sad. Then I saw it was a deer but sadness was the same.
You’re telling me that the odds of biking past a deer getting hit by a car and capturing it on video is pretty high? I think you’re pretty high

"They spent tens of thousands of years evolving to evade bears and shit, you'd think they wouldn't actively run into a clearing and slam themselves head first into a car as much as possible."
That deer was definitely moving!
"Ok...here is an absolutely foolproof plan to stop deer from hitting cars.

Collect a bunch of sweat from hunters. Put the sweat in jars around roads. The deer smell hunters and avoid the roads.

Hmm...i mean this was meant as a joke but something similar could actually work"
That sounds like they're evolved to be aware of ambush predators. So are we waiting for mountain lions to evolve traits to make them more like rhinos?
A female deer
Bambi's Mom live action
But it's only been 100 years since cars have been made. You're comparing thousands/millions years of evolution to a century lol.
I like the joke but yeah it might actually work. I know gardeners who save their hair clippings after they get it cut then they spread it around their garden to keep rabbits and squirrels out.
Do we really need to wait? With the gene editing and modification available using Crispr 9 techniques that already exist we could literally make that happen. We're even capable of helping people realize when something is a joke nowadays. If you got the joke then I apologize for not getting yours and if you didn't then I ask you to not turn this into some contest.

You may have to solder in a new battery soon so he can keep saving. Dont fret its very easy. Super cool gift!
You may wanna change out the save battery soon. The expected life on those things was 12 years

""This is worse than you making me listen to Nu Metal.""

""You will listen to Linkin Park and you will love it!"""
I don't think that's what he meant when he asked for the new pokemon game
Won’t the gameboy cartridge battery die soon since it’s been 20 years?
"""Thanks dad, you cheap fuck!"""
"And he probably played it for 5 minutes and was like ""Ok cool dad"", then went back to fortnite on his phone."
Did you cry when he deleted your save to start his own adventure?
"""Dad why can't you just let me play Fortnite with my friends or any other modern game"".

""No son, sit your ass down and experience my own nostalgia even though I would have played the same games as you if they were available to me at the time""."
"No, you can't go back to your computer and play fortnite with your friends. Now sit still and play the damn game, daddy needs his internet points."
Here son hold this old console so I can get some internet points
Old console are cool and all but i wouldn't be surprised if the kid only used it once. Old gaming used to suck massive ass.
Gameboy. Pokemon. Found somewhere. Still works. Karma. That's the magic formula.
"The moment you realize ""20 years ago"" is 2000."
"Dayum, that red light itself brings back so much memories. Putting in new batteries to see it lit bright red made me so happy."
"I still have my ds games cartridge with most of the saves from when I was a kid, it's crazy when you see the dates."
Be thankful your parents haven't moved 50 times and thought enough of you to hold on to some of your old stuff. Really cool you were able to do that.
I thought the batteries in all these (which powered the memory of save files) all died in 2015 or something if you didn't replace them?>
How did the cartridge not run out of battery yet?
I find this so hard to believe when my Pokemon Gold cartridge with a 251 pokemon save ran out of battery 5y+ ago.
Usually when the batteries go out so do the saves. Should probably change that.
"This sounds really cool in nostalgia-speak. But then I thought, that would be like my parents giving me  an old Atari Pong game for my 7th bday when my friends were playing NES. It would suck"

Thank you sir, now I feel fking old"
Was this...his only gift?

I wish my parents got me a basement for my 7th birthday
Yeah don't let the batt die! You loose everything
"Please, please...fix his posture now that he's young.

If he sits and play like this, there is an high chance he's gonna have neck and knees issues soon"
"Full of shit, the batteries only last 15 years"
"calling bullshit sorry that battery is dead

good job op i guess this is an ad for the new pokemon game"
Get him a gameboy color for the sake of his eyes. There is no backlight on the original gameboy and it's hard to see stuff sometimes
It must have been hard to let him start a new save
I'll never forgive nintendo for not backlighting the gameboy. Years with a worm light. I will never be the same.
That's awsome! This is actually how I started gaming too. My uncle gave me his old gameboy that he and my other uncle shared as kids! Came with motocross maniacs

Because that is what awesome dad's do.
That's really awesome.  I think it's amazing that you're sharing that love with your son in a way I wish my dad had.  But RIP your save file.

Op is full of shit. Everyone knows Pokemon blue never worked
Make him endlessly wonder about the truck like we had to
This does put a smile on my face
Wow
"DO NOT SOLDER BATTERY

Pokémon blue and red use Eepram memory which means it can last indefinitely, unlike yellow, gold and silver. You also don’t need to solder for gold and silver, there’s a place where the battery can be placed with a piece of tape. Here’s a guide: https://howchoo.com/g/ody3ztq0ywe/how-to-change-your-game-boy-game-cartridge-battery"

Can you let us know your main 6 Pokemon?
"I can't give my son my old original Gameboy (damn older brother took mine when he broke his by taking the battery cover off of his and putting it on mine, even though mine had my initials on the side), but my parents bought me a color at a yard sale. I still have my gb color and games, and it's his favorite color (green). I like to think that he'll be excited to play it.

He's on break this week, so I think I should bring it out of the closet."
I have a talkboy from home alone but no son. Only sun
You found a kid in your basement ?
You found a kid with a gameboy in your Parents Basement ?
Damn I wish I still had mine to give to my son.
Dat backlight doe (or lack thereof)
20 years ago.. god I'm old.
"When I was about 7 or 8, my big brother approached me with a green GameBoy Color and a copy of Pokemon Gold. 

I carried that thing with me for years, and loved every minute of it. I still have it to this day. I should probably get one of those backlit screens put in, some fresh batteries and start using it again"

Hold the fuck up. Pokémon blue was 20 years ago!?!?
Very cool! I've still got my colour and my advanced. He'll I've still got the bendy light that plugs into it.
It may soon go into the museum
"I bet he asked ""What is it?"" before you gave it to him."
Fond memories of hanging my arms over the end of the couch so I could use the lamp as light.
"No, don't say it's 20 years old! You're going to fucking kill me. Like speaking my true name, I'm going to rapidly age in an instant and turn to dust."
So you're a re-gifter is what you're saying xD
You found a child in your parents basement? I think you shouldn't give it to your son
God damn I wish I still had mine. Turrican and Super Mario Land were my favourites. And talespin!
I thought you were talking about the kid for a second.
You should post this in r/oldschoolcool too
And you didnt think to post your squad!!!!!
You are a good man
Turn the lights off and he'll learn the struggle.
"I think it'd be really cool to raise a young kid interested in games progressively through several eras of games as they age. So when they're super young, they start off with pong, and go forward from there until they eventually get to modern games in their teens."
Don't give me good old childhood flashbacks.Major missing :(
Screen still as dark as I remember it.  Do that kid a favor and mod in a backlight!
Weren't the memory batteries in those cartridges set to die a couple years ago?
I would give my arm for this
"This was the shit. They tested it against a flamethrower and even after burning, it still worked."
Do you really want your son growing up to be you?
This shiz makes me feel old
"Right, cause he will totally keep playing that."
I thought you were talking about the child lol
babay playing
I hope you got him a real gift after that
I dug mine out awhile back.   It's pretty much unplayable.  The sun light ruined the screen.
"Wish I'd of kept all my classic gear, parents were of the mindset that one is enough and would need to pass on older console before I was allowed a new one."
I miss the old gameboy
How old are you OP?
Still reminds me of the time when I deleted my brothers Pokemon blue save with a 151 Pokemon. He forgave me eventually...
I missed out on so many common pop culture just because I bought me a C64 in 1984.
Common timmy play on the gameboy so i can get internet points or no dinner for you again
Legendary :)
"In a sense, it is like you were actually playing the game 20 years ago."
A really cool and moving gift! I hope he makes just as many fond memories of the game as you have!
Damn you found a child?
"If this was my kids, they would delete the save file within 10 mins of touching it. That's just what they do."
"My dad used to do CD backups of his laptop every few months, I found some in deep storage and was going through it and found out original chicken invaders 2 save file from 2006!"
Respect
This is the most normal post I've seen in a while
"I feel like it is a shitty gift. It holds a value to you, but your parents didn't give you their toy from when they were 7.

I know people like to see passing down previous generations treasures, but it is a kid, give him something he can have on his own, since what you gave him is easily replaced by anything on a phone now. Don't be cheap."
I've got the Donkey Kong game and watch. It still works and is in perfect condition.
Now THAT folks is some good fathering.
"Gave my kids my old snes with a bunch of games, they lost interest after an hour  Oh well I still play it"
What‘s his name?
How many times did your kid ask why there's no touch screen or backlight?
I heard a rumour that Focus Energy did the opposite of what it was supposed to on the original games. Can anybody confirm this?
"Fuck man, this made me remember my old 15 year old PS2 memory card that my stupid 4 year old cousin destroyed."
That file is going to delete itself very soon. The save battery just died in mine. My entire file just completely gone
Mod it with a backlit screen. Makes it much better to play with.
My mom gave me hers when I was 13 (I'm 16 now) and she also had blue. I would play on it for hours.
How wholesome!
"A few years ago I went through and completed the 151 dex legit minus the Mew glitch. Fuck you Chansey, Pinsir, and Tauros."
"&#x200B;

Wow"
now this is epic
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I want mine back.
I remember I was at my dick friends house for a barbeque and I brought over my trading cable because he wanted to see it. And he told me to go outside and eat and we'll play. When I came back that fucker stole my leveled up Charizard. His mom overheard us yelling and made him give it back. He then ran in his room and cried for the rest of the barbeque.
At some point you played with it for the last time and didn't even realize it
This is the way.

He will grow up becoming a real man
Thank goodness there's no Fortnite 20 years ago
"I can't stand to play on those anymore. Found my old one at my parents last year, tried to play but really it's just killing my eyes, I can't get through this shit again"
"Mystic Quest, best game boy game ever."
"Why is my blue still working too? Cause the rest of my cartridges aren't file saving anymore. I know, I know, it is the battery[which can be replaced]. But why was it blue. Surely I had to play it just as much. I did play red alot doe"
This is wild! Seeing my daughter catching her first Pokemon on Go was a crazy moment for me.
"Oh sweet, you can transfer your bulbasaur right up to the latest gen... oh wait."
Wholesome !
Awesome! I loved Gameboy. I remember the release.
Nice.
"Fuck, I’m am so envious of you right now. I had a save file on my Yellow which had a bunch of Pokémon from Blue and Red. One day I forgot it before going on vacation. A literal nightmare as a 10 year old. 

I came home like 10 days later and I had left it running and it burnt out."
"Wow that is pretty amazing that you found a gameboy original with Pokémon blue in it a game that isn’t compatible with the system, and was not only able to play it but still able to load your old save too. Man those odds are almost as low as what some people will do for a trending post, nice!"
"Cool gift, but in all likelyhood he probably thinks it sucks; games have come a long way since and I doubt he'll truly appreciate it until he's older."
This rules. I got my Charizard to level 100 on Pokémon red when I had my gameboy. That was before the chest code too.
"stiiiiiiiiill single, no kids

game boy is still around tho"
I'm really surprised that your son is actually playing it. Other kids would just throw them away like it's trash.
Was there a GameBoy Color/advanced that had the classic skin or was pokemon compatible with the classic? Because that doesn't look like the ones I thought could run pokemon.
Doesn't first gen pokémon only work on gameboy color/advanced?
yooo buy a new for him and when he is ready you can battle eachother
Man it is so cool seeing fathers giving their sons gaming stuff they used to use <3
*parents’
Seeing pics like this where people find their old gaming devices from back in the days and giving them to their kids makes me fucking angry at myself that I never kept my old gaming devices that I got from my dad as a young kiddo. I wish I could give my son my old Playstation 1 and Gameboy Color but their probably somewhere in Africa on a electronic junkyard or already disassembled and the parts live on now in other electronic devices.
"Oh God I got a blast of nostalgia from this. Does it even qualify as nostalgia if I'm only 18? Either way, I remember playing on my FB advance SP (the orange and green one) and trying to get as far as I could in Pokemon Silver because I didn't know how to save. Always picked Cyndaquil though!"
They just don't make quality things like this anymore.
"If he deletes it you delete him, ok"
Still better than sword and shield.
Holy F word that’s amazing
*sheds tear*
" I remember being around 12 years old, coming back home from a school camping trip on a ferry

Dude in my class was playing Pokémon blue, so I asked him if I could trade something I have for his game. Ended up getting it for a sandwich

Year 13 rolls around and I’m sitting in McDonald’s and I find the cartridge and gameboy in my bag, untouched for maybe a year and a half. Gave it to a friend of mine for $10 and 20pc McNuggets 

Always wonder if he passed it on to another friend... maybe I’ll see if I can buy it back this weekend or something"
cool to see him on that and not fortnite
I'm still looking for am Atari part
Noice
Definition of legacy.
*cries in gameboy bleeps and bloops*
my boyfriend when he gave me his game boy to play Pokémon for the first time (which was recently)
"Even though I'm a zoomer, I really hope no one says ok boomer"
I just did the same thing a few months ago. There is nothing quite like having a moment of nostalgia that your children actually appreciate in the same way. It's an awesome feeling.
That is SO GODDAMN AWESOME!
Had to do that with my silver. Good as new!
"Also, get a USB cart reader to dump the save if it hasn’t already been overwritten. You can get the 3DS virtual console games to read it and transfer your OG Pokémon up as far as (Ultra) Sun/Moon."
The saving thing was a battery issue? Kid me thought my pokemon crystal was just busted.
"Yeah it's amazing its lasted.  

My red version went flat when I was about 10 maybe? I had 150/151 (had mew, but goddamn tauros still evading me).  

Then one day I turned it on and it was blank.  

Tears were shed. I had a level 54 Bulbasaur."
It will lose your save though
"How do I do this without losing the current save? I got the highscore on this Frogger machine, but the pizza place  where it's located is closing down, I just went ahead and bought it, but I've just realized that it's a logistical nightmare to move it without losing power and to keep my highscore."
"I played some of my Gameboy games the other day for the first time in a long time and my Pokemon Red and Yellow saves still worked, but my Silver, Gold and Crystal were all dead. Do the gen 1 games last longer?"
I just checked my R/B/Y versions. They still work and I have never had to replace the batteries (yet). S/G I've had to replace at least twice. Switched to SS/HG.
"I read this as ""sonder"" and was forced to.consider this very intently for a moment before damn...  Overthinking it"
"don't even need to solder tbh. The battery is only held in with glue (?) or maybe two tiny tack welds. Not really sure, but I did nothing to my battery and it stayed in place with just the cartridge cover back on."
"This was the best game ever, we were happy kids with a better childhood than our child have now... Sad but true"
I just put a little strip of electrical tape around the new battery and the contacts and it works perfectly (since I have no solder iron.
"If he's anything like my nephews... you won't have to bother.

It'll be interesting to him for all of 30 minutes and then it's ""boring and old""

Le sigh lol"
Fairly certain blue and the other first-gen games did not have a battery. The day/night mechanic was introduced in second-gen (gold/silver) and the battery was needed to keep track of the time while the Gameboy was off.
That happened to my Pokémon Yellow cartridge.
"I recently found and fixed my original Game Boy.

Was sad to see my Silver/Gold saves gone, but Link's Awakening still had them."
Ahh yes. Back when the expected life span of a piece of electronics wasn’t a year..
"They'll still lose the save even if you change the battery before it technically dies. So either way, the save will be lost, but backups are possible."
"I had a Link's Awakening cartridge that would erase my save periodically. I now know why. Little embarrassed I didn't think of that sooner, although I suppose I haven't really given it much thought since I was like 7 years old."
That's what she said
So you need the power to read/write or to store it?
He should try get a refund.
"If you want to prank your adult siblings this Christmas, hop on Amazon and order a bulk package of transparent bricks. Then wrap them up and covertly stick the box under their Christmas tree for their kids.

Just reading that gave me a panic attack.
Once your getting used to the Legos you start to lift your feet only a few milimeters so instead of stepping on them your foot just pushes them.
That’s the 2 year olds fault

""When I was your age we would go to a windowless room and just game in the dark!"""
Probably got a better one and doesn't even realize it
It's long past dead because OP is lying for karma.
That's only for gold and silver i believe because they used a system that tracked time even when the game was off
"He is actually upset it isn’t backlit, he has a 3ds already."
this is such a boomer thing to say
I'd play for five minutes then install an emulator on my phone and play it there instead without developing eyestrain.
You'd be very surprised.  Kids have a sense of history about these things now thanks to infinite retro vloggers.  Playing with the real thing can be an experience.
Ok boomer
"He hasn’t yet, probably will tomorrow while I am at work."
"As someone who intended to have their kid play NES and Game Boy (if I ever have kids), this is too real"
I refuse to believe a child this age would actually be interested in playing a Gameboy in 2019.
You can’t even play red and blue on the brick gray gameboys so... yes this post was a hot lie lol
Wait.. i am going to be an adult? Damn
Biggest mood right here.
This is the way.
D:
Still have my copies since release and they are all fine.  100+ hours on each one.
GBC wasn't backlit either.  Nintendo handhelds didn't get lit screens until the Advance SP.
"*flashbacks to the worm light*

The past was awful."
Nice. Still got the walkthrough mags for ff6 advance and tactics a2. I will finish one day
Get an R4 or similar of you'd like to be able to load ROMs on it. Much easier than tracking down physical copies.
"More or less. The ones that had a real time clock in them (e.g. Pokemon Gold and Silver) are definitely dead by now. My red edition and some other cheap games still had their saves last year, but are probably bound to die soon."
I remember giving myself a good kink in my neck all the time from balancing a flashlight there so I could play in bed. Good times
"That's fixable, you just need to replace the burned polarizer. But it's kinda tedious to carefully peel it off and clean off all the glue from the screen."

Good on ya for having a kid and sharing an interest with them. Honestly not always as easy as it sounds"
You could literally never transfer from those gameboy games beyond gold and silver anyway you smooth brained circlejerker
I prefer a smaller Pokedex and wish they had cut even more Pokémon. My old Pokémon are still right there on my old saves.
F
The original Pokémon games were specifically designed for the original Game Boys.
Pokémon 1st and 2nd gen could run on the classic. 3rd gen was only advance
Why would you want to give your kids old things? They sucked. The kids arent going to enjoy them.
But you will lose the current save FYI.
"My Silver save is already gone.

It is the game that I derived my online name for over a decade and a half now. Still one of the best games I have ever played."
"YOU CAN GET OG RED POKEMON TO DS? WHAT?

BLASTOISE HOLD UP BABY I'M COMING"
Is this done through CFW and injecting the save?
"What, how do I do that? I wanna save my Blastoise"
"Yup, they have a cr2032 in them and when it dies storage contents are lost when the gameboy shuts off or very soon after. Some games had semi transparent cartridges you could see the battery in If you hold it up to a light."
"It turns out that the batteries on 2nd gen pokemon games died out way sooner than 1st gen because of the game's clock. Basically, the battery had to keep running to update the cart's internal electronic clock. This is why the day/night feature got removed in Gen 3 on GBA and returned in Gen 4, where the games could read the clock on the DS itself."
"Oh yeah, I had 151/151 on blue. Lots of time spent catching, training, trading with friends for some I couldn't catch. One day a couple years after having last played it, I turned it on again, I think to see if I could transfer a couple old team members to gold/silver .. nothing. Sad day."
"Quite funny, Pokémon Gold and Silver are arguably the best games in the series yet they don't have any of the modern graphics or mechanics. I wouldn't think that made them boring. Maybe kids just like different games now though"
"They did have a battery, it is required to save. Older carts (gen1/2) used SRAM to store save data which needs to be constantly powered, as opposed to GBA carts which used Flash memory for saves but needed a battery for the real time clock."
"They did have one. The memory on the card isn't stable so it has to be kept ""fresh"" by the battery. But I think the battery life of the cartridge went significantly down when they added the real time clock component. My Pokémon Crystal game that I found in the basement recently was definitely dead and needed a battery swap before I could save again."
"Nintendo didn’t switch to Flash memory for handhelds until the Gameboy Advance

Even then, not right away, because early copies of fusion use Volatile memory, but by the time the 3rd generations Pokémon games came out, they’d made Flash standard"
"If they had a save mechanic that didn't involve entering a code to load your game, then yes it had a battery to hold the save data.

In short you are wrong.

The day night cycle(RTC) has nothing to do with general save data."
And all of my N64 cartridges/memory cards.
I had a surfing Pikachu. I better check if my yellow's battery still works.
"I have an old grey Link's Awakening cart that doesn't even have an ESRB rating on it, and the last time I checked it was still holding onto saves."
In gaming? Stay away from Microsoft and your still right. And the Switch. Otherwise most of Nintendos and Sony's shit historically has lasted 5-10 years no problem and iffy issues past that.
Not if you don't disconnect the old battery before putting in a new one. Should be possible with some wire and solder.
That's not a prank. That is a legitimate reason for war.
Calm down Satan
But then you end up stubbing your toe on something.
What holiday are you celebrating lol
"Haha, git fukt for using the proper plural!"
"They all have legendaries!

/s"
"Gameboy doesn't have a lit screen, so playing with it in the dark will be quite a challenge."
More like glue your face to the window of a car trying to see by passing streetlights while you played. The joy of the SP when it came. The pure unadulterated joy.
[What makes you think OP is lying?](https://imgur.com/a/X1EoUgV)
Not true at all. I still have saves from 20+ years ago on Super Mario World.
exactly
"Not true, my yellow saves."
"No. Gen 1 and 2 both had batteries for save data. The battery needed is a CR2025. If you look it up, you will find that it's a replacement battery for both generations. 

For Gen 3, it was optional because the save data was not volatile and always needing power. Berries would stop growing tho."
The old games are available on the 3ds also for pretty cheap considering the amount of nostalgia they bring
"The tiny screen and lack of back lighting are definitely a turn off, it's crazy how you look at the older consoles and you're like ""I used to put up with this?"" Also just an fyi you can buy a kit that will let you add a back light that doesn't take much know how and is pretty cheap."
Need an sp
hack it for him and put some emulators on there
"I'm not surprised. A good game is a good game, regardless of the graphics or sound. And there are many fun indie games out there with graphics and sound no better than the GBA, many of them designed to evoke the nostalgia of 80s and 90s games. I'm sure many kids today have seen and played games like that. The worst thing about the GB is how hard it is to see. Luckily, GB games can be plugged into a GBA SP, which is backlit, so if you have one of those your boy is golden."
Pick him up a GBA:SP and grab him Crystal and Emerald to go with it.
Get him one of those sweet little curly street lamp lights! Those were so much cooler than backlights.
"I'll be honest, all of the nostalgia filled nerds here may be circle-jerking about how much they'd ""love this present"" but in reality any normal 7 y/o kid would be disappointed if their only birthday present was a 20 year-old gaming system. I'm assuming you didn't actually just give him that for his birthday though and that he probably got something else too, but just felt like I had to say it since everyone else in this thread seems to be deluding themselves as to what ordinary 7 y/o's actually want."
"It's true though, as cool as the old gameboy is I'd rather play on something backlit, not brick shaped and doesnt require 4 batteries."
I was born in ‘88 and played Pac-man all the time when I was a kid without vloggers (whatever the fuck those are). Kids having a “sense of history” as you put it ain’t nothing new.
go pick up another copy
"Dude, *I'm* not even interested and I'm 32. Looking at that simply makes me appreciate how far games have come. Plus Red and Blue were buggy as fuck."
Why? You never played retro games when you were a kid?
Pokémon Crystal was the first one to require a newer system. All the others were fully backwards-compatible up to that point.
The Game Boy Pocket Light in Japan had a backlight then they released the Color and for some reason took the backlight out
Lmaooo..
"Well damn, I never knew. Cool!"
"They sucked? I guess we can't all share the same excitement for the gaming consoles that came out over 20 years ago.

But in my case, they are the reason I had a good childhood even though it wasn't ""good"". I got bullied in school, my parents were raising me with beatings. In turned out fine and both things weren't happening excessively but some kids break from that. My gaming devices gave me happiness in hard times and shaped my into the person I am today besides other things in my life.

I want my son to see how gaming was back then and how it evolved today so he can understand and appreciate it more, instead becoming one of those kids that get the newest gaming devices and when you show them old stuff they think it comes from the year 1503 instead from 1995."
"You don't *have* to, but it's by far the easier method."
"you can temp attach another battery to the terminals, swap the button cell, then remove the temp battery, no loss of data :)

edit: don't use a singular AA or AAA as the normal button cell is twice the voltage."
"Buy 2 replacement batteries, they're cheap, alligator clip one (backup battery) to the terminals, remove old battery, install new battery, unclip backup battery. 

You might need to solder on posts depending on which gen your cart is. 

Source: I used to do this for side money."
"Wonder what the life of the memory chip is without power? 

I also wonder if there is a niche market for devices that change the battery without dropping voltage?"
You may wanna change out the save battery soon. The expected life on those things was 12 years
Which really sucks....i have so much nostalgia in my blue version..
"That's what he said, good as new!"
"if you have a nintendo 64, a nintendo 64 flash cart (an everdrive64 or ED64+ will work) and a gameboy transfer pack you can back up the save file"
If you solder on some leads and apply 3V to it while removing and replacing the battery you'll keep that data ;)
"Yeah, unless you replace the battery while the device is running, which isn't easy. But I wonder, how could the battery last for 20 years?"
I assume there's some method out there for making a backup to a computer?
"If you connect another battery to the terminals of the old battery (with some wires) while you take the old one out and replace it, the save will be okay. Connecting a battery like this (in parallel) doesn't alter the voltage across the board, so the current drawn is the same, basically resulting in ""voltage bypass surgery""."
Ofcourse it is.
i was so sad when i couldn't pick up where I left off after 15 years
Pokémon Crystal being one of those.
"Crystal version would at least stop the clock when it got low to keep the save as long as it could, though

Or at least My cartridge did in a one in a million fluke"
Same thing killed Sega batteries. That RTC is a hungry part.
"I really do hate the attitude of “kids these days don’t like anything unless it’s shiny and new”

Unless the game is like, really clunky or the visuals are legitimately *bad* a lot of kids won’t care

My youngest brother loves a Link to the Past, and he played that coming right off of Link between Worlds"
"Go back and play the old version again. I think it was good back then because it was the best that was available. I don't think it holds up very well, but that's only because of the inventory system imo. The mechanics and story and such are still solid. HG/SS is the perfect upgrade for those games."
For me it was mind blowing finding out >!there was an entirely new map to explore!<
"Imagine if Pokémon had a code saving system. A one line code to save each of your Pokémon, another line to save your item bag and another for yourself current map location and quest history, your be typing codes all day"
Oh no... But mario had 119 stars.. NOOOO!
"I wasn’t aware the 64 used Volatile memory

I was 99% sure they used Flash"
All of my very heavily used N64 gear and games still work - wonder what you and I did differently.
Does that one use a battery to keep saves?
"That's why you tag it, ""from Santa,"" so that fat bastard gets the blame. It's a black flag operation."
"I think it's a level above, it's actual war tactics alreadyl"
"Not really no, there are conventions against these kinds of weapons, nobody would use them."
r/technicallythetruth
I may have dreamt this but weren’t there a flashlight you could attach on the top so it would light up the screen? It was a long time ago i saw one of these
it doesn't even have color. get him a gba. it's like 35 usd
Cut your fingernails
Those batteries are replaceable you know.
"Jesus Christ, your fingernails"
Is that supposed to prove something? All you need for that shot is a cartridge with a newer battery.
What should that prove? That the batteries were replaced a year ago and that it is a week old save?
"Wait, interesting! So I could just find* CR2025 and order one and open up my Red cartridge and replace it? Or is it one of those, once it dies, that’s it? :(  
  
*Edit; “look up” is a huge faux pas, apparently. My apologies.  
Also WOW! Thank you for all the info and tips, etc. When I go home for the holidays I will definitely go through my old cartridges!"
Yeah I think $10 right? I re-played Yellow edition a few months ago on my 2DS.
Or the clip on light/magnifers
"As a matter of fact, a backlit Gameboy was just on the front page in the past day."
I had the backlight. Gameboy took 4 batteries and light took 4 batteries. A night of gaming in bed after lights out was ghastly expensive for a 7 year old!
"This may also sound immature but the display just isn’t stimulating enough, no colour or fluid movement, I couldn’t see myself being invested for any longer than a few minutes."
Pacman wasn't history in 1988 that was like current gen.
when I was 7 years old I don't think I had a concept of what games were retro or not
"I think Ashens showed off a backlit Game Boy (Color?) that was sold in Europe, but never released in the US. Though I could be mistaken because I know for sure he's shown DIY backlight versions as well, so I may be getting confused."
"Gen 1 is an original Gameboy game (the colour hadn't released when 1st gen released). The 2nd gen was a colour game, but could also be played on the original (except crystal, which was only colour)."
"Lovely story. How is that relevant? A lot of children think their grandparents used to live with dinosaurs. They don't have an understanding of time, and thats ok. It isn't necessary for a 7 year old to know what year the gameboy came out, or to even know the gameboy existed. I just find it ridiculous that so many people on this sub want to subject their child to old shit. 

I'm almost certianly younger than you, but I grew up with the PS2. I dont have kids, but I have a younger brother, he's 5 now. He doesn't play games by himself, but likes to play with me. Despite the fact i loved the PS2, and still have fond memories of a lot of the games, I dont force him to play that shit. We play lego games that came out in 2017, not 1998.

Yes, they sucked. Most old stuff does. The PS2 sucked, and the PS1 sucked even more. In 6-8 years, the PS3 will reach the suck stage. Modern consoles take a little longer to reach suck as we kind of plateaud on improvements."
Take it to a retro shop if this scares you
"I know you can swap out the batteries while the game is in a powered-on system and I assume that’s how most people do it

But will the Retron 5 back up a save as well if someone were to own one?"
This sounds like the subplot to a Seinfeld episode.
"Would it work if you plugged it into a GBA without the top part of the cart casing, then soldering it while the GBA powers the cartridge? I've replaced 10+ batteries as a side hobby and always was curious how to do it while preserving the files."
Wait how? I would love to preserve my game files!
"I've tried soldering posts to button batteries (I can solder normally, I'm not just having a go at it) but the batteries always seems to be too slippery and the solder simply rolls off. I've looked at the commercial batteries and the tabs seem to be attached with a small weld rather than solder?

Any advice for soldering them?"
"The memory is volatile so without power the data is gone.

There is a market, but it's probably very small as there is some labour involved and not many people will want to go messing with the cart"
"It’s usually instantaneous, but as with anything analogue there can be leeway, usually not long enough to be useful though 

Gen 2, or at least crystal, would measure what was left in the battery, though, and shut off power to the clock circuit if it got too low, prolonging the life of the save itself"
"There is a device for changing batteries without voltage. A GBA. The save is stored in the GBA memory so you can just save to the cart again once the swap is done. 

You can also back up the save and restore it using anything else, too."
It was shorter than the life for Red. I think they used shittier batteries or something.
"I’d be sad with a lost game too, but you can easily beat the game in under 2 weeks of serious gaming. 15 years is a long time man, maybe watch a walk through.



 ^s"
"I thought so but I wasn’t sure, that’s one of the few I never had."
"There’s a reason RPGs avoided password saves like the plague, even when batteries pushed cartridge production prices up by a considerable margin (a legimate concern considering RPGs rarely broke even on localization costs in the west)

Most games with password systems are linear, and can have a system where X code starts you at Y level with Z items, with stuff health resetting when you pick up again

The amount of those kinds of variables in RPGs is STAGGERING and especially in Pokémon with the highest variability in Party members in history"
My saves still work
he obviously did not blow in his as hard as we did
"Only bought N64 games that used save batteries? Most N64 games don't use SRAM + Battery. They use EEPROM or FlashRAM. But there are 12 games like Ocarina of Time that do use SRAM + Battery which can die. 

GBA is similar. Pokemon Ruby uses a battery for the clock but flash memory for the save. This is why you'll sometimes see a message saying the clock battery is dead but the game will still save on copies of the game."
Santa has had enough of your shit. Weaponize the little helpers!
"Piece of shit deserves it, he got credit for a whole ass swingset in 2011 fuck him I worked overtime"
There was indeed. Had one for mine as well as for the GB colour
and take off your shirt
"If the battery dies it only affects saving. You'll lose your file and won't be able to save a new one, but the rest of the game will be fine still. If you want to do a preventative swap before the battery dies you'll need to change it while the game is powered on otherwise you'll lose your file anyway."
Save games are affected. The game itself isn't. You should be able to find the battery and replace it fairly easily. You just need the specialized screw tip to open the cart.
"Yes you can

There are two ways you could; either get tabbed batteries (mostly available online) and a soldering iron to swap the battery out from the board (some used/retro game shops might let you pay them to do this for you, as they usually have to swap batteries themselves for their stock), or you can carefully cut the tabs off the battery already in the cartridge and tape a new, store bought one in. 
The latter makes it vulnerable to impacts, but it works otherwise"
A quick Google search tells me it's pretty easy to change said battery.
"look up??? it's available in any place that sells batteries. drugstore, grocery store, walmart, literally anything"
"They're free, the 3DS has virtually no anti-piracy measures!"
"I didn't mention the light boy because I assumed it was going to be really expensive like most old game accessories, but it's only like $30 for one on amazon."
"Oh wow, I must have missed that one, This dude I follow on youtube has a ton of videos of himself putting them together, I got really into it like a year ago or so, and hadn't heard anything about it since then. Glad to see more people finding out about them."
"I thought about modding my Color, but I already modded my gba to have a backlight and a glass screen so I didn't have much incentive."
"You can use the latest firmware on any hacked 3ds. The last thing Nintendo really did to combat piracy was taking down the freeshop and that was over a year ago. Every update since has been minor and the community always finds ways to use the latest firmware, it usually just breaks luma and you have to find the new update for it and replace its file. Its very hard to do anything wrong to your console with CFW. Its a very simple process for the amount of things you can do with CFW on the system. Especially having access to GBA games and save injection/back-up."
"Nintendo are real easy to hack tbh. I know PS are harder and can have you on older firmware, but even then there's a firmware spoof making it easy to just simulate a later firmware for whatever you'd need it for (like accessing store or playing games that are locked to certain firmwares which are really the only things that come to mind atm)."
You don't know anything about hacking them lmao.
"To be fair, born in 1988 not started playing then.

By time someone born in 1988 is 7 it's 1995, and pacman is 15 years old. The PS1 is out and they've just heard about the N64 in a magazine."
when this pokemon game was around I was younger and knew what systems like Atari and Sega were. I wanted to play em too
"I was just thinking about this lmao. I'm 25, my first game ever was the original Link's Awakening...and I told my husband, who had never played it, to play the remake instead. Why would I make him drudge through an old gameboy game that he is absolutely not going to experience my same nostalgia for? I enjoyed the original game and still do, maybe if he likes it enough to try the original I'll suggest the eshop version. We improve game technology and hardware for higher quality of life lmao....this is just like those boomer comics where they're sad that we don't read the Sears catalog or some shit, like, there's a reason younger people have newer game consoles? 

Tl;dr, you can't force your nostalgia on younger generations, if you do you're out of touch"
"It's not relevant at all, I just tried to give you a better insight to why I think it's nice for our kids to share what WE as their parents enjoyed in our life when we were at the same age as them. Never said I'd force my kid to play on a Playstation 1 instead of the newest console that will be available at that time. But having the option to choose playing on both is in my eyes way more interesting than getting stuck with only todays AAA games. I've got a steam library FULL of games I haven't even touched yet because I just don't get the excitement for them as I got with my old games and I'm not even talking only about the ones were talking here from 1995 but even just a few year older games."
The frogger one lol
"If you can reach the battery, yes."
"Buy a coin cell battery holder and 2 pieces of wire that you solder to the battery holder. Then on the cartridge, solder each wire to each of the battery tabs where they are soldered to the circuit board. Then put a new battery in the battery holder, desolder the old battery on the cartridge and solder in a new one. Then remove the wires from the tabs.

I hope this somewhat makes sense. You just have to make sure there always is at least one battery connected to the cartridge at both plus and minus side."
Should be videos on YouTube showing how.
"Were you using flux on the battery itself when trying to solder? Solder with flux in it is okay for some jobs but using more flux helps with wetting in scenarios like this, just make sure to clean the excess after. Scraping the surface with some ultra fine sand paper (400 or finer) can help as well.  The outside layer of most batteries is nickel coated steel, and nickel is known for forming a hard oxide layer which you must break through to solder to it, which the flux helps break up. I'd also recommend trying lead free silver solder if standard 60/40 isn't working well even with flux"
"Yeah, the terminals have been spot welded in place. For some types of battery this is crucial as soldering imparts too much heat over a prolonged period, which can cause them to catch fire.    

you can pick up a spot welder for batteries on eBay for $100 - $150, if you want one."
Flux and a really hot iron with lead solder. Dont heat it very long
"For the specific application of replacing the battery in Gameboy games, if you don't mind losing data, soldering is unnecessary. You can literally just use electrical tape to attach the original battery's tabs to the new battery. I've never tried to do it while preserving data, however, so I don't know how much that complicates things. It also looks a bit sloppy on Gameboy Color titles."
They are resistance welded.
I find that if you gently abrade the surface where the connection will be. Then clean with either acetone or alcohol then flux and tin the surface before attempting to attach a conducting element you'll have better luck. That's what works for me though your mileage may vary.
Yeah mine died very soon :(
"Yep. And luckily when third Gen came along, they didn't keep saves via the battery, but those carts did have a battery. It only controlled the game clock, so that battery you can change with no real bad side effects."
"You're right, but I also douse the gift in insect killer. It's what programmers do for Christmas to prevent bugs in their packages."
now rub your nipples
"You talk about 'while the game is powered on' but I was wondering.

If you put the cartridge in a gameboy that has power but is not turned on. Wil it still maintain memory even if the battery dies? It seems to work for my yellow cartridge (save gets deleted if to long out of gameboy, or inside gameboy without power) but not for my silver cartridge (can't save but also locks up after max 2 hours of playtime)"
"So I could theoretically  just ...never turn off my gameboy ever, and wouldn’t have to worry? :bigbrain:  
Kidding, that’s good to know though. I didn’t realize there was an “expiry date” to it."
"Awesome! Thanks for the simple explanation; handy work and the like is not my forte.  
I assume this would work the same for GBA games, too?"
"Okay, “find,” sorry, poor choice of words?"
Good to know. I haven't fiddled with it in a while and usually Nintendo is adamant on trying to patch the holes in the ship. My statement was made with the knowledge that homebrew for the 3DS used to need a specific version or was behind current.
"This sub is weird. Suggest piracy, get upvoted. Provide a link to an actual way to purchase a product within the means of the person you're talking to and... downvoted and mocked.

All this despite rule 3 on the sidebar."
"You literally don't know the basics of jailbreaking. For most of time on jailbreaking anything, you accept that your operating system will be behind on updates because hackers need to figure out how to exploit the latest leak that was fixed in the ship.

Also rule 3."
"Exactly, good example. When i got my (other) brother into pokemon, I definitely didn't start him on an oldie. It'd be like making your kid live without insulation in the house, or something."
"But the kid will never make that choice, so why bother? And its pretty difficult to make an AAA game today that is worse than the best AAA game from 20 years ago.

The new pokemon game has a lot of flaws, but is still infinitely better than Pokemon Red."
Good god man... I didn't even notice. Have to work on my awareness.
"I'm so confused, why are all your comments in this thread stolen from top comment?"
\*Lego bricks
HOLES! I NEED HOLES!
I've done the electrical tape thing with half a dozen or so NES and GB games. I never tried to retain the save; I'm changing the battery because it already died.
Only side effect I've seen personally is that after a friend changed a battery the time was wonky as hell. It would only change the time from between 12 to 1215 then cycle back to 12.
I learnt this recently.  Picked up my DS which had Pokemon Sapphire in the GBA port and loaded up my save but did mention clock was screwed.
"So it's possible to swap out the battery on my Emerald cartridge and get the internal clock running again? It's not much, but I would love to be able to get that full nostalgia blast again with that game."
"Nope, due to how the console is physically designed, the system is not running power through any circuits unless it is on"
"Hell the OG Gameboy even has a power adapter that would theoretically let you do just that

You would have to plug in the cartridge with it’s cover off if you planned to replace the battery eventually, though, or else you’ll be doomed the second the power blips off"
Except that the original Nintendo took aa batteries so you couldn’t just plug it in like you could with say a gba sp. so in a few hours that baby would die and you’d have to restart.
"Yes, though only Ruby Sapphire and Emerald need them, and only for the Clock
If you have any Pokémon games on GBA that aren’t saving at all, I’m afraid you’ve got an old bootleg, because they officially used Flash memory, and even most recently-made fakes have switched over just because it’s become cheaper

Also, RSE’s clock won’t start up again right away. Even though the Clock dumps its data when the battery dies, the save file retains data on how many ticks had passed the last time it was saved, which means the exact same amount of time has to pass again for the two clocks to resynchronize and time to start passing again. Depending on how long that was, it might be better to wipe the save and start over

That’s only for Pokémon games, though. There are a number of early gba cartridges like some Metroid fusion carts that used battery saves"
A similar comment was upvoted because they didn't come off as rude. Reddit is fickle.
"Rule 3. Lol

I found out how to hack my 3ds from this sub about a year ago from a long 3k upvoted comment chain. Rules literally dont matter on this sub."
"I did not suggest piracy. I and any reasonable person that is not a corporate shill believe that if you have ownership of the game you can run it in any form. All my roms are stripped off of my cartridges, if you think that's piracy you're a clown. Additionally I didn't mock him for the link nor anything to do with the topic of my previous comment, just his blatant ignorance on the subject for suggesting that you'd have to stay on an outdated firmware to use a hacked 3ds."
"Lol, you're still blatantly ignorant and wrong on the subject of *3ds* hacking."
"Games 20 years ago had a huuuuuuge variety and almost each game was different. There were rarely games that copied the mechanism of another and hence all of them or almost all of them were fun in their own way.

Games nowadays are mostly all the same. They follow the same pattern and mechanics and are only different in the art style or just small things that in the end turn out to be unimportant in the game.

There are of course a lot of very good games today but the other ones feel mostly all the same. Every battle royale game is the same expect for some minor details. Every horror game nowadays follows the same patterns. Every jump and run or action game also feels too similar when you play a few of them."
"I don’t know why, but I read “good god man” in the voice of the Indian boy on the Diary of a Wimpy kid movie lmao"
[deleted]
it's a bot. they build up karma with reposts and are then sold in bulk
That sounds like he put the battery in backwards.
"Yup, pop it open and it’s pretty clear on the board and I’m sure there’s tons of YouTube videos on how to do it. The gameboy/color carts used cr2032 batteries idk If that’s also true for advance."
"All GameBoys could be powered via an AC adapter, including the original."
"I don't think that guy saying ""and not have to keep your 3DS on an outdated firmware forever"" was *rude* per se. It seems like he might have been wrong, which is fair. I don't know anything about that. But he provided a link instead of just vaguely saying ""you can buy it on 3DS for cheap"".

I dunno, if I was OP I'd be more grateful to the guy providing a direct link than I would be to the guy being completely dismissive without even explaining anything. If rudeness was the only metric, then at the very least they *both* should be downvoted."
"Sure, but that's what I'm saying. Just shocking to me.

Completely different subreddit, but I got *blasted* by one dude the other day for just suggesting that I would probably watch most of the Disney+ Marvel series... erm... without paying for Disney+. Just an offhand comment, relevant to the discussion but six words out of my entire comment. Got a tirade about ""promoting piracy"".

Then, come here, and what most commonly amounts to piracy is being supported.

Just a stark difference that took me aback a bit."
"It doesn't really matter what you believe when it comes to the law. But more importantly, OP doesn't *seem* to be the most technologically inclined, or at the very least probably doesn't know any of the ins and outs of copying the rom from a cart you own.

I'd consider laughing at someone (""lmao"") to be mocking when you don't even do anything to try and tell them how they're wrong.

But, based on how you responded to the other guy, I'm just gonna go ahead and say you're kind of an ass."
Ok boomer
"If you don’t know what the meme means, don’t use it."
What is even the value of a reddit account
"It’s also a stupid statement. You can mod the 3DS and use near the latest firmware. Not only that, they’re no longer updating the 3DS."
"I'm an ass to fuckheads who act like they know what they're talking about when they really don't have a fucking clue and are just disagreeing to disagree. I never said I didn't mock him, I admitted to it just not for your reason because it was false."
"I want no part of this insult fest, but 3ds Homebrew tends to run on latest or one firmware behind. It doesn't really matter if the 3ds is updated because it runs on an emulated nand which can be downgraded to the earliest version or latest at your wish and doesn't impact your ""legit firmware"" The only thing I haven't kept up with is if there is any entry points for latest fws but there is a lot of unpatachable ones.

 You mostly only ever had to update fw on a modded 3ds the last ~3 yrs because one title or two would be incompatible. But they don't release full updates any longer so unless you encountered that it doesn't matter.

Either way, the 3ds has been blown wide open for several years now and hasnt had to have a magic firmware version for Homebrew for years. Latest or one step behind is always fine once you've got a exploit installed."
Lol research it yourself fucking moron. I'm not your teacher lmao.
"Oh wow. I thought we had a nice little discussion going on and now you hit me with that?

But I need to correct you, boomers would be my parent's. I'm the generation after that. Get your facts straight before calling someone a boomer."
"*To be fair*, near the latest is not the latest, so what you're saying is, he technically isn't wrong.

But, stupid though his statement may have been, I don't get why he deserves downvotes where the other guy is upvoted for suggesting what *most* people would resort to piracy to do."
"Well, that's fair. You didn't ever say you didn't mock him, I was wrong to phrase it that way. You are also possibly the most correct you have ever been in your entire life with those first three words. If you had ended there, it could have gone down in history as the most accurate statement ever dedicated to the written word!"
"Thanks for the informational response. Last I checked on homebrew, you needed specific updates that were well behind. Something must have changed in the homebrew scene. I wouldn't be surprised if someone found a game that acts as an exploit."
You sound like a wonderful person. I'm sure you have loads of friends just calling everyone an idiot when you won't even prove them wrong.
"Oh, my bad. Ok Xer.

Seriously though, I am sorry if you actually are a normal person, but I've spoken to far too many people with ridiculous wooden views, and their points always start the way yours did."
Comment
Listen people will use anything as an excuse to not eat lettuce
Because this affects the antivaxxers and not just their kids.
"“You could’ve saved us! But you lettuce die!”

^ 
Antivax-offspring, likely"
Because things that everyone knows don't make me feel special...
I actually knew an antivaxxer who posted on social media she wasn’t throwing out her potentially contaminated lettuce because she doesn’t do what the government tells her.
Dude don't say that antivaxxers will just start eating one-day-out-of-date lettuce
"This is truth I work grocery and we took care of everything right away. Ive had on average 6 people a day approach me in the produce department and ask me about this shit. The worst thing is they're not even buying produce, like they legitimately waddled over from selecting stuber on blu ray just to say this shit out loud and appear informed for 5 whole seconds."
A la carte belief system
Is romaine lettuce a shit magnet or something?  There’s been a few times in the past couple years that this has happened.
For the same reason creationists don’t mind using fossil fuels
"Because most people just care about themselves. Not other people. Think about it - all the antivaxxers are only antivaxxers because they view the health risk of a vaxine as greater than the benefit. Be damned herd immunity, cancer patients, elderly, and imuno-compromised children. Most people do most things for purely selfish reasons imo"
"If vaccines worked, why not make a lettuce vaccine, huh? Because they don't want their mind control/population control to fail. E. Coli party at the compound! *Please remember to bring the lavender essential oils, no mix ups like last time!"
They don't no about Big Lettuce yet.
"I get the point of this post, but just to be very clear, the FDA and USDA are the agencies responsible for evaluating food safety. To my knowledge, the CDC has never been involved in administering lettuce safety tips."
"Because the anti-vaxx movement is largely a dick-measuring contest by people who get off on feeling superior and like they are a better parent by denying the vaccines.

Can’t do that shit with lettuce. Lettuce get real with this."
"Big lettuce is just trying to sell you more lettuce. It's all a conspiracy  You throw it out when there's an ""e. coli contamination""  then you have to buy more so it can sit it the fridge while you tell yourself you'll definitely eat it eventually only to get takeout every night until you finally ""decide"" to eat it only to discover it's conveniently gone bad so you have to throw it out before buying more lettuce to not eat at the store where you cut your hand on a rusty shopping cart and die of tetanus you unvaccinated fucktard."
"I'm working on a project at the CDC. I've spent the last 3 weeks in the Polio labs. Today I was asked for my titer test, to see that my vaccine was producing antibodies. I showed them.

But we need type 2 and this only shows type 1 and 3. We're the only place that can test for type 2.

I feel this was information I should have been asked for 3 weeks ago."
"The best is when they use it as evidence to support their wildly incorrect beliefs that science and medicine are concrete and these wishy-washy changes solidifies it.




Scientific and mathematics are taught to eight year old children, I hate that it doesn't stick."
This is an extremely valid and crucial point.
This is a Part to Whole fallacy. “Well if some of it is than all of it is”. Take eating a candy bar for example. The chocolate is good. The nougat is good. The peanuts are good. But the wrapper? I’ll pass.
Because there’s no profit to be made by telling people to throw out lettuce.
"Can’t I just thoroughly wash my Romain like I do all
my other fruits and veggies?"
But they’re right and you’re wrong
One of those things is pokey.
THIS.
Everyone? Lol keep acting like these people are the majority if it makes you feel smarter somehow
"From the pictures I've seen, anti-vaxxers are not the type of people who buy romaine lettuce."
"I think it’s because people believe that vaccinations cause autism. The numbers of kids getting autism in America has been getting higher, especially once certain new combo-vaccines were brought to market. The movement wants the individual vaccines not the 3 in 1 shots.  If they can’t get the individual shots, they chose none."
People care about what they put into their bodies.  It applies to both sides of the debate.
"""My body my choice"""
Because not putting something in your body seems safer than putting something in your body.
Then again I’m not vaccinated.
When has Romaine lettuce ever been safe to eat?
Because about 33.3% of the population are dumb as hell about certain things.  Just look at most polls. They may be smart in one area but good Lord common sense is lacking for a lot of people. Hell were all guilty in some way.   Just like I'm sure I screwed up we are.
"Vaccines are like Epstein, even if they do cause harm to .01% of girls getting the HPV vaccine or autism in a minute amount of people, the alternative is so bad, that's it's worth tucking it under the rug. 

(Ala Epstein's testimony would have destabilized the political landscape of the entire world and caused far more damage than he ever did and if you downvote this you agree that he killed himself.)"
One requires someone to do something.  And the other requires someone to do nothing (as in not eat the lettuce.).
One costs corporations millions of dollars the other makes corporations billions of dollars.
Isn't there a scandal over the CDC not revealing ecoli contamination for weeks after it's discovered?
"I did a bit of work with ATSDR lists https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov and people would lose their shit if they had something coming off the list.  Those same people would argue their eyeballs out about vax's being useless or designed to kill babies or whatever else.  Shit, I even listened to this one jackass who clearly stated it was a Government mind control program.  Fucking idiots."
"Haha can you imagine. I'm anti food recall, I read that salmonella is good for the skin."
Because society is mentally challenged en masse.
I don’t think those people believe or trust the CDC either
"Because the vaccines are for their children not themselves.  If ebola ever broke out in the US and there was a vaccine for it, you can bet anti-vaxxers would be in line for it."
Throw out the lettuce vecause you dont have your vaccines.
"Other than being nutty, you can imagine people would have an easier time listening to the CDC telling you not to put something in your body than listening to the CDC telling you to put something in your body."
"When my restaurant refused to sell lettuce during the e coli outbreak I had to call the police 4 times in 2 months. People lost their god damn minds about it. Understand, we used lettuce on MAYBE 10% of our items. I had 5 employees quit during this time, and countless employees break down in tears. I myself had to physically restrain a man in his 40s from walking into my kitchen. We get alot of wild shit in my area, but people are fucking insane."
Lettuce doesn’t cause autism duh
"There’s a big difference between 
telling someone to not do something (eat lettuce) vs 
telling them to do something (get vaccinated). I am vaccinated btw."
Or we could be talking about different reactions by different people. With any luck anti-vaxxers will also blow off the romaine warning.
"No one wants to eat shit (literally), but they don't seem to mind if their kids do (figuratively)."
Same reason ppl think Bill Clinton was a good president and that he also is a rapist and a paedophile.  Theyre not mutually exclusive
"Yeah or how about when our scientists say the Earth is dying and then all the people in power are like ""yahhhh nah"". trump is a weak little bitch boy."
"I stopped eating Romain lettuce and now my niece is autistic.

You can't explain that."
"Disgust...no, that’s actually the reason why. Disgust of lettuce and the chemicals that they believe are harmful."
Not anti-vax but off the top of my head it's easier to justify throwing something away then to let yourself be injected with something.
Also just sayin- if youre from the bay area/sacramento region of California- really dont eat the lettuce right now. Just survived 2 days of hurling after eating a giant salad at a restaurant. Trust me dudes
"To play devil’s advocate, these are actually non comparable. Delete this post nephew."
"Um...so why does no one listen when there are adverse effects?  They do exist, ya know.  Just sayin’."
"So what you are saying is anti-vaxers should be grubbing on some lettuce? 

Help build the immune system!"
"I mean I think the answer is sorta obvious: it's easier to trust someone saying ""this is bad, don't put this in your body"" than it is to trust someone saying ""this is good, put this in your body.""

Still tho, get your fucking vaccinations ya dingus"
"The CDC also says that guns save exponentially more lives than they take, yet no one believes that either..."
Duck the cdc
"Honest answer, because bill gates didn't list ""romaine lettuce"" as one of the ways to control the population."
"Because the government is allowing fields to be fertilized with biosolids, sewer sludge, so there is no surprise when they say there is an ecoli outbreak from it. 

Here is another not surprising thing, those biosolids are filled with household cleaning chemicals too, and they are putting that shit on the fields where they grow our food- https://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/biosolids.html"
"It's because they're smart enough to understand that tainted food is bad. It doesn't take any significant level of intelligence to understand, everyone intuitively gets that contaminated or spoiled food makes you sick. Understanding vaccines on the other hand is beyond the level of comprehension of most anti-vaxxers, so the second they were given a reason to reject them, they took it, because we instinctively react to what we don't understand with fear."
"Romaine lettuce causes autism, spread the word


I've never eaten romaine lettuce and I don't have autism. There's your evidence"
"Probably because the pharmaceutical companies have a long and documented history selling products that were known to be harmful or even contaminated with HIV, going as far as having a revolving door between said companies with a paid position after working on getting it approved as a government job.

* what If you believe In the idea of a vaccine and gained immunity?, but just don’t trust the pharmaceutical companies? You know those same ones that In  every other thread are super crooked Denying people basic healthcare because the costs are astronomical"
"Because vaccines are scary because they are metal pointy sticks filled with dangerous sounding chemicals and viruses that are somehow supposed to stop you getting the same virus being injected. 

Lettuce is natural and great and comes from the earth and its peaceful, green and healthy and vibrant!

Until you are warned it has ecoli and suddenly it is also super scary because it is infected and must go

I’m not sayin it makes sense, but anti vaxers aren’t super intelligent and they make their decisions based off of emotions not the reality of things"
People can't properly proces data when it conflicts with their world view. That's why left and right can't communicate.
Because throwing out your romaine lettuce clearly has no negative impact on you. I disagree with anti-vaxxers obviously but this is a false equivalency.
"Anyone who thinks there is a magic ruling Illuminati, and doesn’t vaccinate their kids...


Well..."
It’s still alive and kicking. Just quarantined
What if antivaxx is nature's way of fighting back against modern medicine and overpopulation. Maybe this is the great filter everyone was talking about.
I don’t know why we keep trusting lettuce.. /s
"Same reason people deny climate change by saying that the earth naturally cools down and heats up, all information courtesy of climate scientists"
"When I order a salad and someone says there's e-coli in the lettuce, I shrug, ""I guess I'm going on a cleanse, then."""
"I mean, its pretty clearly not the same concept at all. The link between bacteria, contaminated food and immediate sickness is pretty well developed in most people's minds. People have no problem accepting that contaminated lettuce has a very good chance of making them sick. Eating it means you chancing your immediate health for 3 bucks of produce in most people's minds, whereas with vaccines the entire concept is much more abstract without immediate consequences. With vaccines there is no clear immediate consequences of not getting them and in some people's minds the cost includes a chance to give your child autism, which is much more pricey than 3 dollars of produce."

I threw out my lettuce!

"Yeah, there are immediate consequences for the person who made the decision."
"Well, the real reason is that plenty of people don't believe it and think it's a hoax, but we don't hear about it. Honestly, probably a decent number of anti-vaxxers don't believe in lettuce recalls either, and a decent number of normal people are just too lazy and just figure it's nothing.

However, when people don't vaccinate their kids on a large level, it causes death... of children. When people don't throw out their lettuce, it causes lots of diarrhea and *maybe* a death or two, but generally of adults who knew they were risking it with that romaine."
"It's kind of insane, like their own existence is basically proof of the vaccines working. Yet they disregard that fact and subject someone with the inability to choose for themselves, to a life with no vaccinations. It's utterly unreasonable to me."

"I just found my ticket stub for Stuber in a pair of jorts today and holy shit, that's $12 that could have been used a million better ways. Kumail did that movie fresh from an OSCAR NOMINATION."
"It grows on the ground, it's difficult to clean with all the crevices (without cutting it up), people who pick it shit on it (or animals), you don't cook it, you can't really peel off the layers (like a carrot or beet), and a lot of people just pop open those premixed salad packages and dump it into a bowl to serve.

Even other stuff that grows in the ground like carrots, or beets people will typically wash them first to at least get the visual dirt off, and then peel them. They are also smooth/round vs the folds and what not in lettuce so even if you are shit at washing veggies it's difficult to screw up when you peel them."
"Yes, it is.  A lot of fecal matter ends up in fields for a variety of reasons (poor water, flooding, nearby sewage, etc.). No big deal for most crops, but with a loose, leafy green growing right on the ground it can be a disaster."

Edit: to be clear, when in doubt, dont eat that shit."
I...don’t understand how this relates to the lettuce post.
"Thanks /u/thats_right_asshole , very cool!"
"Not really, I'm not anti vax, but if someone is it makes logical sense that throwing out perfectly good lettuce would be an easier risk to take than giving your children brain damage."
"Many reasons. Lettuce is grown directly into the ground and can catch many things on it due to it have many crevices it can have. 

Due to that it’s hard to clean it without cutting up the lettuce. It’s not gonna get cooked often either so there’s that."
"On the contrary, they'll have to buy more food. Nothing is more profitable than making people get rid of something when they need to replace."
"So [a quick search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Can’t+I+just+thoroughly+wash+my+Romain+like+I+do+all+my+other+fruits+and+veggies%3F) found [an article](https://www.consumerreports.org/e-coli/washing-greens-protect-e-coli/) which says:

>According to James Rogers, Ph.D., director of Food Safety and Research at Consumer Reports, if E. coli (or any other type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning) is present in your produce, washing it won’t remove all of those organisms. And it doesn’t take much bacteria to make you sick.

>“It is very difficult to remove bacteria from leafy greens,” he says. “Bacteria have the ability to adhere to the surface of the leaves, and to get stuck in microscopic crevices.” E. coli bacteria can even find their way into the interior of your produce.

>Washing lettuce in water (or water combined with baking soda) may help remove pesticide residue, surface dirt and debris from produce, but Rogers cautions that washing has not been proven an effective way to remove E. coli and related bacteria."
Damn right thats the devil's lettuce

It's almost as if we've developed some means of  inoculating most of our population against polio and measles so they're less of a problem.
Well that is your opinion. Even if it is true.
"That's like saying more people die in car accidents now than before seatbelt regulations. Both are true facts, but the implication is false: there are more car deaths because there are more cars, not because they are less safe. Similarly, there are more foodborne illness deaths because vaccines have lowered the number of cases of measles and polio, not because the foodborne illnesses are more dangerous."
Neither do vaccines but I’m assuming you’re not gonna listen to the thousands of studies showing that
"That’s right.  We should only trust corporations (such as, say, Comcast or EA)."
"Wasn't there a measles outbreak in the last couple years?

Seems worth bashing."
"Even a FEW people being shitheads and not vaccinating can cause problems, it causes even MORE problems when they dont vaccinate their children and they die or spread disease to other children who CANT be vaccinated due to health issues."
Not really. No one was trying to convince people to eat their E. coli lettuce or start a pro romaine movement when that happened
"It's a nice double negative, but it's not sarcastic enough."
r/foundtheantivaxx
I agree but we as a species don't tend to like healthy food
"It's the worst leafy green though. Few macronutrients, tastes like nothing, and has a weird texture.

Spinach is better all around. Kale is better sauteed. Arugula is better for you."
Know whats better than Lettuce? Not Lettuce
"With leafy greens, sometimes eating them by themselves raw (or not?) gets better the more you eat. At first it’s just okay but after 10-20 leafs you appreciate that juicy and perfectly balanced fiberous plant texture. Delicious."
BURN THE WITCH
As long as it isn't iceberg. Iceberg is just water that taste like grass. Baby spinach is still superior to all types of lettuce or salad makings. Arugula is second. Kale can go fuck off unless its blended into a smoothie or something so I cant taste its funky ass.
"Reconsider your life, your choices, and the calibration of your tastebuds. You absolute fool, you genuine rube, you."
"Lettuce is nutritionally bankrupt. Only value it has is that you can fill up on it to feel full and it’s low calorie. Better off eating kale,spinach, etc."
But like why does romaine have to get recalled? That's my favorite :(
"Only crunchy water lettuce though, nothing else is acceptable"
"Dude, Are u a rabbit"
Gotta wash it off first
Found the lettuce sympathizer.
"Lettuce barely qualifies as filter, imo. I much prefer spinach."
lettuce tastes like nothing.
"""mmmm, crunchy water"""
Ever added some lemon drops and tajin? Best snack ever
"Great in salad, great in sammiches.

Can be used to replace flour tortillas for some dishes.

Depending on how its cut it eats very differently as well.

I love me some lettuce."
Lettuce soup is a revelation!
"Leaf of lettuce, slice of ham, some garlic and herb cream cheese. It's quite tasty."

Ah fair because it had to do with an E. Coli outbreak.
"It was just announced that polio vaccine causes more polio than the wild virus. Although, that's because a lot of countries still use the live vaccine"
It's at the CDC. Says it right there.
Think harder
"Thank you! I can honestly say though last year I ordered a Caesar salad during a recall in California, and they substituted ice berg lettuce, if given the option I’ll take my chances surviving E. Coli

Edit: if you saw how much cookie dough, and rare steaks I eat E. Coli would be the cdc’s last concern."
[deleted]
"You don't trust the FDA? Just replace it with CDC, it makes the same point."
"Yes, and?  That's the reality we live in.  Foodborne illnesses kill far more people than measles and polio."
"No, that isn't my opinion.  It is called a fact."
"
>Similarly, there are more foodborne illness deaths because vaccines have lowered the number of cases of measles and polio, not because the foodborne illnesses are more dangerous.

Of course foodborne illnesses are more dangerous.  Many people die from them every year.  Deaths from polio and measles are essentially zero in the US.  Why do you people pretend we live in some alternate reality where no one is vaccinated?  BuT iF vAcCiNeS dIdNt ExIsT!  In the actual real world the odds of dying from the measles or polio in the US is essentially zero, regardless of if you are vaccinated or not.  

Your car analogy is just stupid because tens of thousands of people are still killed by cars every year."
I disagree. We shouldn't trust them either!
I’m pretty sure there was one this year too
Honestly I love reddit. I would never allow myself or my family to die for not get vaccines.
"We do, it’s just now through human ingenuity...we have access to large amounts of food......and with it large amounts of things we’d have to get naturally like sugar etc lol"
Makes sense
"Little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic and baby you got a salad goin."
"No, healthy food is easy to profit off of and charge outrages prices. Unhealthy food is also heavily subsidized allowing for insanely cheap prices."
That's why we invented Ranch.
Lettuce has like almost no nutritional value besides the fact that it's like 90% water
"[I don’t think that’s it. Healthy food is simply not as accessible in the US. ](https://youtu.be/lr4MmmWQtZM) 

In my own life, if there was a healthy alternative for morning drive-thru’s, I’d choose that in a heartbeat. The closest drive thru to me and most ppl is a mcdonald’s."
"when i eat salad i eat mixed greens (like spinach/chard/baby kale) but if i wasn't thinking about nutrition and just wanted a tasty salad i'd choose iceberg. i like the crispy texture and it's the least bitter. it just seems like a waste of time though since it's mostly water.

i like spinach but the texture is the only part i don't like. it leaves a weird gritty/chalky film on my teeth. and you have to pick out all the wilting slimy ones any time you make a salad."
Lettuce from the store just tastes like disappointment. Lettuce right out of the garden is sublime.
"i agree with you completely but i could still eat a head of lettuce and be super stoked

cabbage though, that's where the real money is"
"we grew arugula, the flowers were so delightful, a delicious zip, i fell in love with them, i miss my garden

there are so many greens better for you than lettuce, tulsi,spinach, collards, mustard, kale"
Spinach is where it's at.
"Just came here to say that in Italy, they call arugula “rocket”, and it makes me happy."
"Dandelion greens, beet greens, arugula. Those are the tastiest greens imo"
Poop is not lettuce. Is it better?
"Nothing's better than just absolutely slaying an entire pound of food and only getting 12 calories, 3 glasses of water, and 3 days worth of fiber out of the deal"
It's great if you get enough watery fiber in your diet then you become the HUMAN ROCKET.
"Kale and spinach might have more nutrients, but lettuce is far from being ""nutritionally bankrupt"". It contains a plethora of vitamins, being especially rich in Vitamin K and A, with a generous amount of folate and molybdenum."
wouldn't that make it really good for someone on a calorie based weight loss diet?
Yeah soggy lettuce is gross
The crunch
Crunchy water
"Ayy, large cranium gang assemble"
Eat my shit instead
It is
"With an account name like that, my money is on ""yes""."
Or a really good one
Who tf gilded this
"I know. But, I’m sorry, I just missed the connection between the lettuce story and yours. Also - you work in a fascinating place!"
I didn't say it was a good conspiracy.
"... I don't remember vaccines being part of the conservative agenda...

Oh duh I forgot they don't give a damn about people with pre-existing conditions, I guess vaccine hatred is the next line item for them then. 

Also one can be Christian and fall on the left side of the political spectrum, all they have to do is be able to read and not cite nonsense to justify inherently evil deeds."
literally what does that have to do with not getting vaccines? the reason it doesnt kill as many people is because people get vaccines
[deleted]
"It's only close to zero due to herd immunity. And my car analogy had nothing to do with numbers; the analogy was stating that something isn't more dangerous simply because the number of people affected is higher. There would be more car deaths without seatbelts, and more people would die of measles and polio without the vaccine.

I can't even tell if you are a troll or not, and at this point, your logic is so flawed that you can't have intelligent conversation."
"Refined sugar is really the big bad here, methinks."
Grains and simple carbs in general. We now know the old food pyramid was upside down. Just a convenience of agriculture.
And cheese
"Does it? Everything is bad for you, drink too much water, you die because your salt content is fucked up. We should just eat beans from a can + avocados and nuts :) drink ur nut its delicious + bacon and eggs lel"
"Humans have always craved ""unhealthy shit"", it was just much more rare. Now, its way too abundant. You could say we've been conditioned to want certain brands of unhealthy shit."
Nothing beats that fresh crunch of biting into an iceberg
The slime is how you know it's gettin' good!
"Hey man a wedge salad sounds pedestrian, but fuck if that shit ain’t fucking delicious"
"Store bought vegetables(not from a farmers market) will always taste sub par when compared to fresh from the garden. Store bought is usually a week or two old, not ripe, too ripe, or has a weak flavor"
Agreed.
"I'm a sprout man myself. Had the first batch of the season on Sunday,  lush in a roast."
"Depends where you put it.

* In your toilet - good
* On your fields to fertilize your non-lettuce veggies - excellent
* In your mouth - not good ^^^^^^but  ^^^^^^depends ^^^^^^what ^^^^^^you're ^^^^^^into"
Yeah but then you gotta eat something with some substance 30 minutes later.
It's more like you never have to buy toilet paper again as long as you can pee standing up
[deleted]
Pencils also have crunch
"I don't really like crunch for the sake of crunch, I prefer it to have some actual flavor to it"
You know what's up
i'd rather eat iceberg
ya never know these days!
It’s too on the nose to be good.
"Me.

Just kidding. But could you imagine?"
"Not really, when it comes down to it it's just an office that has some rooms where I have to wear special gloves and a white coat, and sign a piece of paper when I enter and leave. Most of my job there boils down to walking into a lab, asking where the expensive equipment has gotten to and then telling them to stop moving it followed by begging them to stop moving it. Then I have to write a report on why the readings are incorrect.

"Again, that is completely irrelevant to the point, you absolute dehydrated almond.  Let's slow it down for you:  why do people care more about foodborne illness warnings?  Because many people die from them every year in the US.  Why do people seemingly care less about vaccine recommendations?  Because most people are vaccinated and no one in the US is dying from polio and the measles. Use your tiny brain."
"I can't lay it out any simpler.  I stated undeniable facts and you are arguing with them.  You are living in an alternative reality where vaccines don't exist.  More people would die if vaccines didn't exist!!! LOL.  No shit.  Foodborne illnesses kill far, far, far more people in the US than polio or measles.  Fact.  That is why people are more concerned about them."
The sugar industry buried science that shows it's as bad as smoking. But here have some more high fructose corn syrup.
"Fed Up is a great Netflix documentary about sugar, the industry, legislation, etc."
high fructose corn syrup is the real enemy. Sugar has a place in food. That shit does not.
Leave cheese out of this.
Cheese is the bomb you shut your mouth
It's extremes that tend to be bad. Different substances however have different extremes.
"We didn’t used to have piles of manufactured fake food available without effort, whereas real food has effort involved"
Lots of things beat that tho..
And often stored at near freezing temps to preserve it which also destroys flavor
"The problem is that to get it to the stores they have to pick it before it is ripe because it will ripen during the shipping process.  The other thing is outside of growing season they are generally not near as good.   People seem to forget that food goes does not go from the farm to the store in a day or two.   

That is why often canned will often taste better than fresh from a big box store because the canned goods are generally picked right when ripe and then canned right away.    That said it varies between the different foods, sometimes the canning or freezing process will turn the food disgusting."
"unless its cat poop, then apparently you make coffee out of it"
The struggles of a plant based diet. I eat constantly
That's when you walk a few blocks down and pick up some Chinese food to go.
"2 cups of romaine lettuce provides:

107% daily value of vitamin K

45% daily value vitamin A

32% daily value folate

13% daily value molybdenum

7% daily value fiber

7% daily value manganese 

6% daily value biotin

6% daily value copper

6% daily value B1

5% daily value iron

...and so on and so on. That's pretty good, albeit not as nutrient dense as a sweet potato or something, but quite healthy."
Or too good to be on the nose
What are you trying to tell us in relations to OP?
Nice goalposting
It somewhat does though. It kind of hooks you onto a food.
Do you have a source for this? I’d like to read about it
"Well, I'd like to watch it, but it's not available to me."
High frutose corn syrup blocks the chemical in your brain that tells you that you're full.  Fun fact; Alcoholics put it in their drinks so they can keep drinking.
"They are the same thing.

HFCS is **5%** more fructose than regular sugar, which is 50% fructose

Your body does not treat them differently"
"I mean sugar isn't really needed by the body at all, so not exactly."
"Clearly you all have mistaken my intentions. I love cheese as much as the next fatty. Just sayin, we eat a lot of it (most more than we should).

It is not the worst thing for us. Crack is much worse."
"Lemon oil and garlic salad is my favorite thing, you’re invited to the potluck."
i basically said that in my comment
You gotta pump up your rice and lentil numbers.
"Also plantbased (well, vegan) here—its a good thing I love eating. And a lot of ‘plantbased junk food’ is filling. As well as certain staple foods and heartier meals."
I see what you did there you llort.

wow that is a fun fact. I knew it was the devil.
">High frutose corn syrup blocks the chemical in your brain that tells you that you're full.  

So does sugar.

Sugar is 50/50 fructose and glucose.  HFCS is 55 fructose and 45 glucose.

It's a negligible difference as far as your body is concerned"
Well damn. I have a drinking problem I struggled with for a long time before smothering that bitch down and I guess I'm glad I never knew this trick
"Really? I’m an alcoholic and never heard of this. Where do they sell High Fructose Corn Syrup, anyway?"
5% is 5%
Everyone that cooks would tend to disagree
I'm there. I'll bring the parmesan.
Lentils were invented by satin to punish humans for loving denim too much.

Its etiquette to relate your comment with the topic at hand. Makes less confusion and more enjoyable comments.
So you’re just telling a story for no reason?
That makes two of us
Speak for yourself. *eats broccoli...covered in cheese!!!*
unless they’re slathered in butter/cheese/stuff we add to food that’s not good for you but it masks the taste of not knowing how to cook things to remain healthy and tasting good
Idk man when I'm stoned I'll regularly rip through the like over a pound of carrots
"The real fun fact is that it's the same thing ""real sugar"" does to your brain and that high fructose corn syrup fear mongering specifically is bunk science. High Fructose Corn Syrup is bad for you in the exact same way as table sugar, no more no less."
"I didn't know that. Only reason I knew this was because a vet made me feed it to a kitten to raise her suger and get her to eat. He told me the fact about alcoholics and i looked it up, seems like a lot do.  I guess its almost the same as drinking liquor with pop."
In the baking section.  Most common brand i know is Karo. I only know this because a vet made me feed it to a kitten i found to raise its sugar and get it to eat.
"It's meaningless.

The corn and sugar industry came up with HFCS when sugar was getting a bad reputation.

Now they've laid the blame on HFCS so they can go back to ""real sugar"", as if that's better.

You are still falling for marketing, plain and simple.

Next, I'm sure they'll try to market some other replacement for cane sugar like agave and tell everyone it's ""better""."
I was thinking from a health perspective only - you're 100% right that sugar has a wealth of potential in adding flavour to food if that's the angle you're taking!
you ever sucked dick for cheese?
Can't tell if typo or not...

Teton is slang for boobs in Quebec
Looks so tranquil.
It’s a live Bob Ross!
Lovely
Amazing
My new lock screen. I am grateful. Thank you.
Great photos and a great user name! Haha!
Schwabacher Landing for anyone who wants to visit.
The Tetons. Grand Teton is one of them. The Grand Tetons do not exist.
That would make a very cosy phone wallpaper
Thank you for the new lock screen
Beautiful!
Nor have I! Moved up there recently and have been loving every moment
When I see this type of pics I can only wonder what tetrachromatics see
"This is beautiful, it looks like a painting"
Saved for my phone background!!!
I think my soul visits here when I’m sleeping
 Beautiful. I have great memories as a kid hiking all around there one summer.
Wow
Its too beautiful to be real.
I'm pretty sure this is a painting by Bob Ross.
I thought this was my [desktop background](https://imgur.com/7fCt86t) for a second
"This gives me such a warm and comfy vibe that just makes me smile. Thank you, I needed this."
I wanna go so bad. I was gonna climb the grand this summer but I changed my mind last minute and went to Utah
"look like a painting,color are amazing, we can see this place as paradise."
I cant help but to think of Bob Ross
Could be an Apple wallpaper!
"amazing picture with a colorful view,i love this place,"
Looks like a Bob Ross painting.
"I would honestly print this out, frame it, and hang it on my bedroom wall. Amazing shot!"
whoa
"I want to live here but it is so, so expensive."
"I hate rainy mornings,
They are the goddamn best"
Beautiful shot
"I live here, and yes, its really that beautiful 90% of the time"
I swear to god all my wallpapers come from here
Looks like a Bob Ross painting
When did you take this? I’m heading that direction for thanksgiving and was thinking about visiting the park. I assumed it would be a lot snowier right now...
This is a stunning photo!
I’ve been blessed to see the Tetons in person on a number of occasions. My heart longs to see them again.
~~Grand Tetons~~ Teton Range
Looks like an inter-dimensional rift is about to open up
Hehe grand tetons
Grand Tétons means big nipples in French
Big bi energy Tetons
Holy shit. Is this edited
"Who took this photo? 
Looks like the work of Cody Meyer 18.  

Oh it’s Cody Meyer 22?!   
Good thing he told us... again."
VaporWave Ye
beautiful view
not gonna lie i’m probably gonna make this my wallpaper
Wow did you get a TRAINLOAD of upvotes! Congrats!
Reminded me of a Bob Ross painting immediately.
What peak is this a picture of? Like what section of the grand tetons is this? It's beautiful.
Woah
"We are getting plenty of pink sunsets in New Zealand at the moment, all that Australian bushfire smoke blowing over the Tassy"

Looks wet and warm
So extremely beautiful! I'm impressed by the stillness of the water!
Grand téton MDR (très belle photo)
great framing and great shot! where was this taken?
"Wyoming side, I presume?"
I contemplated.
I think that was kinda the point.
Grand means big: BIG TITTIES
"Quebec Survival Kit:

Gross Tetons, Petite Tetons, Poulet, Poutine, Biere, Tabernac."
It also means Nipple in French.
from Louisiana and it's pleasing to know our Cajun French dialect has lived. Tetons for life.
"Hence the term ""bodacious tetons""."
Every thread
Great fishin in Quebec!
It’s not really slang since it means nipple in french
My dad always called 'em the Grand Tits.
"Well in France it's not really slang, just the word for nipple haha"
"Read the book “Astoria,” has the origin story of this range...and every range."
Yes I find them quite Grand sometimes
Yes. A neighboring peak at Grand Targhee is called Mary’s Nipple.
Came here to say this!
getting some vaporwave vibes from the pinks and blues
The colors are oddly satisfying
It was!
"I'm taking a break from marking exams with Joy of Painting episodes in the background, and it really is very similar to one of his compositions.

All that's missing is some brush and a happy little tree in the foreground."
I’ve just started painting along with Joy of Painting and my first thought seeing this was I should try to paint it! Bob even mentions the Grand Tetons in an episode I just watched.
Honestly though
I feel like every shot of the Tetons I see is composed on that spot of the Snake River.
Watched the 2017 eclipse from there and it was possibly the most profound experience of my life.
"For some reason, people simply don't like this being pointed out in any of the numerous daily posts where the name is incorrect.

The park:  Grand Teton National Park

The range:  the Tetons

The big pointy peak in the middle of the range (and this photo): the Grand Teton"
Do you know what this peak is?
I'm not this good at photoshop lol
I love bob ross he's definitely inspiration!
message me on ig if you want a print!
There it is.
"How did you become a billionaire? Joking aside, beautiful place to visit"
Hahaha. Good one.

Yep!
thanks!
heh *BOOBS*

Long live the Tetons!
Me too!
It wouldn't be a front page reddit pic without some kind of ostentatious bullshit overlaid to make it stick out
"It honestly just looks like Velvia.  I've seen similar stuff from Alex Burke so this doesn't strike me as overedited at all. 

Also, there's no need to cry Photoshop at every landscape image—editing is there for a reason and has been since the dawn of photography.  Just because you don't edit your phone snapshits doesn't make you a better photographer."
Just because there is editing doesn’t mean that people can’t enjoy it.
Neat
How edited is the picture? Can we see the original without edits anywhere?
Cries in eclipse
And the sound a chicken makes: ton Teton Teton Teton

"I’m so used to pictures from the Idaho side where my family has some land. Same beautiful mountain range as this, but mirrored. I’ve never caught a great picture like this though!"
"Seriously, though... you don't need crank your saturation up to 11 for sunset photos. Try to work on your composition so your photo doesn't end up a rainbow mess. Stay away from a single dominant color (say, like pink) because large swaths of it make your photo look flat. Check out what the grayscale looks like: are there any areas you can burn or dodge to add dimension and enhance composition? 

This photo is... colorful. There isn't much else to say about it. It's more decorative than atmospheric. It's cute but it's not good. Keep working, keep learning, and you'll get better."

Time to rename the sub r/editingporn or r/hypersaturatedporn since nothing here is even remotely close to what you could/would see with the naked eye
I too enjoyed Lisa Frank posters in the 90s.
"Well sure, there’s plenty of tasteful editing in the world... this just isn’t it"
"That doesn't mean anything, there is no such such thing as an original, if you're asking about the RAW picture."
I’m fond of the west side. Way more mountainous as you approach. Did Table a few years ago for the eclipse.
Agree to disagree then. Apparently many people think this looks nice. It may just not be to your specific taste.
"It means a lot for a photo as oversaturated as this one is.

When you skew the colors so much that it looks like an acid trip, people are justified to ask for an unprocessed version."
"This is a picture from this summer from me from the family land. [Harry Truman, Doris Day](https://imgur.com/gallery/b5tZVj8)"
"I’m not saying people won’t like it, I’m saying it’s not done well...."
"Again, there is no such thing as an unprocessed version. 
A RAW file is just data, and even to show a RAW file preview, the system needs to process the data to show a picture. That picture is flat and doesn't represent reality at all, as the colors are washed, there is no saturation at all, no contrast, etc (which is not the case with a JPEG straight out of the camera) and it basically depends on what settings you chose with your camera."

Comment
Love the consistency too. Hope we see it again in the Kenobi series.
"His was the third form primarily: Soresu, the way of the Mynock. Mainly defense, it was made for long-term fighting and survival, not for offensive moves like Djem-so. Obi-wan was THE master (as said by Master Windu) of the form throughout the clone wars. 

The start of the stance allows him to focus on the enemy and gives him a point to channel defenses.

edit: fixed for repetition and Windu’s words."
"The last one, from two Suns is my favorite. He switched to Qui Gon's stance knowing that Maul would probably try to use the same move that worked before. But Kenobi had been reflecting on that moment and learned from it and was ready and the fight was over very quickly. They explain it better on the behind the episode."
That scene in Rebels was one of the greatest moments in the series.
"is there any practical use for the 2 finger thing? it looks badass, just wondering if there's another reason"
"I always had this stance as a kid. Every time there was a lightsaber fight with my friends/brothers, I always picked the blue one and had that exact stance. 

Obi-Wan was my hero. Him and Spider-Man had massive influence on me as a person.

Thanks for finding this man."
His lightsaber is getting thinner
I don’t like how thin the blade is on the Rebels series. Keeps throwing me off lol
Never seen this but very cool.
"If there's two characters whose models look *amazing* in Rebels, it's the Emperor and Obi-Wan."
"He looks godlike in CW, he looks great in the movies, but he just looks funny in rebels"
His fighting stance against Vader in A New Hope is also pretty deadly.
"Well back in my day, we just called it Soresu, and we liked it that way!"
"Off topic, but the thinness of Rebels lightsabers really grinds my gears."
[This scene is one of the real highlights in Star Wars: Rebels.](https://youtu.be/shHkJVHFFAk) i love that you can clearly see the point Kenobi changes his fighting stance to the one be uses in Ep.4. Really cool attention to detail and a surprisingly satisfying end to ObiWan and Maul's rivalry.
Why does Obi Wan look like a pissed-off Jeremy Corbyn?
It's a move the jedi won't teach you. You poke them in the eyes with your 2 fingers. When they fall you tell them you have the high ground. Truly a unbeatable move.
"They look at the lightsaber, that's when you poke them in the eyes. - Obi Wan developing his style as a youngling"
He bouta poke them in the eyes the most powerful move and its the only place Grevious is vulnerable.
Reminds me of a defensive stance from Hema I briefly went to. Which makes sense in regards to the lightsaber technic he was a master in
God those toothpicks always irked me
Bro whats that shit of a lightsaber in rebels?
Light rapiers in Rebels always triggered me. Mimicking Ralph's art style isn't worth of breaking the consistency. Lightsabers dont look like that and its not how Kenobi's lightsaber looks like.
He did it one time in episode 3 and then they tried to make it his signature stance. Laaaaaaame.
I used to do it to my sister whenever I was mad haha idk why I stopped...
Wish the was a one from phantom but still love it
Army or not. You must realize you are doomed
always ready to poke someone in the eye
"Yes, whenever I take a photo with a lightsaber, I always try to copy his stance."
They call it the pointy stabby
"Obi-Wan's sword stance is taken from real life Tai Chi sword stance, the purpose of the leading fingers is to focus and to help with the flow of 'chi'"
"Form 3, if you'd like to know."
His lightsaber gets steadily dimmer
Cheese
Didn't he chance his stance in that scene in rebels to be that of qui gon's stance
I’d slice off the top of my head for sure doing that.
The ultimate no u
Hello there
And none of my action figures of him can do this pose...
"The Revenge of the sith novel describes the fights in quite a bit of details. Dooku observes that Kenobi is a master at Soresu.

When Obi Wan asks Windu why he's the one selected to kill Greivous, Windu tells him he is THE master of Soresu, and the style is best suited to fight against someone like Greivous."
"He learned the secrets of this stance from one of the three masters of the Triad of Stooj - Cur-Li. He trained with the other two masters, Mo'e and Lair-Re, but not to the same degree as master Cur-Li. The two outstretched fingers are a dead giveaway and has only one known defense - an open palm helm perpendicular between the eyes. Very few have ever bothered to learn this technique, however."
I love the consistency of his lightsaber hilt!
Hello there
"Yes, very...admirable?"
"What is older Obi Wan wielding, a kitchen knife for a lightsaber?"
Clone Wars Kenobi has the best armor
It's a classic three pronged attack!
"We didn't see Sir Alec doing it in ANH, did we? It was invented by the prequels?"
One missing from pic...
Lightsaber in Rebels looks like an unfinished still from ANH where you could only see the sticks with the reflective material.
"According to a professional his stance isn't very useful, in fact it's harmful."
Vegeta
"Look at that flimsy ass rebels light saber, clone wars is supreme"
"as a fan who was raised on the movies, this ""peace sign"" lightsaber stance always seemed cringey and dumb to me. What kind of benefit does he gain over his adversaries by making the peace sign? But, okay, it's science fiction/adventure... so maybe it's just supposed to be a little piece of ""stylized action violence"" for the movies. That's great and all, but he only does this stance *once* and only for a very brief moment of time. It's not like it's ""iconic"" Obi Wan or anything. Idk it just always seemed kinda random, cringey, and pointless to me."
The Rebels lightsabers bug me for some reason
"I always thought it was really dorky with the fingers. Like he's saying, no closer or I'll poke your eyes out."
It’s not a stance it’s a shitty Hollywood effect that circlejerkers have retroactively interpreted as cinematic genius.
"I like the armored clone wars version the most. It gives it more of a badass feel. But that toothpick... man, do I hate that."
"Nobody: 
Rebels Lightsaber: Mama Mia! It'sa Spaghetti Time!"
"Why does his lightsaber get thinner?

Is the battery running out?"
Why did they make lightsabers thinner in rebels. Makes no sense
you forgot to add an imagine of Alec Guiness using this stance
"Form III also known as Soresu, or Resilience Form :) one of the most prestigious practitioners of the form"
"So his lightsaber, the thing that kills the other guy but also stops himself getting killed, isn’t actually between him and his opponent! In order to use his saber to block his body he now has to move into a new position, which takes time. Time is the difference between being dead and being alive. Cool as this looks, the first rule of fighting with swords is distance from your opponent.  This stance limits how much of his saber is useful and increases how much of his body is in danger.  You stood like that against me I’d chop your hand off. Seriously if your opponent has their sword in their right hand there is literally nothing between your left hand and their sword."
"I literally just watched this episode about the same time this was posted. Its my first run through rebels, and I have to say that the quickness of the end to Maul was very disappointing."
One saber is not like the other..
"Didnt windup refer to him as THE master of the third form IIRC?

Edit:Windu but windup works too"
"> His was the third form primarily: Soresu, the way of the Mynock. Mainly used for defense 

Does the choreography of the prequels or the cartoons show this? I didn't pay special attention in my previous viewings."
"Hasn’t it been specified that he wasn’t just a master but rather the master of Soresu, with few throughout history ever rivaling his skill in it?"
Have these forms been recanonized yet? I’m not sure if they’ve been addressed since the canon wipe. I hope so though.
"IIRC Also in the episode 3 novelization, Dooku notes that Obi Wan had become a true master of the form"
It's also a nice way to get an accidental haircut.
Why is it the way of the mynock? I thought those were like parasitic space power bats
Did you know: The fingers are also used to poke his enemies eyes so he can run away(Survival)
My man watches Star Wars Theory.
"I don't know all those fancy words - all I see is a one-handed variation on the ox guard.

[https://i.imgur.com/YZrNKue.png](https://i.imgur.com/YZrNKue.png)"
Didn’t he use defence a lot because his not highly force sensitive
So many people think that somehow makes it *less* awesome.
"Always bugs me when people say they don't like it because ""The fight was too short!"". Smh, there's so much more going on; it's deeper than that. Y'all just don't get it."
It’s my personal favorite moment in the entire franchise. Symbolizes a whole lot and hit me really hard the first time it aired.
"Get poked in the eyes and you will know.

Force poke is no laughing matter."
some chinese sword techniques use it and from what I recall it does help with judging the distance between yourself and your opponent.
"I think the idea is your eyes instinctively follow your fingers to your opponent so you can focus on them without any distractions. 

Of course I'm not going to pretend that I've studied the blade like half the internet so I don't know how practical it actually is."
According to a couple of self-appointed youtube sword experts the stance is pretty well much useless. Personally I wouldn't have a clue how much truth there is in that statement.
Obi Wan and Peter Parker were my childhood heroes and I still love them as an adult!
Fuck bro same. I got obi wan’s lightsaber for my sixth or seventh birthday and I always did this. McGregor as obi wan really was my hero.
"So how’s being a force slinging, web using super Jedi going?"
You and I had very similar childhoods.
"Both voiced by the same person too, for the most part. James Arnold Taylor"
">Him and Spider-Man had massive influence on me as a person.

If those two characters influenced you, you're probably a pretty great person!"
"> Obi-Wan is my hero

FTFY"
Well it happens when one gets older :/
Actually makes sense to me because when I was a kid I thought Obi-wan lost his fight against Vader because his light saber ran out of power.  It’s because he holds it at a funny angle sometimes and makes it look a foot long.
that's what happens when you don't change the batteries.
"I didnt like the stylized look at first, but it grew on me. Rebels art direction was very heavily leaning into the original Ralph McQuarrie concept art, which had skinny sabers. Also the new elements, like droids, ships and aliens in that series are almost straight from those old concepts. Even vader's helmet is stylized to fit an original design."
I feel the same way.
It looked better when they were in action but I agree. I always thought it was a weird decision because there is no way its not on purpose.
I don't like it either. Too skinny
"I'm actually the exact opposite. I LOVE the thin lightsabers. Something about it is just so cool and deadly, like a finely focused laser. Also reminds me a bit of a Rapier in terms of how thin it is. I just love it, I know I'm the odd one out but I wish they looked like that in other media too."
"I didn't  even bother trying watching the show because of this, it bothered me that much."
It's caused the whole show is based off the concept art for the prequels. I think it fits well imo.
Clone Wars Obi was my idol. I wanted to be like him so bad lol.
I don’t understand the art style choice of the thin light saber. It looks like a toothpick.
https://www.starwars.com/news/ralph-mcquarries-most-memorable-masterpieces
"The screenshot of Rebels here is right before he switches into the more Samurai like pose of ANH. Really nice attention to detail, showing him move from his old style to the one used in the OT."
"Why?  It was the original vision for them, back in the mid-70's, and how they looked in all of Ralph's concept art before the films came out:  https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MCQ_IA_12.jpg"
Rebels too some design cues from Ralph Macquarie's (sp?) concept art for ANH.
"I feel like I’m taking crazy pills in this thread. I remember seeing it at the movies, would’ve be 17/18, and I thought it was so try-hard looking even then. And then he bloody does it again less than a minute later. Just straight up looked like an idiot. Pretty sure it was only done because at the time the Matrix had re-popularised the ass-kicking pose with the “Bring It” hand. And this two finger bullshit was meant to be a SW version of that."
"Also call Soresu , one of the best defensive form."
It’s super cringe dude. You’re not alone.
Theres literally 3 times he does it in that screenshot alone... He does it all the time throughout the clone wars
Thats how lightsaber were originaly intended to look like in the early concept of star wars
It’s totally fucking dorky. It’s mental how people think it’s cool.
Creative changes made in Animation. The lightsabers in Rebels are designed to look like original concept art from the Original trilogy.
You must be fun at parties
"I think it's trying to match the looks of ANH lightsabers, which has a noticeably thinner ""core"" (especially in the Death Star Obi vs Vader scene).

But it does look like an ice-pick from this angle."
"Just a different animation style. Also, we have no reason to believe the Kenobi series won’t be consistent, seeing Filoni as involved as he is"
The last one looks like a glowing pen fitted in a holder!
Hehe master windup.
He certainly did
Mace was just winding him up.
"His fight with Anakin and Grievous in Revenge of the Sith are both pretty spot on for this to be the case.

With Anakin, he's mostly losing ground until he slices him up in a counter. 

Grievous, he was mostly looking for openings and weaknesses, which is tough with all the cybernetic modifications Grievous had undergone. In the end, he had to rip Grievous' chestplate open and blast his internal organs. 

I'd highly recommend watching Obi-Wan's fights with this in mind. Even Maul in TPM, though he beats him with some textbook aggression and passion (Peace is a lie)."
"Yes. From this stance he normally slides other lightsabres down, blocking off his body rather than going straight into a slash like Anakin does. He's usually on the back foot against Grievous, Maul, and Anakin (in RotS) but he drags the fights out a lot more with blocks to make use of his surroundings."
go check out jensaarai1 on youtube dude knows more about lightsaber forms than anyone.
Episode 3 novelization. Dooku says something like this
"The ""lightsaber forms"" have been referenced here and there but I dont think the exact forms themselves have like Soresu or Juyo or Shii-cho. 

In Fallen Order when Cal first confronts the Second Inquisitor, she says ""I recognize that stance"" as a reference to probably standard training."
The Clone wars is canon
The forms were referenced in the official visual dictionaries for the prequel trilogy
Clone Wars is canon
You remember correctly.
"Good question! 

Think about it this way - Soresu was made to be defensive: keep up an impenetrable barrier of movement that can be maintained for a very long period of time. In a sense, just draining the energy from the opponent slowly much like a parasitic space power bat on cables of ships!"
Cause they had to reference something from the movies. For example: Form I is the way of the Sarlacc for a similarly arbitrary reason.
It means whatever he's pointing at is going to get its ass kicked next...
"In tai chi sword forms, the finger channels your chi or internal energy and serves as an energetic and physical balance to the weapon."
"I would read that as being sorta a force wielding focus.  

I think that gesture is similar to how you might posture a parrying dagger, but the the force instead.

I mean, if you had a battlemage that preferred the sword to the spell, they might use a wand similarly."
You're move.
Captain Insano shows no mercy.
"Nah, he adopted the style after qui gon got merked"
It's amazing how so much happens in such a short time. Such beautiful nuance
the problem was the fight everyone was waiting for was a really long 1v1 to the death instead of kenobi winning in 2 seconds.
Understanding how he baited maul into that attack was what made it so great. It’s subtle but once you realize it’s fantastic.
"It’s people too programmed by the prequel fights that mainly criticize this. They forget that the lightsaber fights have more to do with the emotions and conflict between the two fighting, rather than the spectacle of the fight."
It's legit Obi-Wan's best duel. He wiped the floor with Maul in 3 moves. And going deeper than that there's so much more to the duel the more you think about it.
It’s not a story the three stooges would tell you.
"Agreed. Force Poke was in the original move set for Jedi: Fallen Order, but was (rightfully) removed for being way too OP."
"I see you have mastered Goku's ""Rock, Scissors 'N' Paper"" technique"
Do you know the names of these techniques?
"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?"
"Just try it though. Either you focus on your fingers, in which case your opponent is out of focus and your fingers ironically are the distraction. Or you focus on your opponent, in which case your fingers will appear blurry and don't help at all.

Now, if you're half blind, you could argue that it helps you judge the distance through parallax movement, but other than that it's hard for me to imagine a real world justification for the stance."
I love when people try applying real world logic to swords made of light wielded by super powered aliens.
"I'm no expert, but having done a fair bit of swordplay before, I found it to be a good transitional stance, especially if you're going to do a lot of parrying.

Edit: I forgot the post you were commenting on. The sword up top is great. I have no idea what the fingers are for."
I was the only kid who thought it looked like a Harry Potter pose.
Same here! My first memory is watching Spider-Man.
The art looked good but the show didn't really capture how it looked and it had a hard time pulling it off due to being 3d
"I really like the sound of it, but it always looks a bit... off in motion. Like they couldn’t quite commit to it."
I think Zebs species was based off wookie concept art as well.
I love how they portray the empire and the chain of command seeing the point of view form the officers was something i always fought the originals where lacking
Don't forget Zeb being proto-Chewie
It also fits with the narrowness of the blades in ANH.
"It is on purpose. It mimicks Ralph Mcquarrie's art, like almost everything in Rebels."
"https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MCQ_IA_12.jpg

Much of Rebels is based on the style of the original Star Wars concept art, as /u/Muisverriey said."
That’s what she said
I restarted clone wars series. It’s so good I’m excited for season 7
"I’m sure you know, but I love the fact that he moves into Qui-Gonns stance before Maul attacks. He knew that Maul would use the same attack that killed Qui-Gonn, but Obi-Wan knew just how to counter it."
"I respect Ralph McQuarries pieces because there’s a lot of genuinely amazing things he’s created. The thin lightsabers just don’t do it for me. I think if Rebels had been animated like a more stylized 2D show, the sabers might have worked better. In the actual show the blade literally looks like a needle. One of the coolest parts about lightsabers to me is that they’re thick beams of light and heat. The needle just isn’t the same (but I guess I’m glad they took some artistic risks)"
"Because McQuarries concept art was just that, concept art. Lucas changed it to the better in the actual films. Making them thin in rebels is just inconsistent, imo"
"yeah but if all you know are the movies, it's just weird and cringey. especially because the last frame has a cartoon of alec guinness doing it... it's hard for me to picture alec guiness' obi wan doing some karate stance like that."
"That makes sense, I think I just prefer the larger ""blades"" in the clone wars, still a fantastic scene"
I don’t follow...
"Its based on the concept art for A New Hope, not the screen look."
"It's actually copying the original drawn concept for lightsabers by Ralph McQuarrie, a designer who worked on the OT, [which were much more thin than even in ANH.](https://www.sideshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ralph_mcquarrie_05.jpg)"
All the sabers from Rebels are noticeabley thinner.
"That’s Kenobi, isn’t it?

“Master Wind-up!”

“You have no idea...”"
Whereas I'd be Master Letdown...
Obi Wan used Ataru when Qui Gon was alive. He switched to Soresu after TPM
"In the fight with Anakin he had to have accepted that he would most likely need to die to take out The chosen one. 
He just keeps defending, backing away and leading Anakin into more dangerous areas over and over. Just seeking a faint hint of a weakness to trip Anakin up and fall into the lava. Obi Wan is the baddest of badasses. 

Auralnauts do a hilarious take of this in their Fake Fight Commentary. https://youtu.be/ddNXFwHDMSY"
"I would like to nerd out here and point out that a style that focuses on perfect defense until an opening presents itself is perfect for a 4 armed lightsaber wielding cyborg. Not one saber could pierce his defense, but he found the openings to start trimming limbs and thats why he was sent to deal with Grievous, he was the perfect swordsman to counter him. A more offensive style wouldve lacked the capacity to defend against 4 lightsabers at once."
Windu also compliments him on his mastery of it.
Rebels makes reference to the forms as well.
"The ""I recognize that stance."" Line is followed by ""Who was your master?"" Which leads me to believe that Cal is stanced like his Master's form."
Yes. But the exact way the forms work is not canon. Just the principle of lightsaber forms.
Even the novelizations of the prequels are non-canon now so unfortunately that doesn’t mean much. I choose not to let the Mouse dictate what I believe to be canon but just saying
You explained that perfectly totally makes sense. I was expecting it to basically have no real reason apart from sounding cool. Thanks stranger!
"I wouldn’t say arbitrary, Form I is notorious for its heavy reliance on tentacle and vore based attacks right?"
You are move.
"This, after seeing what an offensive style did to his master he realized he needed to change strategies. He was a practitioner of the same form quigon used until that fateful day."
Ok that makes sense i love how people get triggered I was just asking a question
I like how second sister in Fallen Order uses the same stance as Maul does in the Two Suns.
Congrats for proving Gonzo's point.
"I think those people missed the point, it was a beautiful moment, and in the end Obi-Wan embraced Maul and gave him hope."
Spot on.
That’s why I love the fight in empire the way Vader moves calmly and is studying Luke’s actions to see how gifted he is and we know that if he really wanted to he could kill luke in a second I mean his using one hand most the time
"Also, I think there's also just a lot of people who aren't much for subtlety and depth."
Underrated comment.
I think another comment mentioned Tai Chi
It's not a story a Westerner would tell you.
"I once read a news article saying that commercial was racist because Mrs. Lee “bumbled in and ruined her husband’s secret like an idiot.”  Please, Mrs. Lee knew exactly what she was doing"
Agreed. Swinging around a massive chunk of iron is very different from a weightless blade. I never understood “sword experts” issue with it.
There is a karate strike that uses exactly this (to the eyes)
"This is heresy, but imo it looks better in stills than on screen."
And chopper was based off R2D2s concept too!
"But they weren't thin throughout ANH. It's an inconsistency that keeps getting corrected.
I think the Disney+ version has now corrected the thin ones in most of the instances they were left making Rebels stand out even more."
Oh me too for sure but I can’t say I’m the biggest fan of Anakins new look in the trailer
Wait what. The last ep of six leads right into ROTS.
This ain't a HEMA discussion. It's a discussion about a fairy tale set in space with magic warriors that can move faster than a laser beam. Realism and usefulness are the last things on anyone's minds.
"Oh that makes sense. After cutting Maul in half, he thought ""damn, I should probably work so that it doesn't happen to me"". lol jk but maybe he did idk, I'm not deep into non-film media"
"Yeah Qui-Gon was known as one of the most fierce warriors in offensive battle. Obi as his apprentice emulated this style and teaching until his Masters unfortunate demise. 

I'd speculate after witnessing said demise, between the scenes. Obi still uses said teachings but strengthened his overall technique with a more refined defensive style, one Qui-Gon didn't necessarily have. This lesson overall made him unquestionably the most dangerous Jedi in battle."
Best way to fight Form V
"""Affiliation: Jedi Master / Unknown"" lol"
"A lot of references, actually. Grand Inquisitor never shuts up about them."
Yea not my brightest moment but I'm sticking to it! Lol
"He also learned from Maul to use his surroundings. Maul goaded both Obi and Gin into an area that was confined knowing the Ataru would be ineffective due to the need to have space to make your attack and defence. 

He used a similar tactic with Anakin. 

The old cliche of ""learning from mistakes"" should have a picture of Obi next to it. The greatest student of the game."
And he still beat Maul’s ass with Quigon’s form.
Seems that force sensitivity can go many ways.
I'd rather see a 1v1 of 2 equally skilled fighters. Like we still could have got the whole give him hope ending in addition to a long 1v1.
"The lightsaber vs lightsaber fights in Fallen Order are great for this reason, while generally more frenetic than I would like (particularly at Master or above) most of them greatly benefit from a slow and methodical approach to combat. I tried to do as many as I could first time on Master and spent a good minute or more just blocking and dodging as I thought through how best to spam Push>Dash combo's without getting instagibbed.

It was great."
"For a show aimed at kids, it really shows the amount of love Dave Filoni has for Star Wars lore and details. The fact that he starts in his “Obi-Wan” stance, then moves to “Old Ben”, then finally to “Qui-Gonn” stance. Causing Maul to use the same attack that killed Qui-Gonn, but Obi-Wan was ready and knew how to counter it. Damn...so much significant detail for such a short scene."
"You can view lightsaber fights through a ""realistic"" lens just fine. Just because they're sword experts doesn't mean they have to look at everything as a giant claymore. Shadiversity (a rabbit hole channel full of storytelling and medieval discussion) has a few videos on lightsabers, and he had plenty of fair criticisms of lightsaber fights. For example, if we assume that lightsabers are completely weightless, and that no one will ever have any armor for us to pierce or slice through, then a stance like Obi Wan's would actually be a rather poor choice. Why hold your lightsaber so far back when a windup wouldn't do you any good? Your lightsaber is already going to cut through any armor on your opponent, so you don't need any extra force to cut through it. You would be better off having your lightsaber out in front of you, ready to quickly strike or block attacks. There are of course caveats to this criticism, such as the fact that your opponent's lightsaber essentially functions as the armor you need to break through, so you might need some windup to push down their block. Obi Wan might even have a better blocking ability if his own blocking swings have some windup to them (which makes sense with what some other comments were saying about Obi Wan being fond of the more defensive stance).

But this all just goes to show that you can apply classic sword fighting logic to lightsaber fights just fine. It's just a unique scenario with some interesting characteristics to take into account."
"Ah, Path of The Stooges Three, I know it well"
I think I read a comment in this sub that said the story arcs in season 7 take place during ROTS? I’d like more clarification too.
Who is talking about HEMA?
"IIRC the reason was because Ataru was a style that focused more on acrobatics, which matched up very poorly against Darth Maul's style."
"> After cutting Maul in half, he thought ""damn, I should probably work so that it doesn't happen to me"".

Then he taught his Padawan the same thing. Anakin being Anakin heard him, but didn't really LISTEN. ""Throw my enemy down a generator shaft. Got it.""

However many years later..."
Not the most dangerous Jedi in battle but the hardest to win against.
"It's brilliant. 

""So many rookie errors"""
"I’m not saying he didn’t, the battle taught him a valuable lesson that cost his friend and mentor his life, whereas if he had the other form at his disposal he could have lasted longer (Qui-gon)."
"I loved that part. The fight was decided before they ever crossed sabers. And the dialogue was really well written too. Maul was consumed by hatred and revenge, that was all he knew."
Filoni is the best
"Yeah, we 100% can say how a fictional weapon with certain properties would be best used, even if there is no direct real world parallel. Fantasy or not, even a superhuman body has some things in common with a real one, so that's not really a problem either.

[Here's the video u/lurmurt mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpdTooRUbv4)"
"The last arc of the series should take place at the beginning of RotS. 

Spoilers for the arc:  
>!Anakin and Obi-Wan need to go to Mandalore, but are called away because Palatine has been kidnapped!<"
"Oh my God, that's your reply? You really must be fun at parties chief."
"It’s not quite that it didn’t match up poorly (Yoda is THE master of Ataru), it’s that he was just outmatched for the majority of the fight. Maul, Qui-gon, and Obi-wan all used Ataru, but only Maul was much better at it with multiple opponents (specifically a variant of Jar’Kai and some Shien in TPM). 

Since Obi-wan was a padawan during that movie, it made sense to see his evolution from a flashy form to a more thoughtful and patient Soresu as his character arc progressed."
A Jedi must also become proficient in the current form before moving on to the next form
"Haha now we know why he took so long to actually throw Palatine. ""Fuck... what was it obi-wan said again? Something about his shaft?""."
i meant their final battle!
"Then when Obi Wan struck him down, all that anger and hate dissipated in an instant and was replaced by sadness and regret. Maul’s last words, “He...will avenge us”, perfectly sum up his feelings upon his death."
"> The fight was decided before they ever crossed sabers.

""No...protecting some*one*!""


That was the moment Kenobi knew Maul was a goner."
"Sorry I thought this was a discussion about Obi-wan’s battle stance on which I gave a description of its lack of defence, to which you responded by insulting me personally and stating I must not be a particularly enjoyable party guest. I’m just not following you at all."
"Didn't Maul also have a lot of of Form VII in his repertoire? Qui-Gon in general just didn't have the defensive skills for how much aggression Maul had, and I think that's the main reason Obi-Wan changed to the defensive style."
"I always thought that the only requirement is to be proficient in form I, seeing that it introduces the basic zones of attack and defense for lightsaber combat in its most basic form.

Once Padawans are proficient with form I, they get to move on to form II to VI, depending on what their master uses or what they are comfortable with. Form VII was always kind of restricted to Jedi Masters and advanced members of the order due to Juyo being thought of as dangerous, considering it uses a heavy emotional aspect that Padawans and young Knights might not be able to control.

Was I wrong?"
"I've always found this to be the most poignant moment in this fight. Even when dying, all Maul can think of is revenge, while Obi Wan thinks of it only as the best course of action."
"Another part is that Ataru uses a lot of Force-powered acrobatics. At Qui Gon's age, this fatigued him quickly. The form is not suitable for protracted fights.

Another thing to note is the final fight between Maul and Obi Wan in Rebels. Obi Wan initially uses a Soresu stance and then changes to Ataru. Maul's eyes widen and notice the change in Form. They stare each other down, Maul launches himself forward and unleashes a flurry of attacks, including the hilt attack he used to stun Qui Gon. This proves to be his undoing, Obi Wan, having learnt from his master's mistake, slashes through both hilt and Maul."
"Juyo/Vaapad may be a factor given how far he had been turned to the dark side by the Night Sisters and Savage. I’d think that the aggression comes more from Shien (repetitive and forceful attacks) versus the very delicate balance that is needed for Vaapad (as seen in Windu). 

I’m more of the mind that his form changed as he realized his own mind was drifting away from the initial tenets of the Jedi. Qui-gon, for all his amazing prowess and skills as a Jedi Master, was a grey Jedi - one that didn’t follow the Order’s code to the letter. Rather than follow a path that allowed for retaliation, he followed a path that prescribed negotiation."
Maul was used and fucked over his whole life. Revenge was all he had.
"Sam Witwer (Voice of Darth Maul and legendary Star Wars nerd, hell, nerd in general) explains this entire fight sequence so eloquently and perfectly in this video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n3vp15a_Bg4

It really is worth a watch. The insight coming from Darth Maul himself, plus you get to see just *how much* he truly cares about it all."
"That episode was the end Maul deserved. I may have cried a little, but that is hearsay."

you're probably not fun at parties are you

meaning everyone consented to it.
Ok boomer
"1 I've seen people use ok retard since before the ok boomer fiasco.

2 What in the fuck do you mean n word? It's just a dismissive insult."
meaning there was no opposition to it
it was sarcastic you unoriginal potato
was it really so hard to get the sarcasm?

It's still sexual assault.
Ok boomer
Stop digging a hole you uncultured drillbit

"Nah bruh, it ain't."
Please tell me that was sarcasm
"It’s rape.

edit : jesus christ reddit, it was obvious sarcasm"
i'm probably younger than you and was referring to the tweet comparing the two words you frozen big mac
it was precisely that that i was referring to sarcastically..... didnt think a /s was so important..... well lesson learned i guess
"It’s one of few words that has as much if not more history behind it as he n word.  The mentally handicapped have always existed, do you think they were historically treated well?  They were treated like dumbfucks and exploited"

Uh-huh yeah sure

Comment
"My grandmother has the parents buy the grandkids gifts and my favorite part is her always saying ""Come show Granny what I got you."" I'm 36 and it has been that way for at least the last 30  years.

Edit: The tradition has continued with my kids (her great-grandkids). She is 87 this year."
"When I was a kid, my mom handed me a present and my dad, hungover, said, “that’s from both of us”. The card said: From Santa. It was very confusing.

But that’s when I learned that Santa “was bullshit” and “these damned kids need to understand where what they get comes from”.

We understood. Thanks, mom."
I have to math out how old I am and you expect me to remember what’s in the box? A month from now I’m going to be Brad Pitt at the end of Seven.
I wish my dad was back from the store to be surprised
Am I the only dad here that gets stoked on the kids presents?
The best is when it’s got a heft price tag - that forced smile with an *“Oh!  We bought them a Playstation **and** games?”*
u/RepostSleuthBot I swear this gets posted once a month

"I am a dad and I love shopping for presents! Catalogs, Amazon - so much fun."
"My wife tells me all the time what she gets, and I still forget. I'm totally this dad."
I call posting this next
My dad bought me a gift on his own two or three times in his life. My brother is still mad.
My mom also shops on behalf of their dogs to give us extra presents. Moms single handedly make Christmas.
"I have done this more than once: ""Oh that's a cool gift, who got you that?""

""you did.... Thanks...."""
"This previous spring I was helping my dad with some yardwork, I needed a knife so he handed me a really nice one that I hadn't seen before. I asked him where he got the knife and he told me ""I'm pretty sure you gave it to me christmas this year"""
It’s so weird how we all have the exact same childhood

"Remarkable fucking title, buddy boy"
I always go and pick out something for each of my girls just from me and my wife and I usually go over the whole gift list before thanksgiving so we have a plan in place.
"Dad did his part. How’s that electricity treating you? Your bed warm, that pillow feel nice?  Clean socks and a safe place to lay your head? That’s Dad Love. That kiss on the head at bedtime and “I love you too, kiddo”. He’s at the power plant, mill, fire station, loading dock or construction site thinking  (like Homer) “Do It For Her”.  I had Dad and now I am Dad. The pay is shitte. But, the benefits... spectacular. We love you, so much. If we don’t say it enough, I’m sorry. My communication skills sometimes let me down. I hope my actions make up for those shortcomings.  Now, beloved. Show me what your Mother and I got you."

Wow, only the 8th time this has been posted! Check my history, I posted it a while ago and there are multiple others too."
"Yep, this is me when the wife hands out gifts to the in-laws."
Nailed it.
"My wife the night before Christmas looked at me dead pan and said ""This isn't enough presents go get something"" I got up went down to the local drug store that happened to still be open, picked up two presents came home she wrapped them. The next morning I wasn't quite awake and still had no clue what the hell the extra presents were."
Dad? Are you there???? No...
So same
As a dad I can concur.
Why is that? & it’s so VERY true!!!!
" Opposite is true for me.  My mom couldn’t act surprised , she was drunk passed out on the couch. However my dad seem to memorize what gift was in each box"
"In my family, my sisters and I were always surprised to find out what we bought our mom that year."
"My family does secret santa in pairs. Last year me and my sister had our parents as santa, my dad was very surprised with what he got me."
"The best part is when he forgets and asks ""what is that"""
"This happens in my house, but there are also gifts for my dad that say they’re from my mom and I and I have no idea what they are. Although once he opens them I sometimes remember my mom telling me about them."
"In my family “From Mom and Dad” means clothes. 

The unlabeled packages is the good stuff. 

However, now that I’m grown I like the clothes too."
"My dad went to get milk 17 years ago.
Never came back"
"My mom used to buy herself a gift and say it was from my dad... She would get him to open it too ""I wonder what I got you this year?!"". 

They loved the tradition and it worked for them hahaha"
BASEBALL STUFF
"I don’t, get it?"
I wish. I’m the dad of three boys. My wife has no idea what they’re getting.
My whole life (30+ years) I can tell which gift my dad actually picked. It will look like a gorilla wrapped it and dad will be smiling and giggling the whole time. Some years it's a prank and some years it's tickets for some amazing father/son experience. Either way I always save it for last just to see how pumped he gets.
There's a reason this isn't on /r/BlackPeopleTwitter...
Just like when you were born
And yet you still have to thank him lmao

I know the big things my two year old daughter gets. Anyone else their guess is as good as mine.
"Yup. When she goes “this is from the both of us”, you know he has no idea what it is"

'tis the season for this to be reposted again
As a dad this is 100% correct
"My dad used to be the neighborhood Santa.
So he knew what everyone’s presents were!

And then he died when I was five and my mom told me Santa wasn’t real."
"It was my sons birthday yesterday. He loved his gift. I still don't know what we got him. All I know it was over 250 euros.
+we went gocarting and played pinball."
Mom's Fly. Dad's Buy
HA HA! Look who's on babysitter duty today!
"This is basic dad economics. 

For example, I have two kids. If I know what my kids gifts are, we we only get the benefit of surprising two people. If I am also surprised, we get the added value of a whole other person's surprisedness. That's a 33% increase at no extra cost.

They explain it all in a class that comes after the prenatal class but before the dad joke class."
Am Dad.  Is true.
"Well, hè prob be paying for that sh*t to."
Dads money bought it tho
Mum should stopping shopping for shit for the kids in November then....
As a dad I can vouch for this.
"I always thought that ""from Mom & dad"" meant mom picked it out and bought it with dads money."
Ya he's probably wondering what he spent his money on for sure.
He probably paid for it though
Surprised how much of his money mom spent on ur ass
I just love this.... What a loving grandmother.
This is actually pretty awesome. Your grandmother cares enough to try to get you something that you want and knows your parents will know best in this department. My grandmother would always forget about mine or would always give me some stupid gift card to some place that I never went.
"My grandma used to chuckle when we'd give her a thank you hug saying ""Oh, what'd I get you?!"""
"We always take turns opening a gift, with everyone watching, then grab a gift from under the tree for someone else to open (can't pick one for yourself!), and then go and thank who our gift was from (if they are present), while the next person is opening theirs. This should have made it easier for Dad, yet every year when I thanked him, he would go: ""What did I get you?""  It is just part of the traditions :-)"
Aw that's cute
Strange. A grandmother who still has her parents alive and kids who are 87 yo females.
"Grandmas are a gift to this world, my grandma is the most supportive person ever, whenever I ho see her i leave feeling amazing about myself, constant compliments, encouragement and of course great food that she forces me to take home with me.

Idk if its a generational thing from the greatest gen or if I just got lucky because all the elderly people in my life are amazing."
She will die soon
"Wait, Santa isn't real?"
"I never understood kids getting wrapped parents with cards that said ""from Santa."" At my house, the family exchanged wrapped presents on Christmas Eve. The Stantas stuff appeared under the tree (unwrapped, of course), on Christmas morning. No tags needed ... you knew Santa brought that shit."
That wasn't any hangover. That's your old man feeling the effects of working his ass off all year to provide food and shelter and realizing his kids will just end up thanking their mommy because she got you a Nintendo.
"As long as your happy, right?"
Yes I expect you to have common decency dad. You fucking suck. You only ever spent time with me when it was YOUR activities. You never paintballed with me or helped me work on my high end RC cars and planes. I hate you
I’m sure he’ll find that packet of smokes any day now.

"It is curious that these jokes resurface so often. It’s funny, sure, but it seems like there’s a lot of truth into it.

I’m a guy with no kids but I enjoy surprising people I care about with a gift. I’d think I’d feel the same way with my kids when (or if) I ever become a dad."
"My dad travelled a lot for work when I was a kid, but he was usually the annual gift giver! He'd mail Christmas gifts and my mom would wrap them and put them under the tree. For the Christmases when Dad wasn't home, mom would buy smaller gifts so we could open something when my dad was able to come home."
"That’s nice. I feel like these kinds of jokes perpetuate this negative stereotype of the emotionally uninvolved father, and as we can see from your comment and many of the replies, it just isn’t true across the board."
My  husband does 75% of the shopping for the kids gifts. He loves it! There are SO MANY jokes about Dad's being useless at gift giving and it really drives him (and me nuts).
"Dude, my dad loved buying presents and wrapping them for us more than humanly possible. He’d do scavenger hunts for our big presents. 

Christmas hasn’t been the same since he passed away when I was in high school. But I wouldnt trade those memories for the world. Looking back it makes me realize how much my dad cared about making me smile. I hope your kids think the same of you as they reflect on Christmas memories."
"Nope, my husband gets as excited as I do for buying her gifts."
"My dad rarely even writes his own name in the card, let alone get involved in buying presents. He's early 70s now so it might be a generational thing."
Totally. I love being an uncle to 4 yr old twin boys. I get to get them super cool gifts that my 27 year old ass would probably have fun with too. They won't be getting clothes from me!
"no. most dads are the primary breadwinners and therefore are buying the presents in the first place. My dad was the one who got me good presents like a play station, dirt bike or computer games. My mom got me clothes and shit."
"When the Wii came out,my sister and I asked for it. My mom and Dad had no idea where to get it so they took us to the mall the week before christmas bought it with us and made us wait till christmas to open it"

"> knows your parents will know best in this department

Really?  Damn I had the wrong parents."
My grandma has given me the same axe body spray kit from walmart for three years running. I know I have odor problems but fuck me.
My grandmother would ask me what I wanted directly then sign the gifts from Santa.
As an uncle I can't imagine asking my siblings to buy their own kids an extra gift to put my name on it. Like yeah they know their kids better than me but that isn't really the point...
It sounds like your grandma still cares enough to get you a present at all. Comparisons can make anyone in the world seem bad or lesser than others.
Santa is op’s mom
Don’t listen to him. Santa is real
My family did it the same way but I think Santa usually wrapped stuff.

I also forget some things that I bought and wrapped early in the season..."
"My dad got excited about the gift opening itself but not a big fan of buying it. He got stoked for Christmas, would creep around in the middle of the night leaving little clues that Santa had been there and was excited enough to wake up 2 hours later for us to open shit. He wasn't about to buy the shit though. He hates shopping and thinks everything is too expensive so he'd rather not know how much the toys cost. The buying and wrapping was all mom because if dad wrapped it, it'd be in the shopping bag from the store with duck tape all around it. A few years ago I watched him wrap a Roomba for my mom, it was wrapped in a tarp with duck tape."
"To be fair, he's talking about his specific dad."
"Any good Dad can relate to this, whether they were a trucker who spend 2 weeks away from home every month, or a 9-5'r who left the Xmas shopping to Mom, since she was a homemaker.

"My dad is probably one of the most involved fathers out there. Always helped with HW, cooked dinner, went to teacher parent conferences with my mom, volunteered for field trips, drove us to school, drove us everywhere basically. My mom still buys all the gifts. The only person my dad buys a gift for is my mom and he still needs help."
"I think it's true for a lot of us with boomer parents. I don't see this happening as often with parents in their 40s or younger. 


I had a traditional boomer dad and he didn't have anything to do with us unless it was convenient for him--never participated in child rearing, chores, etc. Shouted at us for being six years old without the hand eye coordination of an adult (God forbid we spill something). My mom worked just as many hours as my dad, but in addition to working she had to do 100% of the ""woman shit"" like cooking, cleaning, raising the children, etc. 



They're part of the awkward generational shift from men being the sole earners/women being domestic, to women being in the workforce but still expected to do everything at home."
"I mean, I think it’s just meant for a sub of people that you don’t belong to. The first time I saw this post, I died laughing because it was so relatable. When I repeated it to my family over the following Christmas, everyone about peed. Great family memory right there. No malice or stereotyping, just truth. I’d noticed for years that Santa always has the same handwriting as mom, and now we can joke about it."
"I like to look at them through the veil of my father. He *wraps* the gifts, stares at em for hours, horribly messes up, rewraps them three times because he never puts tags on, finishes an hour before midnight, and he *still* has no idea what gifts he got everyone. 

Some dad's just have that amazing ability to selectively forget things. He can remember every showtime he's ever heard, but heaven forbid he knows what he just put in a bag two seconds ago."
"It's because any emotion has been sucked out of us once we join the work force. Don't forget that while workers are *more efficient* when working only 32 hours a week they are also *more cognizant* of how fucked our capitalist society is. How fucked it is we will literally have to work our entire lives away to an unappreciative entity so we can have the chance at being merely *sustainable* when we are less capable. How fucked it is that instead of enjoying things in life we find the quickest and cheapest way to meet our needs because otherwise we have no free time. Slavery didn't go away, it just got better PR."
"Because it was our grandfathers, our fathers where in a generation where mothers where approaching to the workforce more than our grandmothers did and in our generetaion the % of mothers in the workforce is even higher, a consequence for that is that roles are more fluid, dads do chores too, are more caring, i see dads in the supermarkets, at the doctor with the kids, they take the kids to gimnastic, dance, karate etc...my dad can name at least 20 of my friends and most of the coworkers i had in my life and i am glad they do this things too. 

I'm sick of both sexes shaming on the other, it is leading to a generation where males are seen as expendable, useless sperm donors and rapist and females as children ovens, gold diggers, awalt and is not true nor healty for both."
My husband gives awesome gifts as well! He is great at shopping for people

This is exactly why I wait until 2am Christmas morning to wrap shit. Yep, totally, not because I loathe wrapping things at all."
"That’s great that your dad is so involved in the Christmas thing! The clues sound really cute and fun. However, I think the point here is that the whole process of thinking up good gifts to meet your kids interests and going to the store probably multiple times during the holiday rush is just much more of a mental burden and time commitment. Also no one is born good at wrapping presents, they get good because they practice at it and because it’s a good way to show that you care. A two minute YouTube video could show you how, so to not take that initiative says something about the varying expectations between parents."
"I feel like you’re missing my point. That a lot of people find this relatable suggest that there are a lot of inattentive dads out there. Not the most surprising thing in the world, but there’s a bit of anguish in my laughter over this meme.

It could be due to the fact I never knew my father, as he died when I was very young by his own hand. I would like to think that he’d be excited to give me presents on Christmas. Anyway. I’m thinking way too hard about a stupid meme, which means I need to go to bed."

"It was the opposite for me growing up. For christmas Dad would buy me cool things like a bike, video games, remote controlled cars. And my mom would buy me lame shit like clothes, a universal remote, (only had 1 tv when i was 10 lol) dress shoes she wanted me to have, etc."

I hate wrapping so much. I'm a single parent so I do it all and every year it ends up Christmas eve with not a damn thing wrapped and I get to pull an all nighter getting things wrapped. I didn't wrap last year because I was trying to get 3 hours of sleep but I had other shit to do so I still didn't get to go to bed that night. I don't really place that much importance on the wrapping because I literally just don't have time for it.
"Its because women have been taking on the brunt of emotional labor/ mental load for generations, and now with women entering the workforce, they are still expected to do both. 

Things like buying the kids presents, remembering family's birthdays, scheduling doctors appointments, remembering/creating plans for the family, many chores, etc tend to fall on the woman, because otherwise they would get forgotten. If she chooses to stop doing these things, the family suffers, including the husband, who would probably blame the wife. 

Theres a comic that explains this really well:

There was also a really sad video on some talk show (cant remember which) where they asked a dad in front of the kids things like, who is their family doctor, what are their best friends names, etc. He missed a lot of questions while mom got them all. And while we dont know if the mom works, dad should really at least *know* these things. 

Of course *not all dads or husbands* but if any of this stuff is unknown to you, maybe you arent as involved as you could be. My one question would be, on your mothers birthday, does your wife remind you? Does she get her a present for her, or tell you to wish her a happy birthday?"
"Hey dude, I’ve been adopted by the sweetest three year old girl who’s dad skilled himself last year. Is there any advice you could share? Things that helped you or that you wish you had or hadn’t done or known?"
"I think you'r inferring a lot about why.

Many attentive dads will be the exact same way."
"me : ""Does this shirt fit me? - yes""

me : ""Does this shirt feel comfortable? - Yes""

me : ""Ok, I'll buy it""

wife: ""But it's purple, with orange and yellow polkadots with green stripes, why the hell would you want that?""

me: ""good point, I guess I'll just get the generic *insert colour of the season here* shirt"""
Nah.
Its better and easier for grandma instead having to gift them something she has no idea they will enjoy? Idk about you but my grandma has no idea what half of the things i wish for is.
"Because sometimes,  presents are so specific that you don't want to risk getting the wrong one. 

I don't understand why everyone is do agitated by this.  I keep a curated wishlist on my Amazon account so that my husband and family get me exactly what I want for Christmas.  Otherwise,  when I ask for a cookbook or tool,  even if I describe all the little details I'm looking for,  they'll always run the risk of getting something a little bit off."
"Yeah, I have asked them and the answer is always “there’s no budget, buy him what you think he wants” 

But they are frugal, so it’s tricky, if I buy something that they feel is too expensive they will pay but will make comments about it. So it’s frustrating AF. Too expensive also ranges from time to time so I don’t even know man. At the end they will make their little comments anyways and if I say “just buy it yourself” then I’m rude. 

So yeah, it’s not cute or endearing, it’s lazy and puts the burden of the gift on the parents."
I was given a pack of beef jerky from the grocery store.
I am curious about this too....
He’s a good dad and a good man. He just wasn’t around a lot. I forgive him.
"Maybe get things gift wrapped while you’re in the store or when your order it online? Presents probably take me about 2 minutes a piece (except last year when I had to wrap a tagine, that took longer lol) but that may not be the case for everyone. If you really hate wrapping things you can also just use bags and tissue paper. My point is just that there’s a lot of ways somebody can passingly get things wrapped other than just saying that it’s not their thing and putting it on a partner."
"Man, that was my mom 100%. My dad absolutely refused to do ""woman things"" like cooking, cleaning, child rearing, any chores, etc. When we were born, my dad made her change all the diapers, made her get up in the middle of the night, etc...... Despite the fact that they BOTH WORKED. 


He never touched us except when it was convenient for him. Thankfully I think this mentality is slowly dying out with the boomers (my folks), I've got friends in their 40s with kids and very attentive husbands who enjoy raising their children."
"After reading that comic, brb doing a lot of introspection"
"I mean for christmas my mom would buy shit like clothes. my dad would buy me cool shit i actually wanted like video games. So i think this ""stereotype"" is pretty bullshit anyway."
Excellent comment.
"I disagree with the sentiment that because my wife is in charge of the day to day task list for the household that I am somehow not contributing equally. I disagree with the implied notion that her work is somehow less important or that this work is being thrust upon her.

That workload is identical to what one would hire an estate manager or majordomo for. Were she not doing all that there's no way I would have been able to grow my career and our income to the comfortable level we have achieved. I would have been too distracted by the constant little nuisances that crop up to put in the same level of effort."
"The reality is that men and women simply take on different roles in society. Let me demonstrate for you:

Its because men have been taking on the brunt of emotional labor/ mental load for generations, and now with men taking on more responsibilities in the home, they are still expected to do both.

Things like changing the oil, putting on winter tires, remembering to blow out the sprinkler lines before the frost, repairing a cracked foundation, scheduling preventative maintenance on the plumbing system, etc tend to fall on the man, because otherwise they would get forgotten. If he chooses to stop doing these things, the family suffers, including the wife, who would probably blame the husband.

Theres a comedic tv clip that showss this really well:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fnfeuoh4s8

Also, that clip you are referring to is from Jimmy Kimmel. They asked a lot of people and showed the worst/funniest answers. If anything that demonstrates that a man not knowing about these things is deemed to be funnier than a woman not knowing. One could argue that is a result of the matriarchy trying to keep men down.

I know it's great to be a victim these days please don't perpetuate these myths from extremist man-hating false feminists."
Lazy
She can ask
I’d be pretty happy with that tbh
"Are you sure you forgive him though? I think to forgive someone, you have to be able to move past it."
I disagree
Yeah.
"Its not she doesnt ask, its that she doesnt what that item is. For example, if i explain to her that a test light is to test voltage on electrical components she is pretty much in the same place as before."
"Not to interject but there's the concept of ""forgive and forget.""

You can forgive that someone did something, but never forget it.

To use a very transactional example. You could loan someone money and then forgive their debt but because you know that they didn't pay you back the first time you never loan them money again.

So that's an example of forgiving and not forgetting."
"""Now Jimmy, Christmas is coming up. What would you like Santa to bring you?"" 

""OH OH I want a voltage test light and some conical flasks please Santa!""

(I'm not taking the piss, just made me laugh in my sleep deprived brain this morning)."
Comment
This is still valid anywhere in New Jersey.
"Back in high school, I went to a concert with a friend, and one of my favorite bands was playing (The Reign of Kindo).
Right when they took the stage, my friend said he had to go because he had a curfew, so we asked the lead singer to talk to his dad on the phone and ask if he could stay for the show.

This dude grabbed my friend’s phone live on stage, in the middle of his set, and asked if my buddy could stay. It was epic.


His dad said no and he had to leave :("
"[Here's a pic of the kid and the signed note.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/03/19/Springsteen_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpJliwavx4coWFCaEkEsb3kvxIt-lGGWCWqwLa_RXJU8.jpg?imwidth=1400)

Also: 

>Oh, in case you were wondering about Ms. Jackson, Kim asked if she accepted the note.  
>  
>“Yeah, totally!” says Xabi."
"That kid's name?

Jon Bon Jovi."
I was late because the highway was jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive.
"Well, we bursted out of class
Had to get away from those fools
We learned more from a three-minute record, baby
Than we ever learned in school"
Xabi?
"John Cleese one time signed a note for me to give to my Spanish teacher because I missed class to go to his show. The note just said ""He spent his time more wisely. John Cleese"" 

I gave the professor the note, and he liked it so much I wasn't marked absent."
Never thought I'd see the Claremont Courier on Reddit....
"Well, he is the boss.

The teachers hands were tied at that point."
“I don’t feel tardy...”
"This is such an amazing, touching story.

Though I'm vaguely amused and disgusted by one of the comments, which is some religious asshat trying to tell people Springsteen sucks and that ""God hates our culture"".

That's what I never understood about these religious sorts; you'd think they would realize that if they want to convince people to follow them or their god, maybe they shouldn't insult the things those people love right out of the gate."
Is bruce springsteen the tom hanks of rock & roll?
Springsteen and the e street band are some of the most insane live performancers going around.  They have a list of like 200 songs that they play and quite often Springsteen takes requests from the audiences.. essentially for some parts of their shows there is no set list so they literally have to be practising 200 songs to be ready to play any of them in any order with a few mins notice..
If someone wrote “He’s be late to school tomorrow” then that person should really stay in school.
"""He's the boss""

-teacher"
Did it work?
*Thanks Cracked*
Teacher couldn't do anything either b/c Springsteen is in fact the Boss
Some say that kid is still out there somewhere dancing in the dark
Tori Amos did the same thing for me in high school
"The teacher took the note, sold it for $150,000 and retired early."
That’s why he’s The Boss.
"I don't like his music, but I've only ever heard good things about the man"
"School Superintendent - ""Are you for eeeeells?"""
"'Cause tramps like us, baby, we were born to run'"
"Ah, I see you also still read Cracked."
Ironically Bruce Springsteen had already planned a cover of “Ms. Jackson” by OutKast
Is Xabi short for Xavier? Like either way it’s a pretty rock and roll name.  I feel like this kid probably didn’t need a note from the Boss.  Just gratuitous rock and roll shenanigans.
Maybe not as big as The Boss but Terry Pratchett once did a book signing here. We were on our lunch break from school and never got to meet him but the book shop allowed us to leave our purchased books for him to sign. Some bright spark had an English class after lunch so got Pratchett to write her a note excusing her for being late.
My mom was in high school in 1983 when the Sixers won the championship. My grandfather wrote her an absent note for her return the next day saying she was out to see the doctor. He just didn't write that it was Dr. J (Julius Erving).
An article from my hometown newspaper!
"Is that note more or less, ""I'm sorry Ms. Jackson. I am for real.""?"
"""he's be late to school tomorrow""

Did Bruce pity his poor English or what?"
I'm sorry miss Jackson but I am for real.
"Went to a Sleater Kinny show in 2001. Super, drunk. Make outs possible"
And that kid grew up to become Xabi Alonso
Bruce Springsteen was so boss.
That’s only one reason out of about 5 million why he is both my favorite musician and celebrity in general
"The note actually read, 'I'm sorry Ms Jackson, Xabi's for real.'"
"TIL there's a kid named ""Xabi""."
"A kid came in late to my class one day in HS, drinking a Chick-fil-a drink and just walks to his seat. Teacher asks if he has a note and he says, oh yeah, sorry. Walks back up to her and hands her a Chick-fil-a napkin that says, ""Judd's gonna be late. -Chick-fil-a"""
"I, too, read cracked.com

https://www.cracked.com/article_26849_5-times-celebs-looked-out-their-biggest-fans.html"
"I’m just here because the Courier has such a homely, 80’s logo."
I read that quote in his voice.
I imagine that note would eventually be worth something. I'd make the trade.
There's no way he'd give the note to his teacher... a photocopy perhaps
"I mean, this is cool and all but 10:30am is stretching it a bit."
r/MadeMeSmile
I'M SORREH MISS JACKSON... OOOOOO
">“The Ticketmaster Gods gave us first-ow tickets on the side of the stage at that show,” Mr.?Glovsky.

what??lamfo. why did you have to inscribe his cockney british? what is happening?"
That kid went onto play midfield for Real Madrid
If he was at an OutKast concert I have a good feeling about what the note would say...
10 times out of 9
For some reason my brain thought the last sentence was ‘Please execute him if he is tardy”.
Not too Xabi.
"I hate when I'm tardy, but I hate it even more when I don't tardy right the first time and have to re-tardy."
">
Baby, we we're born to run...
Not to skip class.

Every teacher in Jersey."
I'm tardy :D
Oh yeah I remember that much from ochem
Who tf be walking around named Xabi
So cool.
...xabi
This post needs more song lyrics as comments
"That must have been a hoot to read for any older teachers, given the expression's origin.

> The verbal phrase had been an African-American vernacular euphemism for ""sexual intercourse,"" used in popular dance music lyrics and song titles at least since the 1930s."
"""i'm sorry ms. jackson, oooooh, signed bruce springsteen for real. i never meant to be tardy but i apologize for fucking nothing."""
I thought you weren't supposed to say that anymore?
"Dear Bruce,

You are not The Boss of me.

Xabi has detention.

Yours truly, 

Ms. Jackson"
"I was almost born at a Bruce Springsteen concert. He’s good for something, yknow"
Nice. My little sister was conceived in the back of a van in the car park after a Bruce Springsteen concert in 1985 :)
That kid.....was Xabi Alonso.
">Please excuse him if he is **tardy.**

Lol, what an asshole. That's just rude why would he do that?"
Having to sit through 4 hours of Bruce was probably punishment enough.

"The teacher is having him transferred to a special needs school, because only retards like Bruce Springsteen."

You get Billy Joel and you might be able to get out of anything in lower NY as well.
No joke. Growing up in NJ I skipped school on more than one occasion to see the Boss. If I came in the next day wearing a concert T-shirt all was fine with my teachers.

Upvote for Reign of Kindo!
r/yesyesyesno
I just gave em a listen. That band is wild. Your friend’s dad is bummer.
Did not expect to see The Reign of Kindo on Reddit today! Pleasant surprise.
Don't get to see Reign of Kindo mentioned too often. Joseph Secchiaroli has an angelic voice.
They need to realease the cover of dreams they did. It’s extremely good.
Loved the Reign of Kindo. Such a great band.
That’s when you turn the phone off and take the ass chewing later
I just want to thank you for introducing me to The Reign of Kindo. I've been really looking for something new to listen to. They're right up my alley!
"The Reign of Kindo seem like a bunch of awesome dudes! I love their music, sorry to hear about it. At least it makes for a good story!"
Yoo that's awesome. Just getting into TRK and they have a great sound
Fuck that shit. I would’ve just stayed and dealt with dad later
"Good. Never heard of the band so assuming a small time pub rock noisy screamo band I too wouldnt be happy if the singer tried to do that.

Someone with some clout I may let them stay"
Decided to look up Reign of Kindo and in the first 3 seconds of the first song I clicked (just wait) I know this is gonna be great
"Reign of Kindo is a name I haven't heard in a while, I remember I used to listen to their EP on *repeat*. Time to catch up on their entire discography"
"For some reason I felt the need to create a subreddit just now

But also that sucks man"
"I want to beat the shit out of his not-cool dad

And since I'm being downvoted anyway, I'll beat up his dad's dad too. And his dad's dad's dad. Tf you guys gonna do?"
Wow that dad sounds like a cuuunt
Don’t know if i should upvote or downvote.
You're an asshole for doing that to your friend.
Of course she accepted the note. The kid got her Bruce Springsteen's autograph.
I’m glad Ms. Jackson did not keep the note.
With the kid being named Xabi I was thinking it was gonna be useless since it was written in English. Never would've guessed Xabi was a kid in the US

The interesting thing is he and his wife are friends with Tom Hanks and his wife.
No offence to Tom Hanks but Springsteen is in his own top tier category of being an utter legend.
The keyboard players have binders full of charts for quick reference.
"yeah, what're you gonna do, argue with him? he's the boss, man."

"So good! This was back with the original 5, right after they released Rhythm Chord and Melody. They’re incredible musicians. One of the best live bands I have ever seen."
Sometimes the headliner can take forever to get on stage.
"Speaking as a former kid with very controlling parents, sometimes they would randomly shorten my curfew by an hour or two, just to remind me they were in charge. They'd do the same if I made plans with friends - they'd wait until the day of, then tell me ""actually, you've already had a lot of time to yourself this week, stay home and do chores/study."""
And how did they make contact with the band? Jumping and yelling excitedly... like everyone else?
"When I was a young-un, I would go to shows only to see the opener and 1/3 of the main act because it was downtown and it was usually late. Its nice being an adult now though"
"I mean, even a few moments live is worth it when you are a teenager desperately in love with a band’s music. My mom went took me to shows when I was a teenager, and we’d get a song or two in from the headlining band and then dip because of school/work the next day, unless it was my favorite band. 

It was always better than not going at all, and my mom liked getting new CDs from her favorite supporting acts."
"Because the plan was to petition for a later curfew no matter what happened that night. 

He knew asking before hand would have been a ‘no’, no matter what. If you call and say the opener went long wahhhhh wahhhhh’ maybe Daddy will be tricked and let you stay out. Wouldn’t have worked with my parents. They are actually reasonable and would rather have had me be honest from the beginning. 

‘Mom, dad, I really want to go to this concert tonight but I won’t be home until 1am. I’ll have my homework done early, and I have a sober ride home.’ 

This kid’s plan was to have the person on stage call his dad and hope it worked out. Only reasonable explanation."
Upvote for upvoting Reign of Kindo!
"Same! 

If I'm really honest (I don't mean this in a dickish way), I didn't realise they had that many fans. I figured they had very minor success about 15 years ago and just disappeared.

Can't remember how I discovered em (I'm British) but their debut was brilliant."
There are so many songs they have done that I wish I had on an album. They had a Christmas EP a few years ago and I can’t find it anywhere now. It was so good

"Storytime:

So when I was a kid, my mum found some cheap Wimbledon tickets and quietly pulled us out of school to go see (one of?) the Williams sisters play. It was fucking awesome, by far one of my best memories; the crowd was restless and tipsy and somehow we even did a double mexican wave that disrupted the actual game for a bit.

Anyway, my mum told us not to tell anyone because we did it on a school day, so we were officially 'sick'. So we didn't, except that my mum then got chatting with the teacher the next morning and told us where we were. When class actually started, my teacher turned to me with a massive grin on her face and loudly asked me how my sick day at Wimbledon was. 

At the time I think I slightly hated her, because I felt like she was taking joy in my discomfort, but later I realised she was actually in support of it and was letting me know it was okay to tell everyone else how good it was.

Tl;dr - It was fucking awesome"
Either I dont get the joke you're making or you dont get the song
Honestly that was my first thought before I gave it more consideration. Haha.
"Yeah imagine your little shit doing something that makes you give him curfew. Then some asshat calls you up like ""HEY brah! Look, I know Hunter messed up but come on! It's Skyler, from The Reign of Kindo^oo^^oo ....hello..?"""
Yeah if it was fuckin Lynard Skynard then maybe he’d’ve lernt sumthin instead of that noveau prog jazz fusion modal sheeeeeit.
Rip
"Joined the navy, worked on helicopters, flew drones, got out and now works a cushy job at an Amazon data center making FAR more than I do. So yeah, he did alright, haha."
"Some consistency is good, but few kids forgive draconian discipline."
"Curfews are shitty and plain dangerous. Their friends aren’t gonna leave the concert before it ends, so it means your fucking kid will be going back home on his own. Alone. That’s way more dangerous than allowing some leeway so that your kid makes at least some of their way home surrounded with friends."
"IMO  it depends entirely dependent on the age of the kid at the concert if he was 19 and still living at home because he was in further schooling then let him figure out life a bit. If hes 14 and wants to stay out past 12 an hour away from home, if you can go with him. if you cant, make him stay home."
I’ll sit with you in the minority.
"Nah. Think about the grand scheme of things. Is this kid going to later remember that next morning of school, or his father allowing him to have an experience of life. School is important but overrated. Experience is what builds us and creates our future. Education is what civilization requires to attain that future. But both have to coexist."
"Ok, boomer."
"Holy shit. They're one of my all time favorites. So happy to see them getting love.

Funny story I had just moved to Brooklyn and was listening to Spotify. I was bored and took a look at Spotifys concerts page for the first time in years, not expecting much.  Only to see the Reign of Kindo were playing just a few miles from my apartment that night.  It was like something out of a movie, they're incredible live.  The easiest way to describe them is that they're all about the music, in the best way possible.  They're just...good."
"Man, I totally forgot about this band and album. I haven't listened to them since about 2011. I know I have Rhythm and Chord Melody and This Is What Happens somewhere, but I don't know where. I'll have to listen to them on Spotify on my way to work tomorrow."

"The fact they questioned Xabi to Xavier it seems the V-B was in question not the X which is the same in both.

In basque, catalan and valencian - X is either a 'sha' or a 'cha' sound. So Xabi  = Shaby and txapela = Chapela.

In spanish X is like in english. Despite this the name Xavier is pronounced hah-vi-er"

"Sometimes curfew isn’t about what you did, but about rules at home. When I was a teen, I had to be home by 1am or I was grounded. In this case, though, I would’ve said yes, he could stay. 

Curfews are dangerous to your kids! If your kid’s curfew is set in stone, earlier than their friend’s, it means your kid is coming back home on their own. Allowing that curfew to be flexible will mean your kid will be going back home with friends, and safety lies in numbers."
If my son wanted to stay to see the current Lynard Skynard I would make him come home too.

That kid knew going into the concert he had a curfew. It wasn’t suddenly imposed for no reason. That is reasonable parenting.
"Wow what draconian discipline! From this one story we can infer entire draconian parenting styles. A real terrible father, that one."
"Being home by midnight is draconian lmao

What the fuck?"
"I have the belief that you have a 50/50 shot with the gratuity/parental hate regardless of the fact that you put your heart and soul into raising a kid.
  
Ready for a long story?  About a father giving his kid 3k so he could overdose?  
   
I believe most of you can already create the story so there is probably no need for me to continue."
Til a curfew is draconian.
"> draconian discipline

Lmao Jesus Christ... gtfo"
So what? Kids should be allowed to stay out alone all hours of the night? Curfew is draconian now? The parent is accommodating enough to let his kids go to concerts. And I’m sure curfew is at the same time every night. The kid knew what he was getting into when he went to a late show.
"We really don't know enough to be making any judgements.

For all we know, the father received a call from his sons phone, where a strange man he doesn't know asked to let his teenaged son stay late at a concert, a typically adult environment where one could potentially be exposed to alcohol and/or drugs.

I absolutely agree with your point, but we have basically no context in this situation.  Only high school was mentioned, so for all we know the kid could've been 13 or 14.  No specifics regarding the venue were given, so for all we know it could've been somewhere known to get rowdy or where the flow of alcohol and/or drugs was freer than it should be.  It's also a dick move to ask retroactively for permission like this.  I never had a curfew, but my parents would've been pissed if I just didn't turn up home when I normally do on a school night and went incommunicado for a few hours before getting a stranger to call them on my phone.  There are a myriad of circumstances where the dad's reaction was perfectly reasonable."
"I think it depends on the kid tho.

Some kids are real shitheads that push boundaries constantly. In a bad way. 

Imagine a situation where he was already in trouble and the kid goes ""okay its my favorite band, can i go out until 10"". And dad goes ""okay but 10 on the dot or whatever"". Then at 10:15 the guys trying to get extra time by exploiting someone else.

Also, the dad probably thought it was fake at the time."
"Instilling good values, and being consistent in raising your child is what will create a good parent of said child. The child was allowed to go to a concert, have a good time, and be home at a certain time."

I sat on the phone with my friend as he struggled with the decision to leave everything he knew behind and go serve a purpose larger than himself. He left his friends, family, a good support system, and other great opportunities and went and faced something totally unknown. I talked with him about the moral and personal implications of being in the position of having to take a life, and what that means for his faith, which he takes very seriously. I saw him have to put his dreams on hold, give up romantic relationships he wanted to pursue, and do thankless, back breaking work in service to a country he cares about.

It takes people like him taking big, bold steps like that to ensure that you and everyone else can sit there on your computer and be so critical of the things you are ignorant of.

That poor kid is in high school, and has a ten p.m. curfew on the night of a special event.  What has this father’s level of strictness and intransigence taught his son, except “my dad is an asshole?”"
"I think your comment betrays a deeper problem with parenting in this country in general: people think ""put[ting] your heart and soul"" aka effort is enough to do a good job.  It's not, and the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  I've known so many parents who do so many things that are objectively problematic for their children, like spanking, but refuse to even consider their *opinion* on how they raise their children might not be correct.  The fact that you love your kids and try really hard doesn't make you a good parent, being self-reflective and self-critical in your actions, doing what's best for the child, and building a support system around your family does."
"Well, that’s the point, isn’t it? That kid isn’t alone. He’s with friends at a concert. Enforcing the curfew means that yes, now the kid will be going back home on his own, because there’s no way his friends are leaving the concert early."
">We really don't know enough to be making any judgements.

You can stop there. That is the majority of reddit assumptions haha."
"Damn, you're both right. We can't have that here, you have to fight to the death. 

If I were a parent I'd have trouble balancing both points; you can have both, but I guess the right amount of either depends on what a parent thinks is healthiest/happiest for their child."
"I just made the rule that if he wants to go to a concert and stay out late, that's fine, but he still has to get up and go to school. I call it ""being responsible for your irresponsibility.""

So why'd he take a job that has him killing civilians then? Killing a bunch of farmers, cabbies, and other low skilled labor folks who don't give a crap about us and just want to live their lives? Why ruin the lives of people who are no danger to us? You have any idea how many civilians are murdered by drones? It's not entire populations that want us dead. It sounds to me more like when you talked to him about how he feels about taking a life, given you just stated you believe entire populations around the world want us dead, it sounds like you talked about how he feels about killing people you already believe want to kill us. A ton of civilians and their kids were butchered by your friend, but you shrug it off because you believe some guy called Hassan, a simple cabby, his wife and kids all have it out for you, even though they're probably more concerned about where to get some more spending money for the family.

Yeah, there are some evil folks over there, but a ton of civilians have been butchered by your friend. The Iraq war? Saddam had not only stopped the creation of WMDs are per the requirement, he went OUT OF HIS WAY to prove he wasn't, and then we went to war with Iraq anyway and your friend helped kill a whole bunch of strangers who couldn't care less about you and just wanted to live their simple boring little lives.

> there are entire populations out there that want nothing more than to kill you simply because you live in the western world

Entire populations? What laughable nonsense. Your friend helped destroy the lives of a whole bunch of strangers who never wished us harm, and in fact many of whom looked up to our country as well. Fuck your friend."
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you
"haha, classic mango"
"Better to ask forgiveness than permission, may not be the most responsible thing to do but would I ever regret seeing my favorite band perform? Hell nah"
"This is exactly why, as a parent, I would make the curfew flexible for that one night. Then I would know where my kid is, and earn some loyalty at the same time. Curfews are necessary, but are only respected when the reason behind them is valid. By the time a kid is in his teens he should know that he'll be buggered the next day if he doesn't get enough sleep. Sending a kid home to sleep when his favourite band is playing live is pointless."
Do we know that the kid asked permission to go first?
"""hey son, your curfew is 11 pm""

""ok, but dad this concert lasts til 1"" 

""ok your concert is still 11 pm""

reasonable if you ask me"
Lol
"You're inferring A LOT based on very little about him. Also, curfews for children are pretty reasonable rules. This isn't the dad saying the kid can't go out ever. Its ""go out, but be home by this reasonable hour."""
"Letting your kid go to a concert and then refusing to let them see the whole show even after the band itself asks permission is called ""helicopter parenting."""
"It isn't about being a *good* parent, it's about becoming a *better* parent."
Well said
"Hah, yeah.  This entire comment thread is based off of 1 innocuous sentence."
"I mean, we also don't know the context of the kids behavior.

If this is a straight A student who's never tardy, has never lied and asked about this concert months in advance? Yeah the dad seems like an overbearing jerk.

If this is a kid that lies all the time, bugged his parents about letting him go to the concert since he told them a week ago, and is barely passing his classes then yeah the dad has a point."
"In my opinion, setting a curfew is a sign of mistrust. But setting an expectation of being in one place and then coming home is another. So the better way to go about this would’ve been to tell the child to come home after the show. The fact that the child called instead of just staying out and suffering consequences later is of strong character. That’s what builds forward. Adhering to a curfew does not a stronger character make."
"Yeah, I know right? People on reddit forget that people can have different opinions and that’s okay as long as there are reasons that support both."
Checks out. Black Ops 2 was definitely a good use of irresponsibility.
"I get your point and that’s how it works in the real world. In high school I was constantly tired and working despite sleep deprivation. As an adult I have literally never run into that problem. 

Adults get days off to do what they want to do as long as they can pay for their life style."
"Memes last minutes instead of weeks now.

Sad times we live in."
"No problem. They're incredible. And they let anyone in for free who records their shows, and they always sell the same night's recording of the show afterwards. They're technically a jam band live because they jam in and out of their songs, but it's progressive rock, not like hippy type jam band stuff. Their shows are like a giant party and they have buildups like EDM shows that explode into songs. They also play one or two covers of songs every show too. Legitimately a top 3 live show in the world.

Their albums are very composed and put together well. It's really only their live shows where they jam."
"Honestly I don't really listen to jam bands, only Umphrey's, and they're kind of an exception because they're mainly progressive rock more than they are a jam band. Their shows are amazing though. I saw them four straight years on 4/20 in Austin. Well the fourth year was 4/19 because they didn't play a show on 4/20 that year haha. They rocked so hard my boss's friend had a panic attack and I had to take him to the side to calm down while I kept dancing haha."
Parliament Funk was there
Dave's a mess
"And hear your sister's voice calling us home, across the open yards"
"Plus the school / college is ""Ex-ayvee-urr"" too"
"I typically hear the college Xavier pronounced with the hard X to start but as a name hear it almost always as more of a Z sound. Javier also has different emphasis on other syllables and an even softer opening constant like an H, as is typical in other Hispanic words."
"I only know the University and everyone pronounces that ""Zay-vyure"". Might just be a case of classic Midwest bastardization of foreign words though."
"Not everyone is taught in English in school, buddy."
I actually did to go school and I was the best that is why I don't knw the word because I was NEVER late EVER!!!

You don’t know the dad.  Maybe he’d have grounded the kid for a year.  Maybe he’d have beaten the shit out of him.  Maybe he’d have kicked him out of the house.
"Good point, the situation is different if the dad didn't know about the concert at all."
"Almost like how if someone murders someone, they're a murderer?

Inflexibility is anathema to healthy psychological development. And this is a pretty extreme example of it. But no, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt cause rules are important?

No ones saying forget the rules. But this is easily an obvious example of draconian adhering to rules for the sake of it."
"Erm... I'm not weighing in on if I think the dad is harsh or not, but it's definitely not helicopter parenting lol."
"I believe in all things that you judge a person for, parenting included or perhaps especially, you should judge a person based not on where they are, but where they're going.  Being a good parent, partner, or human being isn't a place to arrive, it's a mind set of doing a better job today than you did yesterday and a better job than that tomorrow.  

That is to say, I agree with you."
"Mmm, have to disagree.  Setting a curfew is a good general rule for when a kid should be home.  Lets the parent(s) know their kid is alright before going to sleep at night, don't have to constantly ask when they'll be home, etc.

That being said, that doesn't mean a curfew has to be a strict thing that can't be bent, it's just the general rule of thumb.  You can still let your kid stay out for special events, or if you know they're somewhere safe, or have supervision, etc.

It's also up to good parenting to know what age/maturity level to no longer have a curfew.

You can have a curfew and still have let the kid stay at the concert."

"Or maybe he'd be reasonable and just ground the kid for a short while or take away some privilege for a while and the kid believes rules should be followed.

Growing up, my parents were always pretty reasonable with punishments looking back, and while I'd ignore them on some things and deal with it, others I'd always listen. Which rule got which treatment was pretty arbitrary looking back."
"It's fine to give your kid a curfew. But maintaining that curfew in a situation where there is a 100% chance that it's going to embarrass your kid in public- that's bad parenting.

Accept that kids are kids and if you're really worried, then just don't let them go to the concert in the first place. The dad did more harm than good in this situation.

For reference, I'm 28 so I'm halfway between dad and kid."
"I agree with you, but I think a curfew goes well beyond the parent's peace of mind.  You give a child a curfew for *their* benefit, first and foremost.  Humans need structure and stability to thrive, and in my opinion, a curfew and/or bed time lays the foundation for that.  How much harder would it be for an adult to maintain a regular, responsible schedule if their parents never gave them one as kids, or if that schedule was bent/broken every time it conflicted with a desire?  If they are used to doing whatever they want when they were still developing, it will be a lot harder for them to be regular and responsible once the mold is set.  You don't get a second round of the formative years.  Whatever you learn or don't learn young, you will struggle to change when you are older.  That's not to say rules should never bend.  I agree with you that they should--if and where it will enhance the child's life or, at the very least, not hurt them.  The decision to do so should be approached with caution, to ensure it is an exception and not a breakdown of the rule, that the right lessons are being or have been learned, etc."

"Anymore closer, I would've seen the atoms inside"
This is it
I'd watch commercials like this and think the cgi was really good
Wasteful
"It's not the same clip. Ice and creamer misses, but isn't shown on the cup."
"If anyone wonders why, it’s cuz some states in the States forbid the use of CGI in commercials."
Why can’t all iced coffee be made this way?
That turbulent flow...
"I think its kind of funny that the machines are supposed to be shitty at their job. If it didnt carelessly spill stuff all over the place, it wouldnt be as aesthetically pleasing"
The coffee looks very American...
Wow
This looks sick! The creativity of some people is amazing!
Is Michael j fox the barista
"Funny how they speed it up so you miss all the spills, and slow it down conveniently for the parts where the liquid makes it into the cup.

A different edit of the same footage could make it look like they spilled all of it."
Love you from PM!!
Why am I here. I need to get my life
"That video reminds me of how the most influential avertisers and the companies that hire them generally leave nothing to chance.

https://thoughtmaybe.com/advertising-at-the-edge-of-the-apocalypse/"
Wow.  Thats usually cgi these days.   Plus i would think it would be easier to just hire some helpers.
"While I enjoy the mechanisms, this looks like a terrible, long-drawn out ad."
lol sickening
This looks kind of terrible to be honest. Super cool but it does not make me want an iced coffee it makes me want to clean up the mess.
"Back when I was a kid, commercials used elmers glue as milk in cereal, and vegetable oil sprayed out of a sprayer to show juiciness in a steak."
And that's why my food video on Insta only get like 100view...
It’s actually incredible how much over engineering goes into these adverts.  I was thinking this when reading about mountain bikers talking about geometry of a bike - it’s just unbelievable.
"Wow, that was amazing to watch."
Nice
"I used to go to meetings at Giralt's studio, but haven't been to one since he started his robot phase. He was really into Arduino at that point, so I can see how he took micro controller work to the next step."
"I bet more people have seen this video that the actual advertisement. 

The company that produced this advertisement missed a huge marketing opportunity by not including their logo in this behind-the-scenes video."
"At first I thought I was on r/shittyrobots due to all the spillage, but once you see the slow motion footages everything becomes clear."
Thought I was going to be watching an r/shittyrobots post here.
Looks like coke
Looks like a thai tea.
"It's amazing how much time, effort, and money gets put into things that are just ad-spam.  If this were my job, I would feel incredibly demoralized, knowing that I'm spending my life giving zero value-added and also nuisance to this world."
I’ll take one please
Kind of looks like a Clicker
"Is it just me or are the robots incredibly unnecessary, and you can get the same effect from a person with somewhat steady hands"
Hire a bartender.
Surely engineering something like this is as expensive as a good CGI sequence?
"The real genius is making you watch the commercial again, enthusiastically."
"duck it, I want one now"
"But shouldn't this called milk tea, instead of coffee?"
"This be like the 8th time i seen this. 


Nice"
Awesome
I didn’t read the title and thought this was a soda
"Did it really need all that to make that shot?
Seems excessive"
I have no idea why this is so funny to me
His IG is litty titties
"Pssh, my nephew can do that. He's been learning on this thing called adobe premiere. If he can do it, can't you do a professional job for half the price? /S

Edit: added /s.... Tbh this really cool. Can't figure out how it's stabilized throughout."
Ewww iced coffee with milk
What kind of heathen puts water in iced coffee?
That piss-colored swill is supposed to be coffee?
"You know you joke but this got me to thinking, robots technically don't do anything, it's all the work of the person who coded the robot. And I know, ""but tiny tree, what about autonomous self learning robots?"", Yeah good question.

In the future I wonder if the person most responsible for the actions of a robot will be held accountable by law for their crimes. It's gonna be a wild ride."
"My question here is: wasnt cheaper to have 3 ppl throwing respectively ice, coffee and shit instead of that complicated robot machine?"
They took our jobs!!
They took our jobs!
Yeah looks like a little dinky cobot. They ain't of much more use than what you see here. I'd love to get one at the home to mess around with.
"It definitely seems too red! If the title didn't say coffee, I'd have assumed it was tea"
Might not be anything close to coffee. They use motor oil in pancake commercials for the syrup so you never know what’s going to make a good shot.
Most people dont have backlighting on their coffee.
"That's most likely because of the lighting illuminating the coffee from the sides/behind. It seems to be an uncorrected clip, post production would fix that."
It seems like a lighter roast with more ice than empty space.
Looks orangish to me
Redditsh*
Looks like Vietnamese Coffee
I figure it’s for aesthetic reasons
Thought this was a coke commercial at first.
Are you saying they used HUMAN BLOOD??
"It can actually look like this when lit really well, my guess is it’s real cold brew.
Source: am a barista"
"Some times my home made cold brew will come out a light brownish red like that. Just kinda depends on the beans I guess. 

I’m more amazed at how thought out the lighting and lens filters are because you can see every damn air bubble in the cup and it feels amazing to watch it."
I would say that is due to all the very bright lights shone at it.
It's probably dyed water.
That’s what color it is when spread out and the light hits it just right
"Could be something else, I heard in HS from a teacher they use diff items in advertisements to make things look better. Like they used glue instead of milk for cereal or nail polish on burgers buns to make it shine"
I’m assuming this is an American commercial. American coffee is basically water so that could be the reason.
Why is this being debated like the dress? It’s clearly Coca Cola
I am pretty sure that this is actually a commercial for Thai tea. The colour is really similar and they add a large portion of half & half to the drink. It wouldn't make much sense to add that much cream to coffee either.
Because it probably is.
Found the southerner
Dude their Instagram is pretty great!!
"probably on purpose to get more nuance on the colours to be ""corrected"" or played with later in post."
It seems like it must be a lot
Ad agencies go to people who do this stuff on a regular basis and negotiate the cost of the effect.  probably costs around $5000 for a finished film clip.
"Damn, this sounds too good to be true. Source?"
please someone tell me this isnt true
And cows don’t look like cows on film. You gotta use horses.
absolutely
yeah and now i really want a thai tea. seriously when i go to thailand i order it pretty much every where i go.
You pass butter
"You should really do more research on these camera systems before talking out of your ass. The same system is also used in medical surgeries 


https://www.mrmoco.com/about-us/"
I heard that cow milk doesn't film well so they actually use rat ejaculate.
Way too much rat ejaculate
way too much milk!
Nah it’s the perfect amount.
If you ask me any amount of milk in coffee is way too much. So when I saw this I cringed a little. Never ask me to make you coffee if you like light and sweet. Cause I put a drop of milk and one scoop of sugar in and feel like I need to dump it out and start over because I just ruined it.
"Yep, I was shocked when I found out that McDonald's actually uses their real ingredients and practical photography for their menus and commercials. 

Their food could really look like the pictures if you let them spend 30+ mins making it and only look at it from one side."
Check his instagram and you’ll get the answers you seek. Or check the stickied comment by the mod.
Clearly the cost of coffee and milk is just too high to do the 7 takes it would take get the exact same shot with 5 unpaid interns.
Rats beat you to the punch.
I wouldnt be surprised. I read somewhere that they actually used rat ejaculate for the milk.
Pretty heavy laws against that in food commercials
"A lot of people, apparently."
There’s alot of odd laws in the US about CGI and 3D Animations in food commercials. You gotta keep it real to some degree
"For whatever it cost to make that robot, I would have gladly stood on a ladder and thrown ice and coffee into a cup . Not sure anyone thought of that. Who’s the genius now ?"
"Strikes me as the kind of fake, overly elaborate self-promotional shot you set up and show off to try to attract more clients."
"Because it seems an OBSCENELY overengineered way to pour ice, coffee and milk into a glass"
Why?!
"Very illegal. IIRC it's ""misleading"". Which doesn't make sense to me because commercials barely use real food anyways."
I love this law!
The only thing that has to be real is the actual food product being sold in the ad. Everything else can be fake to any extent.
The first legal definition of AI will come from someone trying to get out of being legally responsible for their robot's crimes.
"That’s one of the major barriers to AI incorporation into our economy. The field of explainable AI is in its infancy, and right now if an AI makes a bad decision there is no way to explain it and build one that wouldn’t make that decision. You have to start from scratch every time."
"I honestly thought it was cola for a moment there. (Not impossible, given some of the clever tricks needed to make food/drink look good for stuff like this.)"
It looks like Thai iced tea!
ThaiTea
really?
And they use Cetaphil for...nevermind
"I’m pretty sure that’s not allowed. The syrup one is okay because the syrup is not the main product, but with this coffee one they would have to use the actual product."
No way. This is much more watery. Vietnamese coffee is rocket fuel + condensed milk.
"You put cream in sweet tea???

Edit: the filmmaker said on his Instagram that it’s iced coffee."
Y'all
I can’t help but wonder if they could have achieved the same effect with three people tossing ice cubes and pouring coffee and milk off camera.
Add a zero
To good to be true? What sounds good about having to jack off 118 rats
"Look at it, it’s clearly rat ejaculate"
"Obviously not true, but still half true. I’ve heard about using glue, or anything that’s white and thicker than milk or pours slow-mo-er-y than milk."
Sorry friend. It *is* true.
"I haven’t tried it in Thailand, I wonder how the taste differences"
Oh my God...
This *exact* system shown in the commercial isn't used for medical purposes. It's used to make a somewhat unimpressive coffee commercial
Who hurt you
Can confirm I also heard this
"Rat milking is a very prestigious calling. I hear competition is fierce to get the milking license, yet only scant few are issued every year. This is only hearsay though--the rat milking society is very secretive."
You're probably not going to be as precise as a robot finely tuned to make that shot happen.
Ya but they can use the same robotic parts over and over again.. and reprogram them as needed on the fly.. then shoot tons of different commercials with them and profit. Necessary? Probably not.. but it’s also probably pretty useful.
"I’m mostly joking but something about this made me uncomfortable idk.  Like, it’s so perfectly done?"
"Not even barely. They use glue, motor oil, and assorted inedible items."
"I'm mean, ""legal"" is binary, yeah? I don't think there are gradations of legality. Punishment, sure; but not legality."
No one thought it was blood and cum? Okay just me
I thought it was Coca Cola as well!
"Yup, it won't soak in as easy as syrup so they have longer to film. Also it looks ""more"" like syrup than actual syrup."
"It should be clarified that the thing they're advertising has to be the real thing, legally, in the US. It's things that they aren't advertising that are supplemented or add ons to the things they're advertising that they can use motor oil and what have you for.

Like if they're advertising pie, the pie has to be real, but the whipped cream on top doesn't have to be."
[Yes](https://imgur.com/a/itiYZCl)
"And Elmer's glue in cereal ones. 

Honestly there are tonnnnns of them you wouldn't expect"
"That sounds awesome! Now, can I *only* get it in Vietnam?"
"I think he meant that they would use tea because it looks ""better"". Ads are most of the times not reality."
"i do, to make a ghetto thai iced tea."
Yeah the outcome (to me) is underwhelming compared to what effort went into making it
"Well, do you have someone who can grip the glass tightly, perfectly move the glass within a very tight frame around for the perfect shot while being capable of repeating the same experiment dozens of times so you can cherry-pick the results?

The answer is no. Machines or CG have been responsible for these glamorous shots for a long time now because no human can control these things reliably. Just remember: the beginning scene in this gif is slowed down already."
"It's more about repeatability and being able to finely adjust parameters. You can run it many times for the perfect shit. There will be a random element in how the liquids fall, but even that's fairly consistent on a gross scale."
"Not sure you realize how precise and consistent these ads strive to be. The second pour was to fill to the rim of the slanted glass without pouring over, and then another 1/4 or 1/3 of the glass full enough to not spill over, mix well (so poured against the glass), all within a specific time after the first pour to match the tilt of the glass and zoom of the camera. Also, all of the spillage had to be out of frame. Very hard to accomplish all day with a couple people trying to consistently and accurately pour liquid into a glass. Of course it took many tries to get it right enough with the robots. But at least the robots are consistent and can be adjusted slightly and at the end of the day, might cost less than having 2-3 people just pouring liquid into a glass for a few days (which would probably be the guys who are already running the robots, cameras, set and cleanup haha)."
Could be.
Maybe its a [rat king](https://www.google.se/search?q=rat+king&client=safari&hl=sv-se&prmd=ivsn&sxsrf=ACYBGNSWwVfwYcsVB8qqWr4dH00-oJc8AQ:1574741285567&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjcv8G3gIfmAhXxl4sKHdO1Ch0Q_AUoAXoECA8QAQ&biw=375&bih=635&dpr=3) so they only have to spank one rats meat?

"You are right, downvotes are salty people who are easily fascinated by what we live in, which is  r/aboringdystopia"

IIRC they use white paint for milk in cereal commercials.
"Yes, thank you; the Big Mac you see is till exactly the same Big Mac but everything has been meticulously placed (down to the sesame seeds), and often only towards the outside so it looks fuller, plus they’ll melt the cheese with a little blowtorch too so it looks just perfect, as opposed to the one we get that’s been slapped together and thrown in a now-humid box."
"What about cars?  The commercials are almost purely CGI and the cars they use to film are a special car, not the make/mode they are selling."
I’m gonna need a side-by-side of actual syrup and motor oil. I keep maple syrup in the fridge and it pours nice and thick. Not sure why they couldn’t just use cold syrup?
"Well, as long as the one that reaches my plate is real."
No way. Any Vietnamese restaurant definitely has it. Thai coffee is close to the same and a little more available.
Lee’s Sandwich is great for over priced Viet food
Not much went into making it though. You have to just set the specific parameters and then do it over and over again. That's it. Now imagine some dude replicating the same quick motion again and again... you see what is more effort here?
"You’ve missed something big here. The value of that robotic system is that it allows repeatability. You can quickly reset that system: top off coffee and milk, reload ice machine and wipe out cup. Boom, shoot it again. Repeat that process until you see a take where the liquid swirls in the perfect way and the bubbles just crest the lip of the glass without dribbling down the side."

Oh it was glue you're right. I just remember it was something you definitely don't want to ever eat lol
Oh it was cum you're right. I just remember it was something you definitely don't want to ever eat lol
"Well the food they're advertising has to be the actual ingredients that you get in the store. But you can also have other things in there and it doesn't have to be prepared for eating. So the Big Mac is undercooked so the patty doesn't shrink, while the cheese and bun are real, they're photoshopped to perfection, and the whole think is full of metal pins holding everything in place. The product you buy in the store may not look the same, but it's made of the same ingredients.

>That’s why they can use Elmer’s glue for the milk in cereal. You CAN eat it, it just isn’t a food.

No, because then they couldn't use motor oil for pancake syrup. The reason they can use Elmer's glue is because they sell cereal, not milk. If they sold milk, they'd have to use real milk."
"Well the other guy said only what's being advertised has to be real, so if advertising cereal, the milk can be fake. I've definitely seen some things they use that is not at all edible... Not without serious health complications at least."

A friend from Ireland came to me the other day to chat. He said he wanted a sleeping pill and sent me a picture of that medicine. He asked me how much the medicine was and wanted me to buy it for him. Actually, I really don't know what he's talking about. I have been trying to explain to him,but He insisted I know, he also said the price is negotiable. In the end, he said angrily to me: ""this medicine is made in India. How can you not know because you are Indian? why don't you want to help me?""  
I wish I could help him, but the thing is I'm not Indian......... When I told him I wasn't Indian, we all laughed."

"Yeah, except not... meds aren’t what the kid would be associating with good taste at all because the kid thinks they’re just getting slightly gross Kool Aid. Meds are what the dad is tricking the kid into taking without knowledge of meds being involved, therefor no association with meds is taking place."
"Ngl, I used to fake headaches to get some of that sweet, sweet grape flavored Tylenol."
You should never have medicine at a childs arm reach anyway...
OD on ibuprofen lmao
I was dumbfounded when I got older and realized blue curacao tastes exactly like orange children's Triaminic (caveat: the last time I had orange Triaminic was like 1994 so it might taste different now). Neither have any business being that tasty.
You should hide medicine from your kid anyway.
Yeah this is definitely a r/DiWHY for me
Why did they make grape dimetapp so tasty then?
I'm old and I still suck the candy off of those coated aspirins before swallowing them.
"Why would your children have access to ibuprofen in the first place? I ought to call CPS on you, that is just disturbing. To every other parent and potential parent out there, this guy is a jackass. Always make sure your kids can't get anywhere near medicine. Man, I'd be a wreck if I had kids."
Tricking you into watching a video 5 times looking for some deception but it’s just a video of a kid drinking some juice would still be Deception +100
"Re as in redo means again, flex is something you do to display dominance. Op was flexing one the baby repeatedly and the baby was falling for it every time."
Do all 7500 people who upvoted this know what a reflex is?
also does OP know what a dad is? the original video had the audio of the mother
"We don't have a popular sub called ""dadsbeingsmart"", plus I bet they was basically a reflex. I bet money dad was struggling with this and the idea struck him like a reflex later on. I'll allow it"
OP is also meme dyslexic and is incorrectly using the skyrim meme which is weird considering op is a massive karma whore with 1 million post karma
"Last time I gave my toddler medicine I asked her to show me how she catches rain. Head back, mouth open tongue out, quick shot of medicine (using the syringe) to the back of the throat. It was over before she knew what happened."
Ours too. She'd get so mad and distressed that she would puke it all up. Now we just mix it in with some grape juice and she happily drinks it down!
You can usually have the pharmacist make you a different flavor. We went from waterboarding one of the antibiotics to taking the medicine by himself by changing it to grape flavor.
With my kid I say drink this and he says okay and that's it.  Ever since he was a toddler.
"Came here to comment this, but knew deep down someone else had beat me to it."

"This is why r/funny, isn't"
I'm not sure this kid is old enough for that discussion.
"I normally feel the same way but I have a 4 year old that absolutely will not take meds, no matter what kind of incentives I use. So a juice box with medicine inside is ok by me if that’s what has to happen"
"I'm aspiring to be a parent soon.  How do you plan to handle the whole Santa thing?  That's something I'm torn on.  I want to always be honest with my kid, but Santa..."
Lmao this is a baby. You waste your time talking to a baby if that’s your thing.
"Yeah two year olds totally understand concepts like ""sick"" and ""this medicine will make you better"" and ""the english language"""
"I was the same way. Now I have a 6 year old, and can't count all the lies (which I call manipulations). Honestly, sometimes you just have to. I'm not gonna  ruin his childhood because he thinks Pokemon are real. All you really can do, is minimize the amount of lies. I'm not saying you need to lie all the time. But honestly, you are setting yourself for a difficult parenthood if you can't lie and sneak some veggies into his diet because you want to be honest all the time. Mine loved veggies until about 6 months ago. So I am constantly having to lie about what they are and sneak them into his food. That alone is worth it. They won't suffer any damage when they get older.. or I would be fucked up with all the lies my parents told me. As my motto in life.. sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do."
"I don’t think anyone intends for parent=lying.

When kids are small you can’t explain these things to them, and I think it just becomes a habit fir the parent."
"Yeah, I'm definitely in the same boat, to an extent. I do not lie to my kids, until it's necessary. I will do what is needed to get my kid their medication, and for all we know this dad tried everything already. Just today I had to give my kid medicine. I didn't lie about it, but eventually I had to trick her into taking it. Sometimes there is no right option, there's only the least bad option. If I had to choose between letting her go without, holding her down, or tricking her, I went with the one that would cause her the least amount of harm."
I worked in a nursing home and this old lady did not take her meds unless you told her it was a shot of alcohol and then she was happy to take it and would even smack her lips after. I should add it was a psych ward too.
Yikes?
"Fucking thank you.

Skyrim memes need to die, especially if you don’t even know the skill names

Plus this post doesn’t belong on this subreddit."
"Lmao, that sounds hilarious. I wonder how kids react to it."
It doesn’t?
"Yeah, our young kids get water and milk. It’s cheaper and healthier than giving them kool aid and Capri suns. When sick they get pedalite and since it’s like candy for them they keep hydrated better."
Stop spamming.
Surely she's done more than tricks as a child to earn that view of her.
That kid looks sick which is why he’s probably looking like a hot mess. Lol
"Kids aren't uniform. Have another one, you'll see ;)"
Yeah this doesn’t belong here
All of us thought it. Everyone else was just too ashamed to admit it.
Moms got some manly ass hands
"Because it tastes pleasant, especially to kids, and therefore they enjoy it. Did you really need that explained to you?"
Ok boomer.
Good for you. Most people don’t.
"CVS has children's flavored medicine. Robotrippin on that bubble gun flavor, son."
Dimetapp cold medicine my dude. It tastes like a super concentrated Grape Crush Soda.

I've always loved that artificial grape flavored dimetapp

The reason my brother got his stomach pumped as a child."
"Whaaat??? That’s awesome, I had no idea!!

Now if only they made pool chemicals in the same size (I had to run my 3 year-old boy to the ER after he made it through a double-locked door in four minutes flat to the porch to eat some delicious bleach powder)"
I ate a whole bottle of vitamins when I was 3 and overdosed on iron. Had to get my stomach pumped. My parents said 30 mins later and I would've been dead.
"Oh no, the spiders!"
"Child proof containers are only a hindrance to adults. Children can open them just fine if only because of the limited thinking that getting the cap off is the only way to get the container open. Here are some novel alternatives: 


- melting in microwave or oven (did both, microwave is faster, but results in more parental anger).
- Jumping on it from top of stairs. Note: Put heavy book on top, otherwise sprained ankle.
- Dog.
- Smashing it in the car door.
- Smashing it in the bathroom door (note: door also died). 



... other attempts were made as well with varying levels of stupidity, including trying to use scissors, butter knives, bed frame feet, gluing nuts to it and giving it to the bird, putting it inside a hotdog bun and feeding it to the dog (it ate the bun, the pill bottle was ignored). 


Never underestimate the power of a bored and imaginative child."
"Yeah, unless both the parents are navy nuclear mechanics and so the kids smart as fuck, and can figure that shit out by age 4 -_-"
"If you ever have a child you'll learn that they possess unnatural abilities and a desire to rapidly end their lives.

As a 4 year old I managed to unlock a window, press the safety catch while pushing it open (weirdly this is something I struggle to do as an adult), and then dive out. All in the time it took my dad to go to the toilet for a pee."
True but I'd be mad after.
I will do it
"Yeah like happenstance. Happen as in The Happening with Mark Wahlberg, stance means the way you stand. Mark Wahlberg happenstanced the shit out of The Happening when that one person put their head in the lawn mower and Mark Wahlberg just stood there and watched."

Yes

So, we have one guy not knowing what a reflex is. But what about OP?"
"This is the first i have heard of ""changing the flavor"" in my 28 years of life. If I ever have kids I will always remember this comment. Thank you for this contribution."
ok
I just adore that you're being downvoted for being a competent parent who knows how to raise a disciplined and well behaved child. It's so representative of the attitude of parents who use Reddit.
"Most of them have gone down hill already lol... Subs don't care to differentiate between satire and material that fits the sub anymore. They care about upvotes, and my one orange arrow can't change that.

E: Or in this case don't fit the sub at all."

"I've been here too long, Reddit has already gone down hill over the years. No amount of upvotes can bring it back friend, I'm sorry."
Medicine for kids is way better now. Except for the cherry shit.
"> I normally feel the same way but I have a 4 year old that absolutely will not take meds, no matter what kind of incentives I use

Do some meds suppository style and they will start swallowing them real quick."
"How long did it take you to realize Santa was not real? If it was a normal duration like most people, meaning not long at all, then it did not make you lose trust in humanity or what not. I say let them enjoy the santa thing while it lasts."
"I wasn't told that Santa was real growing up and I don't feel like it diminished the magic of the holiday in any way. I know that a lot of people strongly disagree with that and get really defensive about the Santa myth, but it isn't necessary to believe in it to enjoy it. We still had the Santa movies, the Santa imagery, the stories, the songs, the lights, the tree, the presents, etc.. It was all the usual Christmas traditions; I just also knew that the gifts were from my parents. It was still a very exciting holiday (and still is).

The choice is up to you but I think either option is okay."
"My husband was scared to admit he learned santa wasn't real because he didn't want to stop getting presents. It made for a stressful holiday season wondering if he'd get presents and also pretending/lying to his parents.

I don't even remember ever believing in Santa because I had 3 older siblings who had likely already ruined it, but I don't feel like I missed out on anything. 

My aunt believed forever and was devastated when she found out Santa (among all the holiday characters) weren't real.

I feel the risks of something negative happening by having Santa is far greater than not having Santa. You could make the holiday magical in so many different ways, I don't think there's really a need to lie about Santa to make it magical."
"My son is 1.5 and understands when I say ""sit on the potty or put on a diaper"" which isn't so different than ""take this medicine or get sick"". He also understands ""bonk"" means he got hurt so its not outrageous to think he'd understand ""sick"" means he doesn't feel good. My neice is the same age and is actually a lot more developed in terms of speech and comprehension. It wouldn't surprise me to find a 2yo that would understand that."
Why did he stop liking vegetables? Did he watch one of those cartoons that demonises them?
I see you've met my mom
Well yes but this was probably where this started
No judgement.
I was giving praise. What do you think I was meaning.
Love me some of them bubble guns
"That was me as a kid with original formula dimetapp. Then they had to go and change it, so now it sucks."
My doctor always described my medicine as tasting like my favorite color power ranger when I asked so I guess technology has come a long way.
The thought of how many doses of children’s liquid DXM to get high nauseates me.
mmmmm children flavor
"Yep. But light, not heavy. So dank"
They're referencing how diphenhydramine gives you (scary) hallucinations at high enough doses because it starts to act as a deliriant in case nobody gets the reference. Not what I'd call a recreational drug unless you're really weird or desperate imo.
"Pills with garlic extract. It's supposed to be good for your immune system, but I bet eating too many of them at once would result in an upset stomach."
"Are you ok?

I mean, really, what drove you as a kid to break into medicine bottles so persistently?"
How were you old enough to do all of that but unable to just open the child proof lid?
"I have neices and nephews and they have never done anything like this. You're obviously trolling and or lying though, because you couldn't jump out a window because they have screens. Nice try ;)"
I will take the ring to mordor
"Have you ever been struggling with a problem then a bit later your just sitting on the couch or whatever and the answer hits you? like a ""I should hade a v8"" moment. It feels like a delayed reflex. The point is, it's debatable and clever and funny so I think it's fine in this sub"
So you always vote for random shit because your vote can't possibly make a difference considering the amount of people voting? Be the change you want to see.
"> They care about upvotes, and my one orange arrow can't change that.

My vote doesn’t count anyway, so I’m just gonna sit this one out.  Might be time to rethink that."
Omg thank you! I have an aversion for anything cherry flavored even now in my 30s thanks to all the medication they tried masking with shitty cherry flavor. Real cherries are okay but red starbursts go straight in the trash.
This fucks up the child.
"It never made me lose my trust in anyone, even though my mother had to tell me when I was like six. It just made me cry for a day, which I barely remember. Meanwhile, I definitely remember the magical moments of presents appearing out of nowhere at the doorstep at midnight of new year's Eve. I still don't know how. Probably a neighbour helping out."
"I’m an adult male who is doctor writes me for bubble gum flavored antibiotics, It’s so hard not to chug the bottle, because I’m unable to swallow those horse size antibiotics pills"
Dude I loved dimetapp too I'd sneak in the kitchen and steal gulps because it tasted so good
That has a lot different connotation as an adult...
"Yeah. It doesn't taste like they ground up a scream and added powdered dog shit now. Science, yeah bitch!"
you're the real MVP for letting me get the joke
"No joke, you start hallucinating"
the child’s name....
You think every window has screens? That says more about where you live than anything else.
"r/kidsarefuckingstupid



You have neices and nephews. Not your own children. And most often the horror stories or mistakes/accidents aren't shared even in family settings because of people like you who threatened CPS over kids just being dumb, explorative and often times too intuitave for their own good."
Welcome to Reddit where most the shit is made up and the points don't matter.
You guys are taking Reddit a little too seriously
Tf ? You ok ?
Redditors think literally everything fucks up the child.
"You’ve gotta get that under control. Like go get some actual bubble gum. You are an adult human, who can just go do that if you want."
Is mhim a thing or did your handwriting come out in your typing?
"I, as an adult male, used to take children's liquid ibuprofen when I felt a migraine coming on as that stuff acts way faster. They have since come out with liquid gels, but part of me misses taking 3tbsp shots of that weirdly gritty yet viscous orange flavored goo."
"The CSO of our company told me a story of how they tried at one business to make good tasting sleep medicine, little candies you could take with you on trips and just eat a couple to fall asleep.

Said the legal team wouldn’t allow it. Way too much litigious possibility when little Timmy OD’s on Benadryl cuz he got into the stash"
Same.  Under my dads sink.
"let's be honest, we all immediately thought of the pink ranger"
"Yeah I've heard it's a little similar to potential reactions to Ambien. Out of nowhere I had sleep paralysis + semi-lucid sleepwalking and persisting visual and audio hallucinations for a couple days after taking Ambien. Seeing shadow people and hearing voices and shit. Spooked me good, haha."
They’re a low effort troll
"I get what you’re saying, and sometimes feel like some old timer talking about Reddit back in the day, but it’s irritating to see garbage comments cluttering the place.   Even still, I downvote what I consider trash, and hope there are others doing the same.

Answer: Taiwan.
TIL: People in Hong Kong understand grammar better than 75% of my Facebook feed.
"Glad they used the right ""who's"""
"Well, Hong Kong is a fairly unique situation that doesn’t apply to everywhere else. Their status has existed at the allowance of China for 20 years despite them clearly being owned by China. It doesn’t extend well to, say, Taiwan, which China would have to fight a bloody invasion war to get."
"Just as a side note, I find it fascinating I see better English from people in Hong Kong than your average American"
"I think a lot of people seem to think Hong Kong is some independent nation that's 'been invaded' or something, Hong Kong has been officially part of China for the last 20 years they just have a unique political status that is due to end in 2047. So although it's not a great situation, it is still basically an internal Chinese civil disturbance/protest so it's not like the West can 'come to the aid' of Hong Kong militarily even if they really wanted to as that'd be illegally invading sovereign Chinese soil and more than likely starting WWIII in the process.

I'm not really sure what Hong Kong protestors 'end game' plan is because lets say even if the Western nations did all the sanctions and stuff the Hong Konger protesters want, in 27 years China is gonna be waltzing in anyway so I can understand if they want to try delay it as much as they possibly can but what is their actual end goal, what do they expect is going to happen exactly?"
"In the words of jroc from trailer park boys: ""it could happen to you, cuz it happened to me"""
Why would China attack  World Health Organization?
I appreciate the proper grammar.
"People genuinely have no idea how this shit works. 

If Hong Kong loses then chances are nobody that can read this (English countries) are even close to being “next” 

It’s also not like they’re invading Japan or some foreign country, They’ve got actual claims and political/economic investments in Hong Kong. Nobody is “next” it’s fear mongering at it’s best. Getting all the English speakers scared that they’re somehow a target of china. When they’ll quite literally be last on the list."
It's so clear! Taiwan is next..... It would be so sad. I live in Taiwan for almost 20 years and I love the life here. But I am not going to live in a communist country!   Taiwan doesn't need China. It's a wonderful country.
Not The USA
It’s far more complex than China dominates Hong Kong moves on to next target
again...what is the end goal of these post on reddit? seriously what the fuck do they expect americans or other countries to do?
"I mean, we already forgot about Tibet, so i guess it doesnt really matter who's next"
Probably not the country armed to the teeth.

"Australia.
As I say this now the Chinese government owns multiple airstrips in Western Australia. If the Chinese wished to seize control of the Kimberly region of Western Australia and land troops on our noble shores, there will, I emphasis this, *will* have air support.
Along with this the Chinese are buying more and more of our business. This is stagnating the economy so much that within at least 1 decade our economy may be worse than Greece. Already the Solomon Islands and Kiribati have declared allegiance with China. We Australians have never invaded anyone aggressively or for our own gain, we fought in the First and Second World Wars, we aided the South Koreans in the Korean War, we stood shoulder to shoulder with the US and South Vietnamese in the blasted jungles of of South East Asia. Australians have fought for one thing and one thing alone. Peace. Peace and freedom. So everyone be aware that China’s rise to superpower status is dangerous for the Western societies of the Pacific so we must stand strong, shoulder to shoulder, as we have always done. Remember that everything we do is in the name of peace and freedom.

"I’m working on a pet theory that 1989 is really the genesis of the rise of the new authoritarianism. Tiananmen, fall of the ussr (and subsequent KGB/oligopoly), Reaganism and now-Cons take over in the US. There are other key data points as well, but the realization I keep coming back to is that there is no back up, no good guys, no savior. Western Liberal Democracy thought it won the Cold War, yet this was just the beginning of the end for the world as it was known following WW2/Korea."

Taiwan.
Australia.  They have basically bought us already.
I mean yeah we all hate the Chinese government but this situation with HK is unique to HK.  China's buying people and land up in the islands near Papua New Guinea and has been using the western power playbook supporting separatists movements to position themselves in that area of the globe.
No one. A nation ruling over it's own regions does not diminish other nations.

Mongolia we already have Chinese people coming in and corrupt politicians trying to open the borders
I guess Wu's next
probably indonesia. but there will be almost no resistance tho. only a few will resist
good job

Definitely Taiwan.
Well Taiwan...
Australia.....but then again our government is corrupted anyways so would consider that as a lost
I wonder if the China Cables (inhumanity and concentration camps in the Uighur region) are a thing of interest in Hong Kong.
Pretty sure its Taiwan. Gonna take those odds at about 14 to 1.

It's a very real danger in the long run, and we, too focused on short term projects caused by electoral cycles, do not see the greater picture.

"As a Taiwanese person, I can tell you that China would overtake Taiwan in a matter of hours, just look at the proximity of where Taiwan sits. A few sanctions on China isn't going to do anything, just look at Russia / Crimea.

It's more about maintaining the status quo, keeping active dialogue, avoiding conflict and keeping relations stable. Any sort of armed conflict across the straight is a loss-loss situation for Taiwan."
"Hong Kong was born out of the west forcing itself in to China. It was a no name fishing village for most of it's history, but the British wanted tea, and they sold opium to buy it. Chinese wanted them to stop selling opium. British went to war to force them to continue to buy their opium, and they took Hong Kong as a colony to make sure they can always trade with China. Not a great start. Then Britain finally gives Hong Kong back, but they agree to make it a gradual reintegration over 50 years. China never fought to take Hong Kong. It was always part of China until western colonialism took it from them. I point that out only to contrast that with Taiwan, which was part of China but broke off after a civil war, making it an official independent state with no links to China, but China has a strong interest in taking it back.

This is not to say China is right in Hong Kong. The real issue has more to do with underlying problems with China itself. There is no surprise the protests are happening now. The protesters are overwhelmingly young. These are people who have only known an independent Hong Kong. Older generations are generally much more sympathetic with China because they have more of a connection to the country. However, it is much more difficult for a citizen of Hong Kong who has known freedoms that Chinese citizens don't enjoy to face the gradual transition back to China. Hence we see huge protests of largely young Hong Kong citizens. China is a deeply flawed country, sure, but the situation is far more nuanced than people have been describing it."
This is a good level headed take on it.  Things will basically go back to the status quo before the unrest.  It's not like they're on a war path.
"This is the exact fucking same comment as /u/Lunarhiatus

So you are saying there is a list?
"They've already started with the others a long time ago. Recently a defected Chinese spy spilled the beans on the politicians in Australia affiliated with China, and how they operate with impunity there"
Then why are they planting spies disguising as foreign students and politicians to manipulate canada and australia? Building ports in greece?
Give one an inch and they'll take a mile.
Yeah because USA is doing all the imperialism in the globe
They're already pretty fucked
I think they mean when a government succeeds in oppressing its people which government is the next to do it.
They expect us to realize if it can happen there it can happen anywhere and that once a government starts labeling protestors as terrorists it escalates pretty quickly.

It’s probably meant to be photographed and end up on sites like this where there response to it is good.
"Well, there's the fact that English IS a second language in HK (though admittedly not that many are fluent), but also because a lot of the graffiti you see posted is targeted at a foreign audience. I mean, take this one, for example. This one was aimed at the rest of the world, obviously, so English would naturally be the go to language.

Also, I'm sure there is an abundance of Chinese grafitti, just that you don't see as much of it posted to Western media sites/Reddit since, well, you're not expected to be able to read it."
All the graffiti that passes the filters to your feed that is. There are many selective pressures
"Could it be because English is an official language in Hong Kong, or the fact that English is the most commonly spoken language outside of mainland China? Why do all pilots speak English? If you were trying to get you message out to the world, what language would you choose? Xhosa? Farsi? I sure as shit wouldn't rely on most Mandarin speakers to be sympathetic to my message of liberty lmao"
"Well, they're not trying to talk to themselves. The paint was sprayed to be photographed to go onto the internet and put the fear into you."

"This is the most concise way of explaining the situation I’ve read so far and really points out why China will never let up. I’ve said in a comment ages ago that, essentially, Hong Kong’s existence is a smear on China. Everything about it represents the shame and bad times China had not so long ago."

"It's an unfortunate reality for HK citizens but you're right or rather, the history is right. Nobody is going to save HK because there are no grounds for them to do so. It is China's territory and any physical interference is borderline declaration of war. Any other interference, China just won't give a fuck about. The sole existence of HK as autonomous territory is an offence for the regime and will not stand in the rather near future. If HK is willing to get decimated to become pro-democracy martyrs, all the power for them and they have my sympathies as someone who lived through the latter part of anti-communist revolution here in Europe."

"I sort of agree.

I feel really bad for the people in Hong Kong, just like I feel bad for the people in mainland china to live under a cutthroat dictatorship like that. I wish that this will work out for the Hong Kong protesters, but I am not hopeful. Maybe I'm a pessimist, but I just don't see how that would happen? Given what they are doing to the Uyghurs, it just seems like they are willing to take bad press and have no regard for people's rights. And no one is going to go to war with China over Hong Kong. Did you notice recently they recently tortured a former UK consulate staffer and then basically took the position it's Britain that owes them an apology for their propaganda narrative?

Yes, there are threats to democracy all over the world. But I don't think the above poster is wrong for pointing out that they are not all the same, and Hong Kong's position is special and honestly especially unfortunate. They already are under the umbrella of vicious dictatorship, who has been eroding their rights for some time and has no intent of stopping. They are a part of China, and while they may have agreed to certain things when Britain handed Hong Kong over, Britain has no way to enforce this. It's not like they have any jurisdiction or can take Hong Kong back.

Hong Kong's position seems most similar to those of people already within China, sadly. 

But I'm not an expert, I just listen to/read some news, maybe I'm wrong?"
Den*
"But thats the thing, they never *were* independent to begin with. For most of history Hong Kong had essentially been part of what was considered China through various dynasties until the First Opium War and at the end of that it was transferred to British rule as a Crown Colony. In 1898 the 'lease agreement' was made that Britain would have control of Hong Kong for 99 years before return to China, it was during British colonial rule that Hong Kong really thrived and became what it's known as today with it's industry, public transport, trams, buses, airlines etc 

However in 1997 Britain had to give up the 'lease' and abide by the promise, not just because if the government said ""Nah that agreement isn't valid anymore"" you'd get all the anti-Colonialists around the world getting all angry but also because Britain wasn't in any real position to go to war with China over it even if the government wanted to force the issue (I doubt the US would have offered much assistance given their views on *other* countries colonialism but obviously not Hawaii or Puerto Rico etc). So it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. Hong Kong was then transferred to Chinese sovereignty with the whole One Country, Two Systems agreement China agreed to abide by until 2047 so there wasn't any point it was some independent nation with it's own army and everything, it was Chinese, then British, then Chinese again it's just this time China is Communist instead of Monarchist.

Now obviously you get the people who go ""Britain should never have given Hong Kong back!"" but clearly have no actual solution as to how exactly Britain could have done that since China's military is right across the border whilst Britain would have had to dispatch a military task force that could take weeks to arrive (Assuming they could considering the shrinking size of the British military due to government budget cuts and so on) by which time China would have likely overrun Hong Kong unless nuclear missile strikes were threatened and so on. So it was either say no to the handover and have lots of people around the world moaning and complaining about Imperialism and colonialism as well as the obviously more serious possible imminent war with China *or* say yes to the handover sticking to diplomatic treaties and keeping their word even though it means Hong Kong becoming under Communist control but at the same time making China agree beforehand that they can't 'take over' until 2047, neither was much of a good choice but one avoided possible major war, a war in which Britain couldn't have won without NATO ally help but obviously the NATO treaty conveniently doesn't apply to colonial territories."
"> Just because they've never been independent, in your opinion

It's not an opinion, it's pretty much historical fact. Since around 200BC with the Qin dynasty the people living in the area known as Hong Kong were under what is essentially Chinese governmental/dynastical rule as part of Chinese territory through the centuries, then it was transferred to British Colonial rule, then back to Chinese rule again except this time a Communist government. They can *fight* for independence if they want to but they have no military whilst China does, a very big one at that right across the border and *inside* HK too as [they have garrisons in Hong Kong itself.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Hong_Kong_Garrison) Nowhere did I say they couldn't fight for it I simply questioned what their end goal was as 'fighting a war of independence yehaw' is not a realistic outcome of this current scenario without foreign military assistance (Like the Americans for instance got *a lot* of) which is also an unlikely outcome."
"Unfortunately there is not much we are currently in a position to do except lodge formal protests or if it really came to it some kind of sanctions or embargoes that would more than likely damage the West as much as China. I doubt the US, the most powerful opposing military force in the region would threaten any military backing on behalf of the Hong Kong protesters and risk a war with China over one city in a foreign land either so I'm really not sure what we could *actually* do to force China's hand.

Now China *could* find a way to back down whilst 'saving face' for the most part, for instance with the recent election they could pretend to 'accept the outcome of the vote' so they can look 'pro-democratic' as if they're kindly backing down and all that even though we know they're not, but in reality they'd be 'cooling it off' for a few years as they can play the waiting game. In 27 years HK will be theres by agreement so they've got time to wait and probably won't want to push it if it'll cause too much of a backlash if it drags on well into 2020 but I imagine another opportunity for something will arise in a few years and it'll start again because HK had similar quite big protests back in 2014 and 2005 etc"

It wouldn't be nuclear. China won't nuke Taiwan. They still need the island
I doubt it would become nuclear. Regular war is easy enough for China and I don't think anyone with nukes cares enough about Taiwan to start the apocalypse over it.
That's like old school warfare. These days you kill a country/take over a country through economics and key infrastructure ownership
"No, that's not how war works.

Taiwan is a small island that is within striking distance from all Chinese land based missiles. Taiwan is also entirely covered by Chinese land based radar and early warning systems. A barrage of missiles turns Taiwan into dust. 

Everyone in Taiwan knows this but its seldom mentioned, including certain media outlets who is ""hard on China"" but acknowledges Chinese military action would be catastrophic.

The vast majority of the population in Taiwan prefer status quo."
"Mans think china is still feudal, mountains might matter to sword wielding troops but missiles dont give a fuckkkk"
And the US backs Taiwan big time too
"Because the existing government is the same one that fled to Taiwan nearly a century ago, it retained its previous claims of territory(mainland). Canadians is to Americans as mainland chinese are to people of Taiwan(both those who had nothing to do with the mainland since the 1700s and those who descended from refugees fleeing from People's Republic of China). Save for the minority of senile hard right-winged KMT, the Taiwanese do not consider their identity as interchangeable to that of the mainland. 

But the moment that Taiwan decides ""This is bullshit. Can we just be Taiwan and not call ourselves China?"" 

The mainland will perceive the stripping of the ""Chinese identity"" as a break from the status quo. Does launching a military invasion and throwing away their opportunity to overtake the US as a world superpower by 2040 sound sane and logical? Probably not. But conflicts don't happen because people in power are smart."
"Hmm. Not exactly. I don't think anyone in Taiwan thinks ROC will ever control the mainland again. I mean, maybe in principle some people think that, but no sane person thinks it's going to happen for real."
"There is no ""right"" decision here. If China invaded Hong Kong it would only lead to a sanction fight that would hurt America probably more."
"Hitler was also the proponent of an ideology that believed militarism wasn't just good, but necessary for the strong to subject(or eliminate) the weak and was also running an economy in such an unsustainable way that pillaging conquered countries was the only way to make it work which lead to a world war that killed millions. China does not have an ideology or an economy that requires them to conquer others, so I don't think a nazi comparison is either fair or useful."
"Not an expert either, but I have been studying the situation as much as I can, and you're bang on. There's a bit of history with Hong Kong that helps to inform the issue. Hong Kong was signed over to Britain during the opium wars, and was later leased for 99 years, which termed up in the 1980's. By then it was a very successful trade island turned manufacturing turned financial powerhouse, embracing capitalism and democracy.

This was a very delicate situation, and the two governments agreed to kick the can down the road. Hong Kong would be returned to China, if they agreed that for 50 years after it would be allowed to retain its unique culture and government. This went into force in 1997. China changed a lot between the 1980's and today. They industrialized and modernized and turned into one of the largest exporters of a large number of goods. They have a lot more geopolitical force than they did then, and the strongest nations in the world were too busy infighting to pay much attention. There's no telling what the political landscape will look like 30 years from now, so the PRC struck while the iron was hot.

It must be said here, Hong Kong is a huge embarrassment to China. The Opium Wars are still taught today about the evils of outside nations, and Hong Kong is a living representation of that. It is also a risky influence to have to close, like east and west Berlin. Beyond that, Hong Kong is tactically important. It could be used as a base of operations and a separate front if the Republic of China ever chooses to enforce their own claim on the country, and Hong Kong has plenty of reason to be sympathetic to the cause. The PRC will never allow it to return to western control, and they cannot allow it to become an independent City State."
"Yes of course, they are f'ed. They had a taste of western freedom and saw it taken away under a 40 year ""get used to it"" window. The older generations didn't care because they would be dead by then or because they had the money to move out, and like you said at the time there was not much they could do. 

The only way it will change would be through a internal regime change in the mailand and Xi appears to have full control for now.

Their only hope is they can stir the pot enough that a modern democracy can move in but with so many people moving out of poverty now it might be a generation too soon for people to realise that the regime is not normal."

"We're actually seeing alot of this right now all over the world, Hong Kong is center stage  because of their unity in defying their government and their standing in the world. Other populations aren't as organized or as well off and are also failing to be recognized as humans with rights."

"Well, yeah, but it also really depends on whether the U.S. would actually defend Taiwan if it came down to it. I don't have too much faith in that.

Also, the military in Taiwan could not defend against China's military for long. They depend on more powerful countries coming to their aid if something happens."

You do realize complacency seems fine until you dont want to be complacent anymore and by then it's too late.
mfw Americans are literally indoctrinated to believe this
The nice thing about digital ownership is it’s really easy to wipe out. If China was pressuring the US enough the US could simply stop recognizing Chinese ownership of American property and seize those assets.
Nationalization.
Just take the property back from them.
"The only reason? How about those guns honed in on Seoul, Einstein?"
I mean most of my neighbors are Chinese-American so idk what to tell you
"Ignore that shit dude.   99% of people are cool but 1% are twats who make a lot of noise.

Lmao where were u in dc? Im chinese dude born in dc and lived in nova all my life. Racism doesnt exist here.
"I’m American and this have never witnessed this. Muslim/ middle eastern tons, black people some, Asian people pretty much none.

"I would generally agree with you. 


Except history is rife with powderkeg events that have led to a drastic change in course. Think events like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the mongol invasions of the middle east or pearl harbor. 

Hong Kong might be one of those moments."
Can’t help people who don’t help themselves. This is the first real push for democracy we’ve seen in the last 20 years or so. The ‘Arab Spring’ wasn’t fundamentally about democracy.
"""Our People""?  Are you naturalized?  If not, they're not really any more your people than they are ours.

Who do you think is behind the propaganda, specifically?  Which government or organization?"
"Yeah. People don't give a fuck. We can be momentarily horrified but we spend our whole lives looking for excitement and horror. It all blends together. And while I wouldn't dream of equating the two, many Americans experience unspeakable things on an extremely frequent basis. That's why one day either America falls or the world ends. If Hong Kong falls we aren't far behind, and that's the only message that's going to matter to most people. When people can start caring about more than their immediate surroundings and future, we can live in a world where all that stuff is taken care of anyway. It's time to get rid of superpowers and warring governments so that when atrocities of this nature occur they can be properly neutralized by the literal rest of the world. Humans are one species, and we do not need to keep secrets from each other or plot to destroy each other."
You are mostly correct.

"The account you just replied to is a copy paste bot, don't worry about it :)"

Yeah that’s just how it’s pronounced when talking quickly. Or at all.
"I'm quite certain they have been told that is what will happen. 

TO them."
"Taiwan's defense strategy is ""Hold down the fort until the U.S. arrives to back us up."""
"No, that's not how war works. 

There is no point in destroying Taiwan and killing everybody. China would rather have Taiwan exist as it does now than conquer a country of dead people, plus becoming an international outcast for a war of aggression that kills millions of people out of pure spite. If China murders Taiwan, they immediately lose all exports to Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States. It would be a terrible move for everyone and nobody would win, least of all China.

Long-range missiles are a blunt instrument, only effective with no ground troops in *total war*. This is not what China will do."
It takes way more than missiles to conquer a country.
"I mean, Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, etc are also all within Taiwan's striking distance from both our land and sea based missile systems. A barrage of missiles onto Taiwan would equal a barrage of missiles back to some of China's major population centers.

I don't think any expert in Taiwan honestly believes China can take Taiwan in a matter of hours. That's more of a CCP talking point, if anything."
so in return they are burning down their city with anarchic criminality masquerading as democracy; ironically doing a 1000 fold more damage than the ccp ever did.
"If the word terrorist means nothing to you now, that may be a you problem."
There's not a snowball's chance in hell that China does anything to Japan outside of *maybe* threats and posturing.
Because outside of personal motivation (which is honestly often lacking in teenagers) there’s no drive to learn another language as English is the most useful.  In other countries there is a huge desire to learn English for better employment or opportunities or even to use the internet more so much so that people pay for extra schooling or tutors and learning younger.
"That's not the same thing at all. There's no widespread system in which all children in the U.S. learn German from a young age. In a lot of countries, English is a mandatory school subject starting around elementary school. English learning is a HUGE industry."
"Not really, it is them protesting their own governments influenced by the CIA and the IMF. Like always"
"Hong kong is not a bad place to live, especially as a foreigner."
If China tonight they could get away with another Tiammamin they would have already pulled the trigger on it. They know full well trillions in wealth and human capitol will dissapear overnigh. A deserted island isn't going to do them much good.
"You know, there are countries that have higher gun ownership than American. They also have affordable mental health care so people don't go on genocidal rampages. But let's blame guns."
Chinese owned land within the US can be just as easily taken away and would be if things were to ever get that bad.
Chinese and English are both official languages of Hong Kong
Their money's bs anyway (China's) with their conversion rate fixing. Why we even tolerate that still baffles me. Sure we make money from them but we're getting screwed too. If you need a new chair you don't sell your ass for it.
"This..Nobody ever thinks about how much more damaging it'd be for China than us if we nationalized everything.

Okay, sure, they have production and things would cost more, but, what would they do with all that stuff? Africa gonna buy your slavery margins products with their pitiful wages? Given that China outsources to Africa and Vietnam, will lower level markets even want the goods they already produce? Why wouldn't they be incentivized to revolt and keep everything for themselves with American support?

China also is in need of resources...if there was a major move, they're going to be SOL as the industrial wasteland with no resources and no incoming capital from their main market (hint: their main adversary, us).

Then we can go back to American 1950s and 1960s industry levels and people can have jobs again. Sure, it won't be heaven or easy, but, we already have the spaces and the tools. It was there before--it can be done again.

\--------

If America ever did to China what Venuzuela and other c ountries did to their foreign properties in nationalization, that'd be it for them. They'd be stuck with factories they cannot supply, to produce products they cannot sell at margins that justify the system they previously engaged in, in terrible environmental conditions.

All this before even the bombs, nukes, or commandos happen"
"> the US could simply stop recognizing Chinese ownership of American property and seize those assets.

Heh, then you would have foreign investment flooding out of your country in droves.  Your economy would literally collapse overnight.  I don't think you have thought this through."
I'm scared that Valve has conversations like this.
"What? Is this a real comment? What digital asset ownership? What are they pressuring? Why would the US completely destroy their own financial credibility to ""Gotcha"" the Chinese over a few billion in assets. You are talking out your ass bud. Please prove anything you just said."
"In Canada? We happily break up state industry and sell it off to economic predators all the time. We had a conservative pm candidate run who promised to raffle off the entire state healthcare apparatus and suddenly Canadian conservatives were shouting for the right to go bankrupt over a twisted ankle. We're walking things backwards. Hell when I was a kid, the government owned the telephone service. They flew technicians to remote Inuit villages to get them a telephone. Now it's owned by two predatory corporations and we are getting fucked. I remember going with my mom to the Phone Store (government operated) where you chose your free telephone every so often. You could even pay extra for this brand new tech called ""caller ID"" it was some spaceman shit. They had phones on a cascading wall like they were air Jordan's"

"In addition to the common knowledge that a ""50 Cent Army"" exists, Reddit received a $150 million investment from Tencent,  a Chinese multinational conglomerate. I can't believe how many users are supporting what is blatantly propaganda perpetuated by the invisible hand that controls this site. People are grinning while they let governments shovel shit into their mouths. People want WW3 but don't consider the people who will die for their fake cause."

"For one, China. They've very specifically looked back at things before Mao to create their current place."
"Lmao no country will ever nuke another, especially a nuclear power themselves, as that's when the threat of MAD comes into the narrative."
"They don't have to fire them. Taiwan is in their range. They've basically got a gun to their head. They will say you can have a lot of money and be subject to us, or you can have no money and be dead. And the people in charge will do what the people in charge of Hong Kong did."
"China just wants to build military bases there. Thry don't care about Taiwan's opinion, meaning that won't kill everyone"
im pretty sure if china obliterates the island with any number of missles they have at their disposal there wont be much left in the form of resistance let alone resources for people to use to even fight back. The EU/US is certainly not going to help either.
"No,no, they won't conquer.
Think Civilization games. Bomb the city and build a new one on your own. That's more like how it'd go down."
"Maybe it's a problem with governments justifying denying human rights by labeling anyone that disagrees a ""terrorist"""
"Why is that? The media loves the terrorist label. Try to identify the real source of what they are talking about. Religious extremists? An anti-government coup? A bored child that wants attention by doing bad things? A crazy individual with a gun?

Terrorist is just some broad term now for what we deem as bad people, or something we are supposed to hate."

The West isn’t going to sit idly by and watch Taiwan get murdered. Almost certainly China will become isolated as no one will trade with them and support would be given to Taiwan through backwater channels.
"Except at the same time China is obliterating Taiwan, Taiwan will be obliterating Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and any other major city that also happens to be within the Taiwanese missile range.

So now China needs to focus it's military resources in the area of Taiwan, what is going to happen along it's thousands of miles of other land borders? Tibet, East Turkestan, India, Vietnam, South China Sea, etc etc? China has the people, but not the resources <military hardware>."
"Ah yes. You not understanding what terrorism means is actually the government's fault. And uh, tell me again how the government just labels everyone they disagree with a terrorist? That's the dumbest assertion I've heard in a while."
"No, it isn't, no matter how much you want it to be. Terrorism is terrorism, like it or not. A guy with a gun, a Christian extremist, a government inspired coup, all literally, by definition, terrorism.

Again, if you want to normalize terrorism, then go ahead, but expect to he ket with resistance from people who actually know what it is."

Welcome to reddit my brother
YOU UPVOTED IT
Ouch
This is why I watermark my memes
Aww. I feel so bad. I will downvote it for you. I hope that more people can see this post
u/THE_MEME_LORD_420 SHOW URSELF YA BITCH
u/THE_MEME_LORD_420 COME OUT AND FACE US YOU COWARD
Yikesss
The repost is literraly right above this post
That is a quality meme I can see why it was stolen. I'm sure you would like a way to protect the memes you made. Fortunately for you there is a way! Just put a watermark on it my guy.
Don’t worry these posts get lots of karma too
How do you think r/dankmemes feels
F
I've never seen a more dodgy-looking username.
"What a fitting username, too"
Why did you upvoted your stolen meme?
"Rip Tim, take an upvote"
Just report his post a repost
"Press F to pay respect...
1minute silence"
Instead of talking shit about the other we should all upvote the original post
f
When that was stolen from r/memes
This is why I begin to get bored of reddit so I try browse Instagram then it's literally all boomer memes jesus shit so I come back.
"Someone stole mine too and got 4K upvotes while mine died in new. Like, how does that work?"
"Yeah that happens. My friend showed me that my most upvoted meme got reposted on Instagram. 

Also apparently it got posted on a furry sub but I don’t want that in my history so I haven’t bothered to check."
What a dog cunt
I went to his account and took my upvote back
"Downvoted his post, upvoted yours."
"I often encounter situations where friends and acquaintances would wonder ""Why does he not have a girlfriend?""  - some think the explanation lies in that I am a stud. 

&#x200B;

The reality is that for whatever reason very few women find me desirable. likable? Sure, but not intimately desireable. 

&#x200B;

Most like to be a friend of mine but not beyond it"
When you realise since this has been posted the meme stealer has received even more upvotes
r/KarmaCourt
Thats what happens when you post on me_irl
Fcking meme stealer I'm calling the cops
"r/KarmaPoliceDepartment

we got a problem"
Its not fun
"Guys, back off, he's the meme lord. What can we do? Obviously all memes are his from the moment of creation."
r/karmacourt
"Oof upvoted the meme too, it was good. I will downvote it and upvote yours."
"I upvoted this post

What have i done?"
F
Upvotes anyway
"Upvoting the meme stolen from you is possibly the most passive-aggressive, Chad move I've seen in a while."
this is not okie dokie
this subreddit is full of reposts lol
"Big fat F, will downvote that man"
ooh call outs
"Meme gets stolen,upvotes the reposted meme"
Can someone link the repost so we can go report it?
Looks like it's time for a good ol' fashioned witch hunt. /s
Cause he posted it on a more popular sub reddit
"u/THE_MEME_LORD_420

You pussy"
F
time to begin the hunt
f
r/aaro stole it as well
r/KarmaCourt
I downvoted all meme lords post and comments
"All his downvotes he’s getting are good compensation for all the karma he got, good job team."
"Am I the only personal on the internet who thinks you don’t own the memes you create? As long as it’s posted in a different location, it’s fair game."
Do all teachers love cheesy meme posters?
F
It happens to me all the time
Dude I’m so sry I upvoted the other one
r/KarmaCourt
Honestly I’m pretty sure I’ve been seeing this around for years now
Its all about knowing your audience
Everybody do your part as a teenager by downvoting EVERY SINGLE ONE of this mans reposts until his karma is negative.
Here’s a comment so hopefully you get more of the karma you deserve
why u upvote

I love that you're a teenager too ((:
"Well, you got this much upvotes because he stole your meme."
"wait wait wait...

You're complaining that the meme you posted **ONE MONTH AGO** got posted to another sub yesterday?

Like, you do realise the whole point of memes is that they're meant to spread, right? You don't ""own"" memes, you share them with the world and if you're lucky someone else will share your humour.

/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid"
Get used to it
Oh boo hoo someone posted your joke somewhere else on the internet what a scandal
Jeez bro it’s just a bit of karma who cares
At first i didn't believe since me_irl is some what known to repost memes without credit so i reverse google searched this and manually reviewed each of the page's this isn't me calling out OP

Blocked him
We should downvote all his posts and comments to compensate the stolen karma.
"I’m not saying he’s totally in the clear but he did say that his friend sent it to him and he posted it there. He may have had no intention of stealing it, again not saying he’s totally in the clear as he could be lying but the story seems plausible"
Hey u/rofl_gamer we have a contract on u/THE_MEME_LORD_420
ANSWER US u/THE_MEME_LORD_420
bruh I think he deleted all his posts like on this exact minute.
downvoting all posts by this guy. we  never know from whom those memes he posted are stolen
"Just spent a good half hour downvoting all his posts and comments.  


#I'm doing my part!"
Just got done down voting everything this scum has posted
that has actually happened to me irl
There's a really funny Key & Peele sketch on that
that actually happens to me everytime i tell a joke
I got anxiety so i always dont yell out my jokes and just tell my friend but now if i tell them they give me credit

But... that’s the guy he’s talking about
"pretty sure this would be witch hunting too lmao, but fucking hell, its just a meme, something that is meant to be posted around the internet"
It's not about the karma. It's about JUSTICE

/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid"
"Too late, his comment karma is now in the negatives, lol"
He should have deleted the post though
 he steals alot of memes every post has atleast 3 people saying meme stealer
Downvote farmer it seems
My friend does that to me every time I tell him a joke when the group is together
that has actually happened to r/me_irl*
"The amount of times it happened to me in elementary school and middle school is insaane  
After that I just went full dead inside so yall can't steal my shit no more ^^^haha"
and we wont let that happen to you in Reddit

He has made alot of shitpost so far. No memes from 'the meme lord' yet
Agreed
I did my downvotiliy duty
On it. And then we will...
If it ain't your do not post it.
Hes lying all his memes are stolen with people in comments saying it
Ok boomer
Get this mans 69 downdoots
"Oh fuck what have we done 

We just killed him :0"
# Wish I was *High On Pot-neuse*
Wish there were more people like you
Oh ok oops
Hey. I know you.
"Where’s the watermark, I don’t think it’s obvious enough ^/s"
"You just did cringe, return to zero"
lets turn his karma negative bois
Agreed
Yes sir
Do you have any idea how much of reddit would disappear if people stopped doing that?
"So no memes ever get spread? I get the sentiment, the guy doesn't deserve the karma but it's not like the original creator loses anything. It would be a different case if someone stole art because that's their income"
"So you think every time someone posts a meme they have to declare whether they're the originator or not?

...and why has literally nobody been doing this in the past? Oh, that's right, because it's fucking stupid."
just stop.
"Nah, we haven't killed his post karma yet"
Hello
You must be mistaken...
agreed
It would be even better.
Well somebody maybe likea collecting karma and to him it is more important than money.
"Yes, otherwise that's what we call stealing a meme. No, they're just karmawhores trying to get internet points off of someone else's content."
people like to think of poorly edited internet jokes like they actually have value so they throw a fucking fit when someone shares it even though that's the fucking point of memes
Hi
agreed
Yeah im not saying if reposts are good or not. Just that reddit is full of it
Are you actually fucking serious? Karma are digitals points that cannot be used on anything. Nobody would think that's more important than money.
"You're right. It's sad really, but it doesn't mean credit shouldnt be given where credit is due. Even then, no one really cares who made the meme ever."
There are all kinds of patients in this world.
Comment
History teacher memer here
"What about people from history who were the memers before memes were a thing? Like, Proto-memes."
I am in this and I love it
Don't for get about historians who are memers
What movie is this from?
I'm surrounded by... *teachers?*
"I'm a simple man, I see a PoI meme, I upvote"
Evolution my friend
There is always a bigger fish
The deadliest combo ever
Those are exceptionally rare
"Was going to go down the History teacher route and was strongly considering using memes as a form of teaching aid

Any teachers actually do this? Satisfy my curiosity!"
The true OPs
"The value of a historian is to avoid repeating history, and the value of memes is the streamlines spreading of an idea. Its like they were made for eachother."
A lot of history stuff that gets posted here is really just wrong tho
I think this is Meta. But hilarious Meta!
Show yourselves teachers
Found the history teacher who is a history memer
History memers who are history teachers
Just wish my pupils found the memes funny
Is this person of interest?
"If ""history is written by the winners"" and pure evil could win, then history teachers are  potentially the most evil enablers in history.  Brainwash isn't possible without the history teacher."
Lmao how tf does this qualify as a meme about history. This sub needs some stricter quality control.
I thought gods weren't real

How does it feel to have the power of a god?
At what school do you teach and is there a seat free in your course.

"TV show, Person of Interest. Amazing show, though it gets going pretty slowly. Picks up a lot of pace later on though"
Omw to start my class up on the age of exploration. There are dozens of us! Dozens!
"Depends on what you mean by that. If you're talking about putting a meme or two every few slides to help contextualize the subject in a modern way, then yes, it's an awesome way to increase the engagement of your students and I've seen a lot of teachers do that.

 Don't know if you're aware of a YouTube channel by a history teacher called ""Mr Terry History"", but one thing he says he does is he always shows Bill Wurtz's ""The history of the world"" to his classes at the start and end of the year, and then they realize how much more context and knowledge they have now compared to before because they understand more of the subjects and jokes on the video."
"It is, season 4, somewhere around episode 9 or 10 I think."
Daddy issues are pretty common in teachers.  In my experience at least.
Oh wow.

The one thing I cannot stand is how he whispers all the time!
"slow start, fantastic middle, terrible ending"
I love that show.
At least he's trying to learn from his past
Nice.
What experience do you have regarding teachers with daddy issues?
Slaves rise up
Gotta agree there haha.
How do you know it's a he?
"Trying to learn from *all of our past*

They must be stopped. They'll become too powerful."
oh yes
"You are right. The finale was very good. However, the finale wasn't great comparing to the rest of the show. But it's dead body still better than most of popular tv show."

"This is the reason some snakes have extremely potent venom for such small prey. A lot of rodents and smaller mamals develop immunity to it over generations, and the snakes with more potent venom are more likely to survive. This cycle continues and the snakes become more and more deadly. It's an evolutionary arms race."

“Ssssssssooommmee liquor was spilled on the barroom floor, and the bar was closed for that night;

When out came a little brown mouse, who sang in the pale moonlight;

Heeeeee lapped up the liquor on the barroom floor and back on his haunches he sat;

And all that night you could hear him rooooaarr...BRING ON THE GOSH-DARN CAT”

It is now my head canon that the Grasshopper Mouse drinks heavily."
Commas... commas are good things!
Can you imagine the surprise when a cowboy figured that shit out?
"The howl of these mice can be distinguished in terms of species, sex and individuals.

Normally it's always the mice who get the short end of the stick from nature. It's like all the mice came together, and at the height of their desperation, they created the ultimate weapon."
"If it's nicknamed the werewolf mouse, why is it called the grasshopper mouse?"
Coolest Mouse in existence. I did like the voice over on the clip though way too much orientated towards kids.

"Absolutely adorable little critter! 

It’s howl is extremely cute! 

Kind of surprised that a similar mouse hasn’t adapted to live in Australia."
I watched this documentary while tripping balls with my friends. That battle with the scorpion was so intense. The mouse brutally kills the scorpion and then rage howls at sky like a little Rambo werewolf. We were laughing for about 20 min straight in tears over that.
This is about as Skaven as it can get
What a badass little mouse!
It does nothing to grasshopper?
What doesn’t kill you makes you fucking high
Muad'Dib!
"This little fella is so gangsta, I love it!"
I thought only hotdogs were immune to scorpion venom....
"She's a wolf in mouse clothing

they don't howl at the moon and I've never heard that name.  source: me I live in the Sonoran desert and have heard these mice before.
So fucking cool!
Wow.  Reminds me a little of the cricket sound being slowed down.
And it's narrated by Elastigirl!
Thank you for posting this. Fucking awesome

"The same thing also happened in reverse with garter  snakes and rough skin newts. The newts developed a tetrodotoxin as a defense, and the garter snakes built immunity to it. These days the newt is one of the most toxic creatures in the Pacific Northwest. A documentary a while back filmed an invasive bullfrog eating one, and the poison killed the frog so fast the live newt crawled right back out and continued on its merry way."

"She made her own bed, she can lie in it."
"She could have just said, “I don’t know anyone who reads.”"
"She doesn't like to be called a liar, then why is continually lying?"
It's the **Anybody I know** part that bothers me. She most likely only knows 2 hamsters.
" **1. During the president’s briefings, aides were told to reduce information down to PowerPoints with a single bullet point**

Early in Trump’s presidency, the author said that Oval Office briefers were first told not to bring “lengthy documents” or “summaries” and, if they had to bring paper to their meeting with Trump, to use PowerPoint slides. But that soon proved to be too much information for the president, who “couldn’t digest too many slides.” Briefers were then told to keep things to a maximum of three bullet points, even for complicated issues, like “military readiness or the federal budget.” And when the president still struggled to comprehend the three bullet points, briefers were advised to keep their meetings with Trump down to just a single bullet point.

“Come in with one main point and repeat it — over and over again, even if the president inevitably goes off on tangents — until he gets it. Just keep steering the subject back to it. ONE point,” the author wrote of the advice West Wing aides gave briefers. “Because you cannot focus the commander in chief’s attention on more than one goddamned thing over the course of a meeting, okay?”

For those who ignored this advice and came in prepared to have “robust policy discussions on momentous national topics,” the official wrote, “they invariably paid the price.”

“‘What the f— is this?’ the president would shout, looking at a document one of them handed him. ‘These are just words. A bunch of words. It doesn’t mean anything.’ Sometimes he would throw the papers back on the table. He definitely wouldn’t read them,” the official recalled.

Source:  [https://www.thewrap.com/warning-anonymous-trump-official-highlights-takeaways/](https://www.thewrap.com/warning-anonymous-trump-official-highlights-takeaways/)"
"The next time a reporter asks Trump a question it better be ""what are the titles of the last two books you read?""

And they better repeat it when he rambles for five minutes instead of answering the question."
"Either she is lying her ass off, or she really only knows people more illiterate and ignorant than Trump... and I don't know which is true."
"It's weird to me that these judges haven't read the transcript yet.

*The President used hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money, appropriated by congress, to solicit a bribe from a foreign country to help him in the 2020 election*

Surely it's easy."
"Menus don't count, dear."
All this praising Trump as a demi-god-king is seriously so bizarre. Dangerous as hell. What has happened to this country?
Sarah Slanders is a liar. Her words are more worthless than pondscum.
Sarah knows a shit load of illiterate people.
He likes his reading short and simple. Do comics count? What about picture books.
WHY?! Why do they have to lie constantly about everything all the time? Why has the greatest nation on earth been reduced to a fucking meme joke by 4-Chan types? What the fuck did we do so wrong to justify the entire GOP to work as hard as they can to destroy our entire government?
"Makes sense. Trump keeps telling people to ""READ THE TRANSCRIPT"" because Republicans are ""too busy"" to read the 5 page summary of the transcript. And the only Republican, to my knowledge, that has read the 400+ page Mueller Report is no longer a Republican.

The Republican Party, ladies and gentlemen.

This is the party that criticized the Affordable Care Act simply because of how many pages it consisted of. They stacked up their ""health care"" bill next to it and said it was much better simply because it was fewer pages.

And let's not forget Hermain Cain who said if he was President he would only allow small bills that were 3 pages."
she does not want to be a liar so she lies multiple people around Trump have said he will not read and he has said it himself in the past and reading twitter does not count.
"Whenever I hear Trump speak about geopolitics and related history, I immediately think: Yeah, this guy, who is incapable of finishing a sentence or thought, and writes in all-caps with a sharpie ...

reads a lot of books."
That's a great picture of Trump. This is exactly how I pictured him when he met Putin privately for 2 hrs in Helsinki last year  ...
"So I guess that Dr. Seuss subscription really paid off. 

Trump versions: 

“Oh the Crimes you’ll commit”

“If I Ran the White House”

“Green Eggs and Covfefe”

“Mitch the Turtle”

“The Snitches”

“And to Think I Saw it On Pennsylvania Ave.”

“Mr. Brown can Collude, Can You?”

“I Can Grab 30 Pussies Today!”"
"Even if I actually liked Donald, just based on the way he communicates I'd be hard pressed to believe he reads anything besides headlines with his name in them."
"I’m sorry, but this is just the funniest thing to have happened in this whole presidency. After all the shit we have gone through and how idiotic trump is, an administration completely open about how much it lies tries to send propaganda to show the more uninformed population that trump reads a shit ton because trump obviously wants people to think he is the smartest man ever. Out of all the insecurities, he can’t give that at rest, he needs to reiterate that he is a stable genius"
"Reads Twitter you mean, right?"
I dare her to look anyone in the eyes and say that.
Shameless lying sycophant lies again.
"If you count his face being buried in Twitter all day, searching desperately for a Russian bot saying something positive about him so he can retweet it, she could be right."
"to be fair, look at the kind of people she knows"
Reading twitter doesn’t count.
"“Trump reads (Twitter) more than anyone I know”

I mean, that’s probably true."
Is it possible her job as Trump’s bullshit conveyor was actually holding her back from lying even harder?
"Maybe the back of ketchup packets, but anything else? not really. 

""reads more than anybody I know"" for the guy that wants ""killer graphics,"" like pictures, videos and charts, and often interrupts intelligence briefings with questions and unrelated asides, favors tiny ""nuggets"" of intelligence and information that can fit on a single sheet of paper. Who will only read something if his name is mentioned many times. Give me a fucking break. This shit-gibbon has the reading level of a middle schooler and the temperment of a toddler.

It's kind of sad that crazy eyes isn't even getting paid to lie and she still getting the knee pads out for trump."
"How can he between all the golf trips? I mean, as a writer, I'm constantly reading both my work I'm editing and absorbing other stories. Constantly, unless I'm at work."
Does Sarah Huckabee Sanders strike you as the kind of person who hangs out with a lot of readers?
"LMAO then how the fuck does he have the vocabulary of a third grader who has been held back several years. If he reads so much, how does he manage to misspell like 3 words per tweet"
"Tbf, he probably does quite a lot of reading on twitter while hes taking his mcdonalds shits every 15 minutes"
She must know a lot of illiterate people then...
Omg the people she knows must be ...
"I mean if Tweets and Fox News Chyrons count as reading, sure. 

Just like we're all not wasting time browsing Reddit, we're *reading.* LoOk at how well-read and intellectual we all are."
"""I am concerned that no one talks about me any longer""  - what she really meant"
"loOk, I don't like when you guys call out my lies and call me a liar."
"I wonder if Trump supporters realize how much their fealty to their ""dear leader"" resembles North Korea. It is really quite shocking how fast something like this can happen, especially in the US."
"She doesn't know a lot of folks, it seems."
As untrue as this obviously is - it is also suspiciously worded. Who else would phrase it “more than anybody I know”? Almost like it was dictated to her.
"Do not pass Dancing With The Stars, go directly to Fox News"
"She talking about Twitter print outs? You know how you know this is a lie. The fact that it had to be said. If he did read any reports, it would be seen in his ability to speak, write, and how he presents information.

The fact that he can't even do one of those things well, means she is lying put of her ass."
"If she didn’t want to be called a liar, then she shouldn’t have lied so fucking much."
I could put up with her horseshit slightly more if she wasn’t also a holier than thou mega church type. Fucking yuck.
My daddy is mike huckabee. Enough said!
Sarah Sanders only reads the highlights of Kardashian news for the day.
She's a fatass water buffalo....
This seems odd coming from the daughter of a pastor. You'd think that Christians would constantly be reading since God is .... an author.
Look.
Wait this is not a lie. Everybody else in her life doesn't know how to read at all.
My five-year-old reads more looking at the dried puddle of cat vomit at the bottom of the stairs.
"I wonder how many times he's read ""Mein Covfefe?"""
Completing coloring books counts as reading?
"If they wanted the guy they imagine in their lies, they would get Obama."
TIL I being stumped by Goofus and Gallant counts as reading.
"I hope every headline story about her will now contain the phrase:

In completely unrelated news, she also doesn’t want to be called a liar. 

Thank you."
"I’m gonna go with: She doesn’t read for fun, and doesn’t know anyone who does. Therefor, any reading is “...more than anybody I know”."
"In other news, apparently Sarah Huckabee Sanders still exists."
I don't understand why so many people go to such lengths to lie for such an unaccomplished idiot.
"Alright lOok, that may be a true statement"
This is like the longest episode of the Twilight Zone ever.
"Just to clarify, do his own tweets count?"
She's giving Trump the same look like Monica Lewinsky used to give Clinton
"If you don't like being called a liar, then quit lying, Aunt Lydia!"
She isn't lying. Mango Mussolini does read. Every. Single. Day. The wrapper. Maybe 7 or 8 times daily. 'Cheeseburger'.
I could see this being true. But only because it takes him so long.
I'm sure he spends more time reading a single sentence than anyone she knows.
I’ve never seen trump with a book. And didn’t a general of his call him out for being a non reader?
She doesnt know a lot of people. Actually..  she knows 2. Herself and Trump.
Pretty sure she meant “rapes.”
"I mean, she doesn't have to be wrong.  
I'm sure he's accumulated many an hour on Twitter."
It could be true. She could know a lot of idiots.
She sounds like one of those North Korean government employees that are trained to just praise their dear leader
"She must know some really dumb people, which is entirely possible."
"Norm MacDonald:  Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Donald Trump reads more than anyone she knows, confirming that Sarah Huckabee Sanders doesn't know anybody."
"He does a lot of things more than anybody. He’s the best. He’s the GOAT. The smartest. The most patriotic. The least sexist. The least racist. 

Says nobody but him."
I'm fairly confident that the majority of middle schoolers read more on average than our President...
">...saying the comment was a ""slip of the tongue"" that she made ""in the heat of the moment, meaning that it wasn’t a scripted talking point. I’m sorry I wasn’t a robot.""

I think I can speak for most Americans when I say I'd rather you just tell the truth."
Wasn't Trump bragging during campaigning first time that he didn't read? Lol
Twitter ain't literature man
she is so full of shit I'm surprised it doesn't come oozing out her ears and lying mouth.
What a lazy attempt at a lie.  Almost as lazy as her eye.
"Trump said his favorite book is The Bible. He still can't quote it accurately. 

He reads more than anybody, somehow settled on the The Bible being his favorite, and still gets it wrong. 

I'm certain that if you gave Trump the chance to spell Bible, he'd resort to ""Bibel"" and ""Bilble"" at least 50% of the time."
"She has no sense of reality. She should run for governor..

Edit: https://www.theroot.com/sarah-huckabee-sanders-i-ve-been-called-to-be-the-ne-1840029405"
They say a picture is worth a thousand words
Books on tape don’t count Sarah
Could she bit have lied about something plausible?
"It'd quite possible this is true.

She's a Huckabee. What are the chances there's a book within 7 miles of thst family?"
"To be fair, she probably only knows people who only watch Fox News and the cultist version of the Bible."
Won't it be fun when these morons elect her governor?
"""Apes don't read *philosophy*.""

""Yes they do, Otto, they just don't understand it."""
She must not know any first graders
McDonalds menus don't count.
"With that mouth, she call herself Christian. She doesn't even qualify as a self-righteous Pharisees."
The man who says he prefers having a 400 page report condensed down to 1 page reads more than anyone she knows?
"you don't ""read"" picture books Sarah"
"Measured by time, not word, sentence or concept.

For instance he got 4 Birthday cards. Read for 16 hours in all over the next 3 days. They had to keep wishing him a Happy Birthday too."
"I internally was laughing out loud after reading this for a good 10 seconds. Then I remembered that Sarah lies for money and is worst than Bagdad Bob and as long as Fox pays her she will say anything to protect Trump that she sees as having been put here by God.

She will also soon claim that Trump swims 20 miles everyday and can bench 500 pounds etc... anything to avoid talking about Alzheimer and dementia...right?"
Reads Twitter?
But she is literally a huge liar. In every sense.
"Every witting Republican is trying to reduce this country to Fox viewers:  ill-informed, fearful, and angry.

Here, Ms. Sanders is telling us that Donald Trump is a man of letters, learned, and unappreciated as such.

Trump is a victim, a great man who suffers incessant indignities. He is, in her telling, much like a man about to be lynched.

I don’t know about you, but I have lost patience with Republicans. I no longer engage them in reasonable arguments, presenting evidence that the earth is burning up or that Trump is an inveterate liar, hoping that we can come to an understanding. I find that they are lost. Some are lost to the thrall of ideology; others lost to the thrall of hate (Elizabeth Warren described Fox as “Hate for Profit”). If you have ever engaged a brother or a mom addicted to, say, heroin or meth, you’ll see ultimately that the person you used to love now has an addiction where there once was a heart, a hole where there once was a conscience, and that the addiction is more powerful than sex or hunger. Such folks cannot be reached.

I’m afraid that Republicans have unplugged the land line and have no cell phone.

And there you have Ms. Sanders, utterly detached.  In what world could Donald Trump, the Sharpie King, read more than anyone?  It is lunacy."
I wouldn’t be completely surprised if Trump spends six or seven hours a day reading shit like Buzzfeed lists from 2012 that some aide printed off.
Name one book you saw him read.
She forgot the part where the only thing he reads is Hitler speeches and Mallard Filmore
"What she meant to stay is « Reads more *slowly* than anybody I know »
That I’m willing to believe."
"In an unrelated news, Sarah H. Sanders won miss Universe 2019."
That motherfucker doesn't know what a book is!
He reads more than 10 books a day? Or does she only know a handful of people? And how does he find the time? Tweet between paragraphs? Why is his vocabulary so limited? What exactly is he reading?
"Looking at text while only having the ability to see ""Trump....Donald Trump.....Trump....President Trump"" doesn't count as reading."
"Why do we care what a lying liar has to say? 

We know she lies. She lies about obvious things. She is a lying liar."
can publications please try to pretend that she doesn't exist anymore.  please
read tweets?
I don’t know what she’s smiling about. She’s going down with him!
"She is probably right, Trump reads more than anyone **she knows**. I'll bet Trump doesn't read the bible, though."
"This may actually be true, if reading Twitter and the ticker at the bottom of Fox News count as reading."
Poor girl need to get out more; and read more.
Twitter doesn't count.
If only I cared what this wildebeest said...
If she was Pinocchio there is not enough trees in the world to grow her nose.
What he reads vs. that he reads; Two very different things.
Bernstein bear books keep him in his safe space
They are ALL scum and I only feel complete disdain towards every last one of them.
"To be fair, he really likes comic books"
She meant to say he reads for a longer period of time than anyone she knows. He's very stubborn about his illiteracy.
"To be fair, he DOES read more than anyone, but all he reads is the first page of Green Eggs and Ham, over and over, losing his place and having to start again."
So most people she knows are illiterate? We all just assumed that.
She sounds like a compulsive liar to me.
Like…tweets?
"No, it's true! She spends nearly all of her time with a cadre from rural Kentucky. Trump reads even more than they do."
Y'all gatekeeping Twitter as reading.
"For someone who lies so much, you'd think she'd be better at it."
 The pictures don’t  count Sarah.
"Listen Sara, when they ask you about me, you tell them i read more than anyone you know. ok?"
Also true. Trump kills more babies than anyone I know.
really then why is his vocabulary that of a 6th grader?
Reading Twitter isn't reading.
Staring at a news article for hours and sounding out the words is not the same as being well read.
Honestly who listens to this nitwit.
"My human nature is at such odds with these people. My instinct is to default to truth; “why would someone lie about this? They could have just as easily not said anything if the opposite is true. Why be so specific and outright lie for this guy?” 

But then I remember it’s trump and there’s no way he’s reading anything except headlines and twitter. 

But then I default back to truth... why would she make this up? Something that seems so counterintuitive. She must surely be basing it on some sliver of fact right? She doesn’t seem evil, regardless of the fact that she has been caught in lies and we largely disagree on most things. That doesn’t make her evil and so she likely doesn’t fabricate fiction from thin air for no reason, right? 

But then I remember it’s trump and there’s just no way he’s reading anything of substance. 

I’m at odds with my nature."
"In her defense, I'd bet she's probably telling the truth (everyone she knows is probably more illiterate than Trump is)."
"To be fair, she meant that he takes longer to read than anyone else she knows."
">She continued: ""He reads more than anybody I know. Every single foreign trip we actually would laugh about the fact he has boxes upon boxes, file boxes where he reads for hours. The rest of us want to take a break, we wanna sleep, the president works the entire time.""

What the fuck this does mean? He reads BOXES?"
Well if she only knows trump voters it might be true
is she still getting paid to do this?
Sure. Trump reads every issue of Boobs Quarterly.
None of these dumb fucks read confirmed. GOP is trash.
Lmao they need to ask him to tell us about the last book he read at his next presser.
He can read!?!?
"Trump wont fucking read, and barely can when he does, thats why they started giving him powerpoints with big kid pictures *but he didn't have the attention span* so they dialed it back to 3 slides, which he still couldnt handle. He is a FUCKING NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT."
Everybody she knows is illiterate.
"I mean look at the family she comes from, look at the people she surrounds herself with, reading a list of printed tweets kissing your ass may very well be more reading that anyone she knows."
If she doesn't want to be called a liar then she should stop lying. And apparently no one in the good reads or they would know how badly they are perceived. I can't name on remaining gop member that has any redeeming qualities.
">Trump “Reads More Than Anybody I Know”

Everyone Sarah kn*O*ws is an illiterate cl*O*d? I have n*O* tr*O*uble believing that."
She's counting the tweets he writes isn't she.
"I dont usually applaud a title, but, bravo"
I can believe she doesn't have many friends that can read
Reading your Twitter feed doesn’t count.
"Did none of you think that just maybe she isn't lying and that in her group of people Dogshit Donnie is the most well-read?

I mean if I compared that statement to my 11-year-old grandson's assertion that in his group of friends no one reads, it is possible that all her friends are at a grade 6 level of education.  Maybe, just maybe they all graduated from Trump University"
"Huckabee(in a parallel universe)-Mr president! I have great excerpts from the greatest authors of the century!

MR PRESIDENT- I don't know him. I've never seen.     him. I don't know who he is."
"Unless she's talking about the back of a cereal box, I'm calling bullshit on SHS."
Lying *is* her superpower.
"Lie with the dogs, your brother strangles them to death."
It’s made out of mucinex boxes because she’s that mucinex blob.
"Big bed, eh?"
OK... who's taking one for the 'team'.....

"She could have just said, “SATAN LIVES WITHIN ME! 
I LOVE LYING!!! IT FILLS THE DEPTHS OF MY DEEP DARK EMPTY SOUL!!!”"
"""Trump can spend 15 minutes hunched over a post-it note trying to figure out what a single word means."""
She lies out of 3 sides of her mouth
How low have we fallen when the act of reading is evidence of intellect for the US President?
"Achomlishments



* *Hamberders!*

* ~~reding~~"
"Another way she could’ve said this is “Trump is the only person I know who can read. It’s amazing. He can even order his own hamberders, we all look up to him.”"
"As an aside, it really bugs me that Trump and his followers always have to lie/obfuscate in superlatives. 

It can't just be that ""Trump reads a lot."" I mean, from what we know about him, that would have been a lie, but it would have been a swallowable lie that even his opponents probably wouldn't have had the energy to spend much time refuting. 

But instead Sanders has to be like ""Trump is the biggest bestest most well read and literate person i have ever known to pick up a book"" and now we all have to spend time out of our day to be like ""well no, he definitely isn't *that*."""
"""Reading is Satan's greatest trick."""
"shorter: ""I'm from Arkansas."""
"Sarah Palin reads all the newspapers, though."
Maybe he just watches Fox with the subtitles on?
Savage but fair.
It's kind of like how white nationalists don't like to be called racists.
"She wants to be able to lie all she wants, she just wants to be able to do it without anyone calling her out."
"She doesn't try to say she doesn't lie, just that she doesn't like being called a liar."
"Maybe James Comey doesn't like being called a ""lost the support of the entire FBI"". Maybe everyone that says she's a liar is just, you know, ""having a slip of the tongue because they're not robots"". No, wait, it's because it's true that she lies, my bad."
"She’s not lying, she’s “alternate truthing.”"
Thats what good Christians do
"I really think the administration’s goal is to gaslight so hard they incite violence (which is pure projection), and then crack down and declare democrats terrorists and take over the entire government."
"It's a classic Trump lie.  She could've just said ""Trump reads a lot more than people think."" That's obviously a lie too, but it's certainly less ridiculous than claiming that Donald Trump is the most well-read person you know."
"That’s what’s bonkers, she could have acted like Bush’s defenders and said he’s intelligent unlike the false narrative, but no she has to go to extremes. Why not say he’s got the highest IQ in the country while you’re at it?"
"Yeah... I mean, she could very well be telling the truth here.  It’s not like modern American conservatism is known for its intellectualism."
"All of his cronies picked up on his style of lying.  It's not a standard political lie like ""The President is working too hard to have time to read"" (laughable) or even ""He reads a lot,"" it's ""he reads more than anyone I know.""

It's gone from the typical, partisan bullshit lines of this President's shit doesn't stink all the way to ""Dear Leader doesn't even need to shit.""

It's a perfect storm of Trump's influence on his party, and Fox news working double time to cover for any and all lies any Republicans want to tell.

It's kind of a terrifying shift, and I worry that this is just the beginning."
same language trump uses on a daily basis.
Probably more like 20 cats
"Hey to be fair, barely skimming over your own tweets is more reading than my 2 hampsters do."
This gives more proof to everyone that has said Trump is semi illiterate and can't absorb much or any information from reading.
We would have been infinitely better off selecting a random American for the job. That person would at least be literate and would at least FUCKING TRY to do a good job.
"I was elected to lead, not to read."
Maybe she means he spends the most time per day reading. Sounding out the big words can take him a while and he still gets some wrong.
"Megyn Kelly asked him before the election, ""What was the last book you read?""

Trump responded, ""I read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time.""

"Just like the Palin interview with Katie Couric.

It’s all symptomatic of the extreme anti-intellectualism and inferiority complex that modern conservatism has at its core. They’re fucking morons, but instead of trying to get with the times and educate themselves, they react with hostility. It’s literally the exact thing that’s been going on in the Middle East for centuries, starting with the shortcomings of the Ottoman Empire as Europe started to progress following The Renaissance. Instead of moving towards modernity, the vast majority of the Muslim world became insular and ended up regressing as a reaction to “the west,” which ultimately lead to the genesis of extremist fundamentalism. We’re seeing the exact same shit happen with republicans in the US; they’ve been defeated pragmatically and intellectually, and they’re only concrete position to fall back on is “we’re not like the democrats, who allow ~x, y, and z~.•"
He's explicitly said to only give him one page with pictures and shit. Why lie about something that is provably wrong? That's how you know you're a compulsive liar. When you can lie about shit you know is wrong with a straight face. What a piece of trash.

How so many people have bought into a sleazy lying 1% who never worked or earn his own money, convicted blue colour working class that he understands them and will fight for them.

It’s mind boggling. You could understand it if he had some sort of charm or eloquence, that you don’t mind getting conned cos he is so charming. Dude is as dumb as a rock.

I’ll never understand it. What’s worse is the rest of world is both laughing and quite fearful where he will lead you. America has zero respect right now. You’ve become some background crazed country. When before you were the leading light.

Much like Trump, Cousin Huckabee proves that practice does not make perfect. She is one of the most inept liars in the world and only seems to get worse at it despite daily practice for years."

"They get off on how irritating it is. I think it gets her wet just knowing she is this powerful public figure that just blatantly lies to our faces. It's her petty revenge on the world. It makes her feel powerful to treat truth as a joke. It's the purest expression of it, to be able to say something so blatantly false but to watch as half the country now has to participate in this lie you've concocted. 

Sure it's all in service of Trump's ego, but shes gotten this privileged place at the right hand of Satan, finally recognized for the exceptional nature that she so clearly sees in herself, finally getting revenge on all the mean girls that shunned her and cute guys that wouldn't give her the time of day. Now the world twists itself in knots when she speaks. She's loving every minute of this. She knows it's absurd. That just makes her enjoy it more. Words are her revenge on the world, and lacking the talent and character to get that revenge by weilding truth in the service of good, she debases herself and everything around her weilding lies instead. 

That's the very essence of this administration: the revenge of the talentless, meritless and characterless in a world that had just about left them behind.

The other standard is whether you can get away with the thing the lie tries to cover up. Both Trump and Sanders excel at the second version.

In some ways the holes are a feature, since it forces their followers to find the justifications for them."

In the same post... kinda seems like a made up story to me and they changed their mind while makin it how they wanted it to turn out"
"Wait, school usually ends around 3, maybe 12 if he’s doing half day. 4 hour drive after that. Who goes to Disney to only show up at 7 pm"

My parents did this too. Said we were taking suitcases to some friends so they could borrow them.
"Bless his soul. Caring for the cat, this child deserves all the best things in life."
r/mademesmile
This is cute and not stupid at all!!
Awww that's sweet! You raised that kid right.
That’s a great egg.
No way a 6 year old is in the car for more than four hours and hasn’t question where the hell they are. He knows they’re not going home.
Aw that's just mean.  Poor little dude.
When I was like 7 my parents took me and my sister to Disney Land Paris as a surprise but told us we were going to Monkey World (an ape rescue centre/zoo thing) and I bawled my eyes out for an hour as I wouldn’t see the monkeys.
"This kid has a good heart, he doesn't belong in this sub."
The world needs more of this child.
this is actually adorable
This made me smile more than anything. Cute kid
awwww
He totally deserves this trip with a heart as sweet as that.
"My sister was similar. My parents surprised her by picking us up from elementary school early on her birthday and driving us to Disneyland. Not once during the drive did she ask where we were going. We lived literally 1 minute from the school and were in the car for an hour and a half.

We didn't have a cat for her to worry about though."
Priorities. Take care of the cat.
"The same thing happened to me when I was 12. My single mom had told us that after picking us up from school, we would be dropping one of my mom's friends off at the airport. Fast-forward to arriving at the airport and Mom has us all get out to take a group picture with her friend. That's when she spills the news, as she snaps the photo of my two younger sister's and I's surprised faces. I was so surprised, I was still in disbelief as the airplane was taking off. I remember being worried about missing homework, or not telling my friends I would be gone for a week-and-a-half. In the end it was a magical trip, I love my mom so much."
"So you picked him up at school at 3ish, then drove for 5 hours to Disneyland so he can enjoy the park for like 4 hours?"
I like how the son is concerned about the cat.
Kinda wholesome
Bam. Dad. Just rear ended car n front after hours of driving in the dark worried about cat eating Grandma. It's a small world after all
That's not stupid hahaha the old home videos of me have me worrying about things like that all the time...now I take anti-anxiety meds..................nevermind I'm sure he's just stupid.
"Such monsters! If you’re taking your kid to Disneyland as a surprise AND ON HIS BIRTHDAY, do it in the morning not after they go to school! Unless the kid likes school idk fucking shitty time I had"
Plot twist the kid drudged the cat and this is what the cat is seeing
always care more about the cats god damn
When I was a kid my family lived in California and one time my parents were driving us somewhere but didn’t say where we were going and then pulled into disney land parking lot. They were just checking the directions but my sibs and I were hype in the back seat for a minute. We ended up goin to a fookin theatre play
"I did this to my 21 year old brother. We took our two friends to the airport to see them off and at the airport said, you are coming to Vegas, all of us are, those are your clothes in that suitcase you are carrying."
Your son and a sitcom kid got swapped at the hospital.
Aww
oh no he's like me
"That's not stupid, the kid is concerned about the cat. You're stupid."
"awwww, this kid cares about this cat."
"The moral of this story is don't waste your money on Disneyland for a kid that has no comprehension of it. Take em to a new playground and tell em it's Disney and they will be all about it. My parents took me too young, I wish I remember, they are pissed I don't"
"When you make something very wholesome and compassionate turn into ""stupidity"" just because a kid was involved in the story."
"My parents did literally the exact same thing when I was in 6th grade (or before? Who knows) lmao. I remember being told to get up for school as usual, we got in the car, we drive past the school... And at that point I was just confused, wondering if we were taking a long way or something. We even got egg McMuffins for breakfast, yet I don't ever remember questioning what was going on until much later..."
Awwwwww he's a good boy!!!! So sweet.
Idk kinda smart to me about the cat part
"Responsible kid, who is feeding the cat!??"
OParefuckingstupid
"I dunno. I have a 6 year old. He would know instantly that we weren’t on our way home. 4? Yeah, we could pull this. But 6? 

Bless his heart indeed."
"My mom took me to see Hanson in 3rd grade under the guise of going to “the teacher store” (a supply store for teachers that i loved because it was like all the fun stuff in your teachers cabinet but EVERYWHERE). I was SO confused by it and it didnt really register until they came out on stage. Afterwards, i assumed we’d just go to the teacher store the following day."
The kid isn't stupid just because his parents lie to him. Honestly most of the posts in this thread are /r/stupidadults
This kid needs to buy a brain
r/kidsarefuckingadorable
"My parents did a version of this with me, on two separate occasions. The first was when I was 5 and they took me down the shore for a week (for those of you from anywhere but NJ, that's the beach) and distracted me during the drive by throwing pennies onto the floor of the backseat for me to pick up. The second time was when I was 7 and my mom let me skip school for the day and instead took me to see The Monkees live in concert. She and I used to watch and bond over the VHS tapes of the series together and it was my first ever live show. I was very concerned about whether or not she had called my teacher to arrange for me to buy lunch that day. My dad had no idea and was piiiiisssseeedddd. Top five favorite memory of mine."
"I was really scared of roller coasters when I was young, and one year my friends tricked me into going to an amusement park for a birthday party by saying we were going to laser tag. My parents were in on it. After driving for an hour I started wondering where this place was and everybody started cracking up. They forced me to ride one and I've loved them ever since."

"My parents did the exact same thing, I didn’t get excited first because I realised we had to pay to get in so just because we where there didn’t mean we where going. I actually thought they where taunting me"
"I was a counselor for an overnight camp for younger kids back in high school and we bussed the kids out to the camp. One of them asked me on the bus, ""Are we going to Azle?"" (a small town not too far out of the city we were leaving), when I told him we were going further away his eyes went wide and he said, ""Wait?! We're going to Africa?!""

No kid. No we aren't."
And he won't ever remember at 6 that he was even there.
The kid seems to be innocent.
"My parents took my little brother and I to Disneyland when we were kids. The night before we flew to LA, my parents thought it would be a great idea to watch “Alive” - a movie that had just come out in 1993 about a soccer team whose plane crashed in the Andes mountain range and the survivors had to eat the dead passengers to survive. I was 11... I didn’t sleep well that night, not due to Disney-excitement so much as my newfound crippling anxiety for our flight there."

"In 1995 my family went on vacation to San Diego. My parents told us we were also going to visit OJ Simpson's house while in California. That day--on the way to ""OJ's house""--we drove under this big arch that said ""Disneyland"" and I got so concerned. There were cars on all sides of ours, we couldn't turn around, and we were going to be forced to pay for tickets at the approaching toll plaza even though we weren't trying to go to Disneyland. I got so upset. 5 year old me was genuinely excited to go to OJ's house and didn't want to waste money on Disney tickets we weren't even going to use.

Ended up having a great day anyway."

My nephew (8) was whining about having to walk to school instead of being driven like he was at his previous school. ‘It’s not fair!’ he told his mum ‘I can’t wait until I’m a grown up so I can drive _myself_ to school!’
Lmao. I guess the kid is at least keeping track of the cat.
"One time my mom said we were driving a bit to go letter boxing in one particular area (an activity she used to drag us along on), but we actually had been driving hours to meet my friend who had moved away in the next state over as a surprise to me, I was like, wow it’s taking much longer than normal to get to this particular area"

Asking the important questions here
The cat was unavailable for comment due to alleged starvation.
"Well if they're out door cats they should be fine, the local bird population may dwindling a little. My uncle forgot to feed the cats while my parents took my little brother and I to the ocean for 3 or 4 days, and returned to see bird parts every front yard and back."
Don’t worry. The cat is happy in a farm somewhere.
"If it’s anything like my house, they just filled up a big bowl of food and big bowl of water, and the cat will be fine for as long as they are gone."
"Put out a ton of dry food, toilet lid up, clean litter box. Cat is good for a week at least."
"Careful, the neighbour may break your window to feed him."

Dang. A few (many at this point) years ago I worked as a pedicabber in a small City and at the bike shop they had 2 or 3 Jack Handy books in a small book trade library. I was really into one liners(and similar) because I was listening to a lot of Mitch Hedberg and loved the humor those books provided. Thanks for the nostalgia hit
"We took our daughter(5) and son(2) to Disneyland last spring. We stayed at a Howard Johnson hotel that had a little water park so we told our daughter that we were visiting family in the area but the hotel had a waterpark which they both love. So the first day we arrive around 1pm, get in the room which had a balcony overlooking the water area. 10ish hours of driving and both of the kids just want to go play. The next morning we wake the kids up at 7am and say ""We have a surprise for you!, we are'nt here to visit family or play at the water park, we're taking you to Disneyland!"" My daughter replies ""...but we can still play in the water area right?""."
"We used to live in Orlando and went to Disney World a TON with our 5 year old. This year we moved to California and this past weekend decided to take him to universal. Told him we were taking him to a surprise place then later we asked, do you wanna see minions?? He said ...'ehh no. Not today.' ... Husband and I looked at each other and just sort of groaned. 

He had a blast but that initial ...meh no.. made us nervous."
For real.  This kid deserves an awesome day.
/r/KidsAreFuckingWholesome
Cats are easy. You can just throw some extra food down when you are leaving for a bit.
"Upvotes here.

Our cat absolutely will lose his shit if we leave him alone for more than 10 hours."
Yeah the kid actually was thinking more at the age of 6 than irresponsible people I know. He also has empathy for his cat when he doesn’t physically see it. I think this kid has a good amount of brains and emotion sense.
Yeah this is wholesome
"Cats don't care if you're gone for two or three days. Put down some extra food and water and they're golden. They'll just sleep all day anyways.

Don't do this with a dog or kittens though. Or a kid."

"I am always overly cautious about road trips because I like to verbally checklist the house to make sure everything is in order.

"Reminds me of those Disney surprise reaction videos where they tell the kid they're going to somewhere mundane and then boom, Disney but then the kid cries because he wanted to go to the pickle farm."
"I love that nonchalant cover lol. I’m sure your kid thought that was pretty cool in hindsight. 

Reminds me of when my dad bought a newly released aerostar minivan (they were cool af then lol) & he was practically as excited as a super bowl winner saying “everyone get in, let’s go to Disneyland!” & we thought our dad was the coolest for treating a trip to Disney as easy as going to a movie. 

You have me wondering if he planned it ahead of time lol."

Aw that’s so wholesome.
the park has hotels.
He ain’t lying.
They were taking him for his bday “tomorrow”. They may have just been driving there that night so they could start he day early the next morning.
I think you're missing the point of the sub.
Six year old in car for 4+ hours and still thinks on way home. I mean... yeah not very bright.
"This is more r/kidsthatcare. No one was really stupid here. Parents decided to surprise the kid with a trip to Disney land, kid doesn't understand why it's taking so long to get home (probably distracted during the majority of the drive), kid suddenly realizes he's way far from home and is concerned about the cat. Im sure the parents already had a plan for taking care of the cart while they were gone.  This is a great way to surprise the kid without having to spend four hours in a car with an overly excited kid. Sometimes you have to trick young children to keep them calm or get them to do something healthy. This is more r/woooosh by OP than anything"
Exactly!  At 6 you know how fucking long it takes to get home.  This is such a dumbass story.

We lived in Clearwater so it wasn't a ridiculous drive but it was still pretty fucked up. They're both dead and I spelled their names wrong on each of their tombstones so really I count the whole thing as a win."
Why would you take a dead cat to Disney?
Wow this shit hit different. Been there aha
If it were that easy there would be a lot of poisoned cats in the world.
"Plot twist, I ate the cat."
"I was a kid when Jurassic Park came out. I think like 6 or 7. I saw the part where he threw the stick against the fence to see if it would shock the stick. Since nothing happened he grabbed the fence and he was fine.

So, fast forward to me spending the weekend at my uncle's farm. I come across an electric fence.

You can guess the rest. Hurt like a bitch."
https://youtu.be/VrZR2tnJtGw
My sister made do that. She would make me do things by threat like making me drink shampoo or she would dump a jug of ice cold water on me. I don't remember what the threat was this day but the result was she threatened me into touching the fence wet. She wanted to see if being wet made it worse.
That’s a tough one for a kid who loves playing in water. I would have probably also been torn at that age lol.
If only it were a real kid
My cat would miss me. Who would rub her fluffy lil tummy while I’m gone?
"My cat would almost-starve herself by eating the strict minimum if we were to be out for a few days, despite a very full food bowl.

Then she would meow and rub our legs for a few seconds when we come back, then zoom straight to her bowl, where she would gorge herself into a food coma.

Bless her kitty heart."
My cat would flip a shit and gorge herself on the food and then puke it all up.
Until one of them develops diabetes and you get to give them $3 insulin shots twice daily. Fucking Tyson.
"This is true. 
My dogs? They’ll eat literally all the food they have access to if possible

The cats I had for a while? You could leave a bunch of food out and they would eat a little bit and save the rest for later. Those fuckers know how to ration"
"Ha! Tell that to my cats who get fed exactly at 7:30 am and pm, both have a different wet food and a dose of CBD oil as well as different rooms to feed in. I wish it were as easy as slapping down some food but I have to leave my dad a page and a half long sheet of instructions when we go out of town and he’s the one taking care of them."
That sounds oddly specific.
"Hes six, not retarded."
"One of my cats gets serious separation anxiety and hisses and threatens people he otherwise knows and loves, but only when both me and my wife are gone. Otherwise he's a total social butterfly.

The other gets sulky and distant from us if we've been gone for a bit. She absolutely withholds affection based on our absence.

I'm convinced that these misconceptions are spread by people who have never actually had to care about cats."
Yeah make sure you crate train your kid before you leave for vacation.
"Yup. And smart enough to not back seat drive. He's seen how triggered the driver can be when another driver makes constructive criticism. 

I'm going to put a dollar on this wee one here to the Dr. Claw who solves our gravity problem."

"Yeah, I feel like lately there have been a lot of people who don’t understand that this sub is tongue-in-cheek coming to the defense of the kids in the comments. Their hearts are in the right place, I guess, but I’m sure they’d be relieved to know that we don’t *actually* hate kids for being stupid. We adore them for it."
Yeah he is pretty stupid. Shouldnt trust his liar parents anymore.
"Honestly, when I was a kid, we flew cross country, and before we landed, I said ""wow, I can see my preschool from here!"" Because I'd heard similar things on TV, didn't understand distance, and saw a mountain."
I didn't realize small children's perception of time was so far off
"That's a lucky break you caught there. Still that would make this post kind of dubious because I don't think they were stopping for breaks with the parent saying ""we're *alllmoooost* home, just a quick pit stop"" ""This is the last pit stop and we'll be home!"""
"Truth. There is no way a 6 year old would think a four hour car ride is “almost home”. They take that ride 5 days of the week. I can see a 3 year old, not a 6 year old. No way.

Edit: switched out honestly for truth"
Ahhhhhh that makes far more sense
"They said bday tomorrow in the post, they obv drove up the night before to start early in the morning on the rides"
"My in-laws paid for our little trio to go for two nights and three days to Disneyland. We made it there just in time to see the fireworks and then had two full days. The story seems nonsensical, but we don't have all the details."
"Sounds like someone thought this through better than I did. Let me guess, you asked your neighbors to check on the cat too?"
"Twelve year old who decides it'd be super cool to jump through a basketball hoop from his roof: stupid kid

Four year old who trusts his parents who lied to him and are laughing at him rather than letting him in on the joke: I mean also stupid I guess but this way isn't funny, mostly just sad"

Plot twist this plot doesn't exist and you're day dreaming again.
"Plot twist: you don’t even exist. You used to but that all changed back when reality was still in one piece. You float through an endless darkness, without a body, and your sanity is slowly being consumed. You desperately attempt to maintain your consciousness by reliving the memory of bringing your child. You try to recall the immense satisfaction you get from seeing your child filled with glee, excited to go to Disney land. But nothing can last forever. You eventually forget about all your memories and brought to face the eternal darkness"

It's a sacrifice but someone must face the wrath of kitty."
"Ours not only doesn't eat, he doesn't poop either if we're not home in less than 10 hours.

Poor thing has so much anxiety, he got physically ill from said anxiety last summer. He worries so much that he follows me to the bathroom to ensure I'm safe, and leans against the door once my girlfriend and I are at home so that nothing from the outside can harm us (and also to try to prevent us from leaving him and his sister alone again). The few times we've traveled away from home for a few days we usually ask my girlfriend's mom to come check on the kitty, to make sure he's fine and can do his stuff.

Makes sense to me, though. He was born in a train station and had to deal with danger, incredibly loud noises, massive amounts of people, and infrequent/contaminated food and water right; as well as losing his brother there. Once he got into a proper loving home, he refuses to leave."
Dumb kitty = cute kitty
My dog is the opposite. He will only eat when he’s hungry. So there is often food in the dish. Sometimes he kicks the dish for a refill & then doesn’t eat it - just wants to see that it is full. The vet said i need to put him on a diet (he Normally is 10-10.5 lbs but gained .8 lbs On last vet visit when i broke my leg). so now he ignores his bowl of food and looks at me impatiently because he knows i cut up veggies for him in the evenings.
"Cats are simple animals.  If they’re hungry, they’ll eat. There’s not a picky cat in the world that will allow itself to starve when food is available. You are being ridiculous"
You sound like the type of person that posts from an Instagram account while pretending to be your pet.
"My cat is the same.  A crumb in his water and there’s hell to pay.  See the bottom of the bowl and it’s the end of the world.   My dog is easy, keep his bowl full and let him out twice a day, but the cat has a page of instructions and if you don’t keep him happy and feeling safe/taken care of, the poor thing will howl until he loses his little voice.  19 years old and he’s a sweet and affectionate old man but very set in his ways and has bad separation anxiety."
This person likes to spoil their pets. Why on earth are they downvoted for that? In other contexts this comment would’ve been lauded
"Owner of 3 cats, here.  Just give'em some gross dry food, a few big ol' bowls of fresh water, and they'll be just fine.  Mittens will survive if he eats at 9 in the same room as the other cat and doesn't get his CBD oil."
He's super social. After 10 hours he shits on the floor just to assert his dominance. We get a sitter or being him with.
"Eh, I’ve had cats that were totally easy and honestly would have been fine for 2 or 3 days with just extra food and water left out.

...and I’ve had ones that would have eaten it all in 10 minutes and completely lost their shit after only a few hours of being left alone.

I think the only mistake is thinking all cats are alike. Dogs are the same way, some are fine being left alone (not for days, of course) others have extreme separation anxiety."
"My cat is fine when I first get home after a trip. ""OMG YOU'RE HOME"" *happy meows and rubs and pets* .... one hour later.... ""You're home for GOOD???? You think you can just LEAVE and COME BACK like NOTHING HAPPENED?!"" *angrily meows and comes over for pets but then leaves at the last second to show his displeasure and then ignores me while meowing loudly until he finally settles and sleeps with me in bed*.

Cats, gotta love them :) He has SUCH a personality :D"
"Or maybe all cats are different and they've never had the same experience with cats as you have.

Neither of my cats are like yours."

"i mean there are a few freaks who genuinely hate kids and are eager to rag on them for any little thing thats easily explained as ""shes four, Sydney."""
"I ain’t in that group. At all. 

I’m saying in this particular situation the kid’s behavior seems to be driven by concern for his family to the point where he’s not thinking about himself at all. 

But idgaf, it’s not a serious discussion."

He has a car seat that allows him to see out the window and he looks for familiar landmarks.

"I have nothing to add but I think you should make another edit to switch out ""truth"" for ""Church."""
Literally every time we go anywhere we leave at a specific time to be there the next day. Need to be somewhere that 6 hours away? Were leaving at midnight to be there around 7.

I'm not OP
"First off it says 6 year old. Secondly, I sure as hell knew it wasn't a 4 hour car ride home when I was 6."
"You're still missing the point of the sub. Kids are stupid, we all know it, and that's fine and cute. No one's literally calling the kid a retard. The sub name is clearly a joke. 

Now, if you're the one coming here to see kids make bad decisions and hurt themselves and call them stupid, then I think you're the only one here who's a dick."

"My dog is similar! He’s 8 pounds right now and likes to eat at very random times. Particularly right before he goes for a walk. He’ll beg us to take him out, hear the leash, then dart to his food bowl and take a few bites!

"I have a cat. He eats when he's hungry and even when he's not.

I have another cat. She only eats when she's hungry and she's not overly defensive of her food.

Meal time involves separating then until she delicately finishes her meal knowing full well the male cat scarfed his down a while ago.

Going out of town isn't as simple as throwing some food down, because we'll come back to some half eaten cat throw up and a lot more cat throw up and an underfed cat."
"One of my cats can't have food down or he overeats, basically if there's food out he will eat it, so we have to time his feedings to keep him at a healthy weight.

Also if he eats too much he would just throw it up and eat it all in a cycle until I got home"
"Yes, how dare I give my girls high quality food on a schedule (which is good and recommended for cats) and actually care about their wellbeing. They’re in perfect health and have never had any issues that many cats face from overeating or eating poor quality food. So fucking sue me. Don’t ever own cats if that’s how you treat them."
Cats can be finicky! A lot of people think they’re simple or require minimal care but honestly that just isn’t true. They need a lot of extra care if you’re really concerned about their health and wellbeing and I think that’s important in the long run. Your beautiful baby making it to 19 is a good testament to how much a difference a well balanced diet and loving care can make!
"It’s more than spoiling them; they require a high protein, high quality diet. They’re both seniors and they need the wet food for their health; cats get most of their hydration from their food so only eating dry food can cause liver and kidney problems and since they’re 13 and 14, I try to be careful with them and their health. The are incredibly healthy and happy animals and I enjoy catering to their needs and wants, including the CBD oil. They’re both fairly anxious since they’re rescues and it helps to quell that for them which is the least I can do after a fairly traumatic beginning for both of them. I can’t imagine treating them any differently. This was how I was raised to care for cats. My parents did the same with their cats and have always seen wonderful results in terms of less health problems and overall happiness so I took the same thing on when I adopted my babies. They’re my children, for all intents and purposes. I never want human kids so spending extra money on my cats is no question. You seem to be the only sympathetic person in this thread. Never imagined I would be vilified so much for, I don’t know, treating my animals well I guess?

Edit: spelling"
"I feel sorry for your cats, because it’s clear you don’t care about them. Just because you CAN do that doesn’t mean you should. My girls are perfectly happy with their feeding schedule and food and don’t face the same issues as yours will (liver problems and obesity) from poor quality food and overeating."
"Yeah, exactly. It's really weird how people attribute unique and dramatic traits to dogs but deny them to cats. They're all very unique animals.

You'd never catch me trying to lump all dogs into any kind of preset personality types."
"Real question, do you know this because you tried it right off the bat? Or did you somehow like do preliminary tests before trying to leave the freak out cat alone for a weekend?"
"Cool, that's my point, thanks for tripping over it."
And yet she's incredibly affectionate and sweet when we're around. Where does that fit in your stereotype?

And I don't mean this story in particular, it's not really stupid but it is cute and pretty harmless.  What I mean is that a lot of the posts here are less kids just being dumb (like a ten year old trying to hide in a trash can and forgetting what's generally IN a trash can) and more people lying to or tricking toddlers.  Like.  They don't know what's real yet, because they're new at this whole ""existence"" thing.  They need to be taught, because if they're not they're literally just animals. (Look up Gypsy the feral child)

A little baby not knowing how stuff works isn't stupid.  If anything, the ""stupid"" element is the kid not knowing not to trust their dickhead parents.  And... that's less funny and more sad."
"Yeah go into the comments on the toddler vids.  A lot of them don't sound like they're joking, and they do in fact call the kids retards.

Dude my friends and I kept a water moccasin in a newspaper bag until my friend's dad found out and told us what it was, jumped out of a tree that was level with the next door neighbor's roof, and tried to fly in a storm with a beach umbrella I'd detached from a table.  I got lost on my way to recess in middle school and nearly wandered off the front lawn.  I laugh at kids making dumb decisions that they know better than to make because I did the same thing and got hurt too.  That's funny, it's relatable, it's nostalgic."
"No more plot twists, this is where I want it to end."
If you take all the precautions you learn from forensic science TV shows you can go on a murder spree for 50 years and not get caught. According to those shows you can zoom in on miniscule details in a video. And they find any out of place hair laying around in an apartment.

Depends.
Ha! You think she never made me touch that thing while dry? My dad was the first one to get me to touch it dry.
That sounds like you have one regular cat and an angel.
"I have the same dynamic with my cats so I splurged on a feeder they sell on chewy.com that only opens for the cat you program it to open for. This has been a huge relief- my chubby cat cant steal his food, and my slow eater can nibble whenever he wants at his leisure."
"Don't they make feeders with timers? I sure as hell hope so because I was going to buy one before going on vacation in March. I have a cat that will eat all the food put in front of her, she'll even chew through the bag if the pantry door gets left open. She'll eat until she pukes then start eating again."
All that is being said here is that if the family went away for a couple nights and left out extra food then the cats wouldn't just starve to death because the food wasn't put out at the right time or in the right room. Your cats aren't an exception to that.
“Spoil” was the wrong word then. You like to take what most people would consider exhaustively good care of your pets. I still have no idea why the downvote brigade rolled through here.
Your cats must be fun at parties
"lol you're ridiculous.

edit: in the sense that he believes that I don't love my cats because I don't do the same thing he does, people.  He's making blind, sweeping assumptions about my cat's health because I give them food my fucking VET told me to give them, and I don't give them special oil in different rooms at veerrrryyyy specific times.  Y'all are silly."
No one cares about your cats.
Not all cats overeat
"Hah, in this case it’s an assumption...because you already know that he doesn’t stop scarfing down food until the bowl is empty and then starts begging for more not long after...and because when you come home from work/being out he’s at the door meowing angrily and annoyed.

You just kinda know with a cat like that, if you go away you gotta have someone come over or leave it with someone"

From a family of tow truck drivers. Sometimes I forget most people have an actual sleep schedule. 24/7 customer calls plus the police wait until 3A.M. or so to call for the abandoned car that's been on the side of the interstate 6 weeks. Then you get there and it's gone.
"I'm not even talking about how my parents made sure we knew their names (first and last), home address, phone number, and how to get home from school (in case we were on the wrong bus, we would be able to recognize it), by the time we started school. Some people damn near claim they were mentally disabled and grew out of it."
">and they do in fact call the kids retards.

For 1, doubt. 2, if this is true and these are the top comments, they're definitely joking. 3, if it's not top comments, then you sorted by controversial and these people are clearly missing the point of the sub, just like you.

"Honestly the best way to get away with a crime is to commit it in a place far from where you live, with no cameras or witnesses, against a person you have no connection to. Most crimes are crimes of opportunity or passion, remove those two from the equation and investigators have little to go on other than testimony and physical evidence like video or forensics. And even in the latter case, forensics is not as precise or reliable as TV shows would have you believe, many states have a huge backlog of untested forensic evidence, and they can only match your DNA against a verified sample. This is why serial killers can be so hard to catch: they kill people they don't know in places they don't go at times no one is watching."
"No, I've just seen a few movies."

I haven't got one cause it's out of my justifiable price range, but their are tons of options.

Do some research on it and see if one works best for you, they each have their own drawbacks and some smart cats are able to figure out how to get to the food container. So if you get one, I recommend you test it for a few weeks before you go on vacation"
"I watched a dog & cat who were the most intense eaters i have ever seen. They had to buy cat proof storage containers because the cat would open the others and gorge herself. They both attack their food bowls. They also had one of those puzzle toys you fill with treats, i assumed it was the dog’s but actually both of them would do the puzzle together In 15 seconds."
"Actually, they are. They can overheat easily and make themselves sick so no, I will never allow someone just throw extra dry food out for them and let them free feed. I don’t do that regularly and they don’t like diverting from their usual schedule. It’s good for them to stay on it and thankfully my parents, who are their regular pet sitters, understand that completely. I also petsit and have seen the same type of schedules for other cats so I’m not alone."
"I dunno. I guess the pervasive thought that cats are assholes and don’t require the same amount of care as a dog? I’m not sure. A lot of people I petsit for have the same type of schedule and feeding habits including my parents like I said so I’m definitely not alone here. My girls definitely appreciate the extra care and I appreciate you for getting it!

Ps I also spoil them a lot. They get premium spots for cuddles in the bed and on the couch and lots of treats and catnip! They’re my children, I love them!"

God forbid people have a decent lifestyle. What a great time to be born into
"See I don't understand how right wingers can say that Google is a ""leftist propaganda machine, and all it does is push the liberal/leftist narriative"", when its not. Its a neoliberal union/worker hating company that is merely trying to extract the most profits out of its workers without a care in the world about the effects they have on their communities"
Definitely read this as “google fires 4 workers in active labor” at first.
"I'd just like to point out that 

a) stalking calendars is kind of sketchy, but maybe if you didn't want coworkers knowing about medical and family things in your life, maybe don't label them as such on your public work calendar? 

b) constantly harassing other employees to the point they feel unsafe and ask for relocation isn't protected under the whole ""can't retaliate for employees organizing unions"". Maybe if you didn't want to get fired, you should have kept your nose down and organized instead of digging where you know you'd stir up trouble.

The leaked email is clearly just one side of the story, it's entirely possible ""leadership"" wanted some people gone and just started looking for reasons to fire them. On the other hand, that doesn't excuse the behavior. 

It's like organizing protests against the government or your local police. It's not illegal, and it's probably illegal for them to retaliate against you (in North America), but maybe you should refrain from walking menacingly towards law enforcement with a mask on and your hand inside your jacket. They can still shoot you if you make them concerned for their safety.

EDIT: For those who keep asking, read a full leaked copy of the email that was sent out to employees somewhere like https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3039327/google-fires-four-employees-including-staffer-tied-protests. What I'm saying will be a lot more clear with full context. Ignore the shitty editorialized opinions of random websites and read the original source yourself. It's only a few paragraphs."
They were fired for stalking and leaking info to nytimes

Misleading clickbait title + paywall that prevents people reading further = new journalism meta
Programmers need to unionize.
I’m genuinely surprised if google doesn’t sue NYT over that article. Publishing an article saying that that’s why they were fired is super misinformed and inaccurate.
"First and foremost, it it a corporation. No matter the slogans. No matter the mascot. No matter the celebrity spokesperson. No matter the product. No matter the service. It exists to grow and to dominate. It has the logic of a cancer cell. And made these things into ""persons"" and allowed that their money is ""speech."" These are leviathans that have grown larger and stronger than the states that allegedly regulate them."
Hey look. Another misleading title that gets wildly upvoted because people don't actually read the article.
"Let the broke right wingers get a sense of working without protections while they foam at the mouth over pro-capitalism talking points. 

Capitalism does not set a friendly, fair playing field. It's going to inevitably degenerate into the robber-baron age without oversight. Of course, firms buy oversight-free privilege by buying politicians, so we're obviously screwed either way."
"Man, sure are a lot of people in here credulously believing a story from a corporation about how they don't normally hate unions, just this one. It's like none of you have ever seen an anti-union campaign before."

"This American Life: NUMMI 
Listen to this: https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/nummi-2015
So I get that unions can protect bad workers. But the negotiation and bargaining structures in which unions operate are quite flexible. It is the extremist adversarial positioning and stances of American political and legal strategy that produces the terrible outcomes. The only alternative to class warfare is class massacre as far as I can see until management fosters common ground with labor.
“Show me a better way. I’ll be the first in line. It just better work this time.”
-Megadeath"
"Being involved in attempting to unionize does not give you a get out of jail free card.   You cant use company resources for this purpose unless they give permission. You cant do it on company time without company permission. You cant pressure people who arent interested or attempt to make a workplace hostile against un interested parties. 
  
The company doesnt have to facilitate your unionization attempts. They just cant threaten or pressure you to stop you."
"The thing about this is these employees probably will have 0 issues getting another job next door at a similar company. It’s really no skin off their back to get fired from Google for trying to organize and they know it, that’s why they did it, and that’s probably why they went about it in this sketchy way. 

Too many of us are forced into submission at our jobs because we can’t afford to go a few paychecks (or more) without a job. Submission in the form of tolerating lousy managers, not reporting harassment, not whistleblowing on controversial or illegal activities, and of course submission through not quitting when the company fails to compensate you fairly by not giving you so much as a cost of living increase for your slaving ass.

Sometimes it’s because we need employer-sponsored healthcare, but almost always it’s because we don’t have even a month’s expenses in a savings account.
 
Not everyone has the ability to stand up to corporations, but many/most of you can if you want to. Give those Black Friday deals a second thought and open a savings account instead."
Now they can create their own company and have their union
"Even if the headline wasn’t misleading, all my friends at google Snapchat me the free local craft beers and other fun stuff they do at work every week.  Definitely need a union in those conditions...or maybe just do a better job and get a raise or promotion."
"I doubt you'd get widespread support for unionization across google employees. Maybe in the lower rungs, but a lot of tech workers command insane salaries and have no interest in answering to a union when they can represent themselves just fine and easily land another job at another high paying company.

Unions make much more sense when an employer has an unfair grasp on it's employees, and I'm sure there are exceptions, but google isn't a company that can generally be called unfair. It's employees almost all could easily land on their feet elsewhere.

They have over 100k employees, 1.5% making a stink is not a big deal to them."
"Google has 100,000 workers."

"So, I'm all for unions, but I'm honestly curious what they think they're going to get from collective bargaining.  If you you work for Google you're probably in the top 1% of income, and the top .01% for working conditions. They have free, decent food, breakfast, lunch and dinner, free snacks like smoothies, a free gym, a little endless lap swimming pool, food trucks if you want something different.  You can get your hair cut, your clothes washed, and your car fixed on site. There's chartered buses so you don't have to take public transportation.  It's nuts.  And on too of that, there's a good chance you're working on something interesting instead of drudgery and have flexible work hours.

I get that every place has its problems, and housing is a big one there. But man, those are problems most people would LOVE to have. It IS a decent lifestyle. It's hard for me to get too worked up about the problems of people that are doing better in life than almost all of the people in this country."
"Cmon man be serious, it’s not as if Google has a shit ton of cash.....how dare these people ask too have a better lifestyle.."

"These folks are paid in the six and high five figure salary range, it’s not about decent lifestyle or anything, it’s about not being shit on and denigrated."

Just because things aren’t progressing as fast as we want too doesn’t mean they aren’t progressing. Plus, when would you rather be born? Before 1900 where disease and wars were rampant accords the globe, not to mention racism and sexism in full swing? What about the early 1900s, just in time to fight in world war 2 or experience the Great Depression. Mid 1900s? Then you have Vietnam to deal with, not to mention still lower qualities of medicine and technology and full-blown homophobia, with the segregation still present.

Being born from the late 1900s to today is a fucking gift. Yes certain aspects of things suck but overall we are doing miles better than we have been."
"So since nobody has pointed this out, the short version is that they're fired for repeated and obvious data security violations. They elaborate a bit later in that these 4 people sought out, gained access to a d divulged information that had no relation to their work function... Such as spying in other people's calenders to help stalk and harass those coworkers.

Being involved in setting up a union doesn't (and shouldn't) shield you from getting fired for stalking and harassing coworkers."
Why do you think people keep committing suicide?
Let’s just kill our selves on their wall
"In all fairness, the 1950's-2008 were the exceptions to the rule. The vast majority of human civilization has been based largely on human suffering.

What is sad is that the baby boomers couldn't stop being greedy long enough to provide a better life for their children. Even though, I suppose that is what the ultra wealthy did by lobbying intensely to work on removing taxing inheritance and in effect, creating ultra wealthy dynasties that will last for the foreseeable future. God help us all if the cure to aging is ever found."

Absolutely, we have a chance to make the world better"
I remember the days where people said Google's was the best they have slides and beanbags. Guess the novelty wore off.
"I don’t know what type of workers were organizing here but google software devs get paid 300,000 dollars a year and along with ridiculous amenities and benefits. They certainly had a ,decent lifestyle’"
"If you stripped out all the technology, it's not unlike it was 100 years ago. Heading into the roaring 20's in the gilded age with the worst wealth disparity in history. Pretty soon, everything will blow up and ruin the lives of everyone except the top 1% who worked tirelessly to create this situation.

The big difference now vs then is right now the planet is also dying, which is also being caused largely by those in power with the wealth."
"You’re pretty spoiled if you live in America today and don’t think this is a great time to be born into. This company offers average salaries of 3-figures and so many perks like free food, counseling, flexible hours, etc. I understand being annoyed they’re anti-union, but give me a break with “how terrible it is to be alive today”. It’s far better than its been in the past where these billion dollar corporations did nothing to promote healthy work habits and work culture. Let alone a “fun” culture. We live in a time in America where a majority of households under the poverty line have smartphones and computers. It’s a great time to be born into. Not perfect, but at minimum it’s as good as its ever been."
"That's ""Google forbid"". Can't be too careful not to let your social score drop too low with the almighty watching."
"I just read that and replaced ""Google"" with ""Walmart""."
The strangest thing to me is that a lot of far right people that I have met have been in favor of unions. I worked in this union once and almost every person that worked there was as much of a die hard Trump supporter as you can possibly be. Kind of goes against the grain of the whole “unions are leftist and evil” stance the GOP always tries to take. Everyone wants a fair work environment.
"People who label someone ""left"" or ""right"" like they label sports teams home and away are dumb. Things are always shades of grey."
"> See I don't understand how right wingers can say that Google is a ""leftist propaganda machine, and all it does is push the liberal/leftist narriative""

Over the last several decades, what used to be known as ""the left"" became one half of a political and economic consensus primarily concerned with social justice. For whatever reason economic justice and suffrage stopped being a priority. Since Carter/Reagan in America and Thatcher/Crowder in the UK, a broad political consensus of Neo-liberal monetarism became the norm for both sides of the former left-right spectrum. 

As such, the economic status quo became invisible and taken as more or less a law of nature. Meanwhile the economic left became invisible or the target of massive propaganda. 

So to your question, google is not perceived as having conservative economic politics because their politics are taken literally as business as usual. They are the only economic politics people know about and so do not perceive it on the left-right spectrum."

"Its largely a left leaning corporation (I know people who have friends who've worked there + every company in silicon valley pretty much is). Tbs, left doesn't mean not seeking higher profits. 

Parties are groups of colalitions with selective beliefs. The Latinx side of the Dems may be very pro workers rights and immigration, but not strongly pro lgbtq+ or pro secularism, same goes for Google. They're left as far as it benefits the corporate machine's bottom line."

Fixed. 

I don't know why people are up in arms that Google is trying to do today what it's been doing all along. It's a business, and the point of business is to make a profit. All else be damned. 

This is a good time to remember that there are alternatives out there, and if you find Google distasteful, things like Duck Duck Go provide very good search results. Just about everything else Google does has a worthwhile competitor out there. It might not all integrate as nicely as with Google, but then again, many of those options let you keep control of your data a lot more than Google."
Because they virtue signal leftists causes like a mother fucker.
"Well it helps people access information, and everyone knows knowledge is leftist."
"Never heard of an oppressive leftist organization?  

Soviet Russia and Peoples republic of China would like a word.  

The two are not mutually exclusive."
"Neoliberals are notorious for using wokeness to score political points as ""left"" and confuse the politically uneducated like Trump supporters into advertising them as leftist or make ""moderate"" Democrats think they're on their side. 

When push comes to shove like in this case they expose themselves for the rightwing snakes they really are but that gets ignored by the aforementioned geniuses."
"Things aren't black and white.

The people creating the machine learning training sets at Google tend to be liberal so they introduce bias into their work. This affects the search results.

The people running the business care about money and don't really give a shit about anything as long as it makes money.

So right wingers complain about Google being left wing because the search results are biased, and left wingers complain about Google being right wing because they think only right wingers exploit workers."
How does the content they tend to censor have anything to do with how they treat unions in their company? Two completely separate issues
"The billionaires and the bottom line will always be right leaning mindsets even if those people have a lot of left leaning ideals elsewhere.

Sure you guys can have free healthcare, if the government pays for it and it doesn’t increase our tax burden is a typical mindset of a “left leaning” company like google who only really takes good care for their higher level employees while they mass fire janitors who eat the food that’ll spoil instead of throwing it out."
"Well, they pretty much have two different sides to them. The business side is ruthless and capitalist, but their values side has a definite left wing agenda. The latter may be because they think it's good business, but they definitely have employees who hold those values."
It’s also a corporate enterprise so it’s super hard to be both
*Fiscally conservative*
"yo I gotta disagree with you, I know a lot of people who work at google and all of them enjoy their jobs, do meaningful work, are paid well, and generally enjoy their lives. I think it’s easier to hate from the outside..."
They can be both.
"I've posted a similar comment recently but I'll say it again. Rightist views have a connotation with racism and other non progressive ideals due to the nature of our world's history. It's bad for PR. So they to distance themselves from it by appeasing to leftist ideals. How many ads pre civil rights movement  featured a non whites? Aunt Jemima? Aunt Jemima existed to serve white people. Were they pushing right wing conservative agenda? No, they didn't want to offend the majority of their customers, like I said, bad for PR. Do you think the old as fuck, white CEOs that make up the majority of CEOs are liberals that wish to push their agendas? I don't think so. They're the kind to lock their car doors if they see a black man not wearing a suit approach them. To quote RATM, those people ain't seen a black man since their grandparents bought one. Companies are not your friends, they are not your enemies. Their core agenda is not left nor right but ""fantastic monies and where to find them"". 

Same around the world. Ads are catered to the highest common factor with expendable money."

"As a former union organizer who both worked for a union and tried to unionize my own work place, I know first hand that they will make shit up to fire you and then sidestep labor board rulings right to the edge of the line of breaking the law. They did make a mistake in making themselves known. When doing something like this, you can never trust anyone because people do cut backdoor deals to rat organizers out or gather Intel from them."
Fiancé works at google and got the email about this today. You’re more on point than you know. There was some seriously sketchy shit that these people were up to. Funny to see how everyone jumps all over google for firing people for literally stalking their coworkers.
"If you browse some of their Twitter's they were very anti Google long before the firing. Not pro-union, but anti-place-that-employed-them. Don't imagine any company would tolerate that for long."
I was part of a successful unionization effort in the entertainment industry a couple years ago. The one thing we were told across the board by the union and organizers was to NEVER discuss it on the clock. Even during lunch was dicey. We were told to never make it easy for the company to fire us because they likely already knew what we were up to and paying attention.
What a time to be alive where journalists pounce on juicy stories without really vetting them. It's so tiring to perpetually hear that everything isn't actually the way that it see presented.

I just read the article, where does it say anything about this?

Also, what do you make of Google hiring a firm that has helped other companies fight unionization?"
a) day 1 at Google I was told to set my personal calendar to show/hide availability only. Pretty sure it's in the training
"You mean? :

Pretty clearly reads to me as, ""We promise we fired them for a good reason. We'll let you just as soon as we figure out what that reason was.""

Seriously, how do you figure out whether something is against your code of conduct _after_ you fire someone for it?"

"None of the people who were fired are accused of leaking anything. They were fired for viewing documents that were later leaked. But the writing is phrased to imply that these people leaked information, without stating it (because they didn't).

If a worker tracked other employees like that and WASN'T fire the employees should be angry."
"[A former Google employee on Twitter](https://twitter.com/antumbral/status/1199105971517181952) says that Google has never had strict control on data, and that it looks like they've introduced strict *policies* without actually bothering to try and restrict what people look at, or explaining their policies well."
Google is lying.
Labor organizing is when people are working to start a union.  Collective bargaining agreements.
"That's not a new invention. You have to buy a newspaper to read the articles but the headline is always going to try and be eye catching, as you can read it without buying the paper."

 right below the headline. NYT vs Sullivan establishes incredibly high bar to sue news organizations, and the NYT has some of the best 1st amendment lawyers in the world."
"Google doesn't really sue like at all, it's one of the main values of the company is that litigation should not be used because it is so often abused. One of the positive qualities of Google that is often skipped over."
You know this for sure?
"It is, but under their own ""words"", they're fired because they've tried to obtain informations that wasn't within their scope of duty."
"If there is a x% chance a person will leak internal information, then at a certain employee count there will be enough leakers to periodically fire."
"Googlers make six figures and have career prospects to reach half million+ per year incomes in around a decade of employment. 99% don’t give a shit about worker unions, lol"
California has some pretty forgiving laws encouraging that. You \*do\* get to organize on company time. What you don't get to do is dox people who disagree with you.
Many of these people are hired out of college and expect their employer to behave similarly and take care of them like a university.

> Google Fires 4 Workers Active in Labor Organizing

> A company memo said they had been dismissed “for clear and repeated violations of our data security policies.”

> The firing of four employees on Monday is expected to worsen tensions between Google’s management and a contingent of vocal workers.

> SAN FRANCISCO — Google on Monday fired four employees who had been active in labor organizing at the company, according to a memo that was seen by The New York Times.

> The memo, sent by Google’s security and investigations team, told employees that the company had dismissed four employees “for clear and repeated violations of our data security policies.” Jenn Kaiser, a Google spokeswoman, confirmed the firings but declined to elaborate.

> The dismissals are expected to exacerbate rocky relations between Google’s management and a vocal contingent of workers who have protested the company’s handling of sexual harassment, its treatment of contract employees, and its work with the Defense Department, federal border agencies and the Chinese government.

> Tensions have increased as Google has cracked down on what had long been a freewheeling work culture that encouraged employees to speak out. Google recently canceled a regular series of companywide meetings that allowed workers to pose questions to senior executives and began working with a consulting firm that has helped companies quell unionization efforts.

> The changes are a remarkable turn for a company that has been considered a standard for the modern workplace. Google introduced many of the office perks that are now common across Silicon Valley, and its embrace of transparent relations between workers and management has influenced a generation of start-ups.

> This month, Google placed two employees, Laurence Berland and Rebecca Rivers, on administrative leave, saying they had gotten into confidential documents that were not relevant to their work. They were among the four workers who were fired, according to two people familiar with the dismissals.

> Ms. Rivers confirmed her firing on Twitter on Monday. The identities of the other two employees were not clear Monday evening.

> Mr. Berland and Ms. Rivers could not be reached for comment. The memo announcing the firings was first reported by Bloomberg News.

> On Friday, Mr. Berland and Ms. Rivers spoke about their suspensions at a rally attended by more than 100 Google workers outside the company’s San Francisco offices. Both said that they had raised objections internally over Google’s work with Customs and Border Protection but that they had not gotten access to documents they were not authorized to view.

> In the memo, Google said the fired employees had repeatedly searched for, looked through and distributed information “outside the scope of their jobs.” One of the workers set up notifications to receive emails detailing the work and whereabouts of other employees without their knowledge or consent, the memo said.

> “This is not how Google’s open culture works or was ever intended to work,” the memo said.

> When asked last week by The Times, Google could not point to a specific rule that forbade setting up these notifications but said it was investigating to determine if this and other behavior violated the company’s code of conduct.

> The Tech Workers Coalition, an advocacy group, said on Twitter on Monday that the four employees had been fired for “organizing at work” and encouraged workers at Google to “speak out against this draconian act.”

> “This is meant to scare workers, don’t let it,” the tweet said.

> Veena Dubal, an associate professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, said, “It does seem like this termination was in direct response to their organizing.”

> She added, “I am skeptical that this was about how safe other people felt, and more about how effective these people were in the workplace in terms of organizing their co-workers.”

> In August, nearly 1,500 Google workers signed a petition asking the company not to pursue a contract with Customs and Border Protection, which they said was complicit in “human rights abuses.” In September, Google hired a former member of the Department of Homeland Security staff, Miles Taylor, a move that provoked a backlash from workers who objected to the Trump administration’s family separation policy. Google deleted questions about Mr. Taylor’s employment from internal systems, BuzzFeed News reported.

> At the rally on Friday, Ms. Rivers said Google security staff had interrogated her about her involvement in the petition. Mr. Berland said he had also worked on the petition and raised questions about the company’s decision to hire Mr. Taylor.

> “If we can’t speak up about these issues that concern us about our work,” Mr. Berland said, “how can we ever hold ourselves and each other to the high standard that we need and the world deserves? Silence and secrecy are not the way for us to come together to solve problems.”

> Google employees at the rally said they were protesting the suspensions of Mr. Berland and Ms. Rivers and demanded that they be returned to work.

> “Google has suspended them from their jobs and interrogated them for speaking out,” said Stephanie Parker, a Google worker who spoke at the demonstration. “We are here today to show them our support and to demand that Google bring them back to work immediately."""

"In order for these kind of disruptive situations to not happen, where employees have to do covert operations in order to organize and companies try to hunt them down before they do it, the state should just force that if a company has more than x employees they should start automatically unionizing, have a representative etc.  Whether they will use to the full extent the negotiation tools they are provided by this framework or not it's their choice but at least we bypass this cat and mouse transition. my 2 cents..."
"For a lot of the people organizing, a North Star is making sure that everyone who works on Google's campus is treated well and compensated fairly. That includes temps, contractors and vendors who work in the kitchens, maintain the buildings, and even ""knowledge workers"" who, for example, worked as the voice of the Google Assistant (ie they wrote the copy / made sure it was a consistent style).

Many of these people have very few guarantees about their continued employment and aren't treated particularly well.

If you're wondering ""what could programmers possibly gain?"" perhaps you should consider that many of them are trying to use their voices and leverage to help their colleagues who are not in the 90th percentile income bracket.

"Most of the concerns I've seen fall into varying categories of corporate governance and transparency.

"> what they think they're going to get from collective bargaining

- You can insist that no member of the union be forced to violate certain ethical principles. Like working with ICE.
- Transparency on things like hiring bias, pay bands.
- Can insist on certain best practices regarding sexism, other forms of bias.
- [Weingarten Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weingarten_Rights)
- Prevent insane crunch
- Not everyone in tech is as well-paid as engineers. There are even people at Google who are underpaid. 
- Arguably, even Google's engineers can make a strong case for higher pay. _Their_ labor makes the damn place run, after all."
"Probably more say in the direction the company takes.

Typically that direction is set through interaction between the execs and the board.  So possibly they want labor to have a seat at that table—“No, we won’t help the stockholders make money by contributing to human rights abuses.”"
"I worked at a great place with great perks, and we organized because a woman was let go for taking time off for an emergency hysterectomy and there was no collective to back her up when the bosses said - hey, that's none of your business how we treat workers with their individual issues. So we made it a collective issue. Gym memberships are dope - but a person getting canned for having an unforeseen life crisis? That may hit us all and it's nice to have someone have your back. The bosses sure won't."
"What can you get with collective bargaining? More money. None of that ""free"" shit is free. It's in lieu of market based or better wages, something the Silicon Valley got caught colluding over wage fixing."
"There’s a lot of people who work at Google who are not being paid well, or any have promise or secure work, and do not receive the same benefits and perks as full-time direct hire Google employees."
"As someone that's worked both the big fancy tech job and the $8 an hour endless grind... If they could pay engineers $8 an hour and get away with it, they would.

Right now the pay and benefits are pretty good. And as time goes on, and more things get automated, and more people enter the workforce... it'll just keep getting worse and worse, until everyone is cursing themselves for thinking unions weren't necessary back when the pay was good and they still had solid benefits.

Anyone that works for a living and can't make millions of dollars a year by sitting on their ass (or, in the case of large companies, hundreds of billions) is proletariat. In the end we all get fucked by capitalism, and while it certainly sucks a lot worse to be stuck in an $8 an hour job as opposed to a $175k/year job, it's important to remember what the real problem is here, and use whatever power we have at our disposal to stop it."

Unions can go beyond just improving your own working conditions. Obvious the government can't get Google to act ethically but it's possible that the Google employees themselves could force the company's hand if they decided to strike
"Think about pro athletes. They’re in the top brackets for income, some live in low-cost cities. But they all form unions to negotiate together. Most physicians are also highly paid, but they get together to form physician groups, letting them negotiate rates with insurance companies together. 

I don’t see why a google employee wouldn’t have any cause to want to negotiate terms of employment - to have a contract that says what the employer can and can’t do."
"Exactly, it is completely unnecessary. Google has an issue where they have employees who they hire straight from college, and they expect their employer to be an extension of that experience. Unions are also a hot topic right now, and I don't understand what these people think they will gain by unionizing. If anything they will lose money from Union dues."
"Not everyone @ Google is a high payed programmer, it's a big corporation."
"Shorter hours, paid overtime, well paid temps, call center staff that are treated & paid well etc etc etc etc

You're thinking of the extreme creme-de-la-creme. Plenty of Google employees are not well paid developers.

And even then ... collective bargaining strengthens you against future crises."
"They still live in an ""at will employment"" state so doing things like fighting for the rights of LGBT or black and brown people won't get you fired by the bigoted CEO. That means they could also force out bigots the CEO approves of (no more James Demores telling women they that are inferior humans). That endures they keep their privledges in case of ""budget cuts"".

"I wouldn’t mind big companies making 20 vacation days a year standard, like they have in the EU. It’s especially punishing because so many companies tie vacation accrual to years of service, but the best way to improve your income and opportunity is changing jobs frequently. So you’re stuck either having chronically low vacation days or lower pay. Again, that’s relative to EU countries, not US countries.

Weekends weren’t a thing until workers unions made them happen."
"Just because you have benefits it doesn't mean that these can't be taken away at any moment just because a quarterly earnings report was a bit worse than expected and some executives needed a bit of cash to make the charts look pointier.

Ultimately workers have a responsibility to stand up for themselves and the only way they can do that is collectively, the individual has no chance against a corporation, unless they have some crazy leverage."
Plenty of well paid professions benefit from unions. See actors and football players.
"Imagine working there and your fellow employee who just got done playing ping pong making 100k a year driving an Audi and getting full benefits, in the same sentence can complain about how underpaid and overworked they are. Like wut."
"People get mad at Walmart and McDonalds and those for abusing their workforce but if you examine SEC statements. Google, Facebook and Apple operate on profit margins between 20 and 40% of revenue, while Walmart and McDonalds operate on margins of 2 to 4% of revenue.

Basically, the most underpaid people in our xountry are actually the well paid staffers at big tech. They produce hundreds of thousands more in wealth than they are paid, but because they are paid ""well"" its ignored.

Heres the math. Fb had a profit of 7b and has 40,000 employees. They can afford to pay EVERY SINGLE ONE of them another 175k a year without even losing any money, they only lose profit. That means from the janitor to the sales lead to the lunch counter work. All of them could get another 175k before it would affect their bottom line. Its fucking gross."

I don't think that many of them see with clear eyes just the kind of threat that they resemble, but they do recognize them as a threat. The problem with a lot of right wing politics is that they don't seek to get rid of corporate power, but to seize a seat at the table. Capitalism attempts to subsume all critiques into itself, even fascism. And it works. And then you'll probably be no better off as fascist dictators rarely grant access to centralized capital. They throw a few bones, but they're more likely to buy people off with violence instead.

"Obviously I don't have every single detail on this event, but I will at least say that whoever was calendar stalking and accessing documents they shouldn't and breaking the Data Security Policy (supposedly all 4 on breaking the DSP), Google has solid 100% proof of it. They wouldn't make claims like that without the data to back it, they do have the data to back claims like that, and the number of people required to forge logs for something like this would be too high to hope that no one in the chain would have a conscience and rat out everyone else.

Now might these rules being enforced selectively against individuals involved in union talks? I have no idea. It's entirely possible, but like you (and I) said, you want to keep your nose clean if you're starting union talks at work. Stop stalking HR reps, stop harassing people, stop digging through docs trying to find dirt on Google for anti-union stuff, just get on with your legal unionization talks."

"Go find an article with the full leaked email, e.g. https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3039327/google-fires-four-employees-including-staffer-tied-protests

I haven't actually researched into that particular allegation yet, but I wouldn't doubt it. Google is a big company, they have something like 180,000 ""extended workers"" who are the ones mostly trying to unionize I believe (not actual employees for the most part). If they are trying to beat back talks about unions I wouldn't be overly surprised, but I would be surprised if they do anything illegal on the way. They employ more lawyers than most companies have employees total.

Which is why I say that the people organizing the union stuff need to be a tiny bit smarter. If you're organizing a union or talks about unions, don't go stalking HR employees and digging into things a mere month after the announcements about how Google fires people for digging into need-to-know docs. The right to unionize doesn't mean you can't be fired, it just means you can't be fired for the unionizing part."
It’s says about it in the sourced official memo sent out by Google to it’s workforce
This is not the norm in the part of Google I work in.
"Go read one of the articles that leaks the whole email, e.g. https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3039327/google-fires-four-employees-including-staffer-tied-protests

Your quote is from the article, not from the email that Google ""leadership"" sent out. You're quoting third hand shit-grade reporting. Try quoting the real email.

> Today we’ve dismissed four employees for clear and repeated violations of our data security policies."
"It's a work calendar, it's open to the company by default. You can hide it, but then people don't know when they can schedule you for meetings. You can also mark it private and literally every meeting shows up as ""busy"" and no details. You can also refrain from writing ""picking up my children from X school"" on your internally open calendar. Clearly the users upset about calendar stalking didn't do any of those."
"So what is your proposal to the problem then? If you were a manager or HR rep and you had several employees concerned for their safety because another employee is stalking them and following them, and you've asked the offending employee to stop and they won't. How do you suggest Google should have dealt with it?"
Stating facts isn’t boot licking.
Since when does overtly acknowledging the abuse of absolute power REMOTELY smell like boot licking?
Absolute gagging.
"IKR, are they sure they are from Reddit?"
So what happened to the real leakers?
"This is so oft repeated, and it's just not wholly true.

From your link (emphasis mine):

>Between 21 April and 4 May 2018, Google removed the motto from the preface, leaving a mention in the final line: ""And remember… **don't be evil**, and if you see something that you think isn't right - speak up!

See? Still there."
"It never had any meaning. It was so open-ended and interpretive.

Most people would define evil as ""Intentional malice done to others with the sole purpose of self gratification"".

Thus Google could argue that paying employees less serves top keep the company competitive and thus innovate for society as a whole, or that firing employees for breaking rules is not malicious at all."
I wonder why.
"I'm as pro union as anyone (I'm a  left wing Canadian who thinks the Liberals are too ""big business""), but union forming 101 is that you don't let management know you're trying to organize. 

Whether your employer is a tech giant like Google or a mom and pop ice cream shop, if they catch you trying to organize, you're fired."
I’d be curious to know what this actually means. Like my calendar is accessible to anyone in my company and you could subscribe to it or receive email digests of what’s on it. That doesn’t mean people using it are “stalking “ me.
Could you ***imagine*** if Google allowed people to *track data points* on their *own employees*?  I'm sure they'd ***never*** support such a thing.
"Apparently that employee set up calendar notifications on other people's calendars. I didn't even know you could do that. And given the number of people who put things like doctors' appointments on their work calendar I can see why that's a problem.

---
^(Putting your doctor appointment on your work calendar is just a bad idea all around, anyone at the company can see it. Block it off as ""out of office"" and keep the details on your personal calendar.)"
"Yeah, my company doesn't have massive restrictions on data either, because they expect the employees to have the ethical aptitude not to go around spreading it."
"This is misleading and changed a few months ago.  All temps and contractors lost access to everything in drive by default and needed to be given access to specific docs, bugs, etc.

Also the majority of product and user data has always been locked into restricted databases that have very high bars for access."
"Okay, so is it then a way to gain influence in the company from the bottom up?"
"Yup. Clear violations of company policy, making coworkers feel unsafe to the point they want to relocate. There’s no concrete evidence that they were fired because of their involvement in union organizing, so the headline and article are straight up defamation"
what is that
Google makes the app and Amazon owns the server space.
"Google and Apple delist the app, automatically know who downloaded it, and sell the information to companies so that disciplinary action can be doled out at their discretion. 

Chessmate, commie."
"Dude! Yes! I’ve been trying different fields of work lately, and every job I get is obviously underpaid and the employees are exploited. I always want to bring up unionizing to my coworkers but I know I’ll get canned for it AND the coworkers won’t even know ass from mouth about what I’m talking about. They’ll also be too afraid of getting canned, themselves, and when they do, ILL be the one to blame. Goddamn I love this country."
"Vote for Sanders; he's probably the only candidate who supports card check unionization efforts. 50%+1 sign the authorization to unionize, boom, union formed and collective bargaining begins."
"That would be pretty useful. Especially since bosses can't tell which users signed up. On the other hand, you couldn't keep a running total of how many users have signed up to encourage other users, because if you could then the bosses at, say, Walmart could shut down the entire store, which is something that they have been known to do before."
"A telecom company that I won’t name used to let their employees vote to unionize. Between the time the people filed and the time they went before a Judge, often delayed once or twice just because, the Company would fire some people and promote others to first level management (without having anyone to actually manage - just a little more pay, for more hours expected to work, and a useless title). Then when they finally appeared before a judge to confirm the vote, the count was completely off, so they would have to start again, meeting after hours, convincing people to vote yes, etc. Their delaying tactics cost the employee years and dozens of votes. Thankfully, they finally won and the retail shops are Union now. 

Another funny anecdote. We struck in front of one of the stores. I spoke with one of the recently promoted. He seemed to think the promotion would lead him to a job in Corporate even though the Company NEVER promoted from within and he didn’t even have any kind of degree. He used to get overtime. (I’m making up the next numbers because it’s been a while and I truly forgot) He used to make an extra $100 a week working an 8 hours of overtime. He  chose to be guaranteed an extra $50 but was now expected to work an extra 2 hours a night and one weekend. 

“So they expect you to work an additional 18 hours for less pay”.

“But I can choose not to work the extra time but they expect it. I want the next promotion so I will put the time in”

“So the expect more hours for less pay”

“Yeah, but it’s my choice and I’m management now!”

You can’t fix stupid."
walmart workers had one and walmart would *strongly* discourage employees use it
I think this is a great idea. I'm actually a web developer and wouldn't mind giving a little advice if you're looking to run with this.
"It's something I was thinking of making a prototype of after I finish my Master's. Definitely an interesting idea, but I'd want to do it right and not jeopardize my future career in tech... Cuz I see that happening. I have many ideas."
Wouldn't it also have to make sure that everyone is still employed there?
"This except someone actually does it

E: because I know someone is gonna come tell me to do it, I'll bench the idea until I know how to program but if you can,  far dumber and less useful shit has been kickstarted for more money before."
Pretty sure you disappear
"Honestly, that sounds like a pretty easy thing to code."
That's actually brillant. Im gonna fwd thus to my union rep
"Had anybody said ""blockchain"" yet? Because, blockchain."
Glassdoor.com?
"That is pretty fucking brilliant actually. As others pointed out you'd need a strategy to handle delisting so building it as a PWA with a SPA front and have your ""app"" in the stores just be a frame for it. That way you can also use the webpage and have the same UX/UI.  I'd also be super paranoid as a user so you'd need a very secure backend. I'd even argue that you'd ideally use a blockchain where you could pledge your personal information such that the system can determine if they check out (say by verifying company email in a secure and stealthy fashion, or by you scanning in a copy of your last paycheck) and then the actual data like name etc. is locked away and only unlocked if you reach mass. 

Next problem would be to reach mass at a place of employment. It's like Fight Club. Loose lips sink ships and all that. So how would you anonymously spread the word? Maybe the app could send an email to every address it can crawl up for your workplace? Such that there is no trace back to you. Or you could print a QR code to place in spots like toilets/coat room/office supply room etc. Or maybe a robocaller going through all extensions? Though I guess that one would place the app maker in a pickle... 

Spreading the word seems like the hardest problem, because the app doesn't do much unless you can reach mass and at the same time trying to spread word will get you fired (at the types of companies where this app is needed). Maybe the user has to supply a list of emails to other employees or even instructions on how to export the addressbook, and then you can send that in anonymously and then in a randomized and staggered fashion fairly discreet emails go out to everybody. Probably you should be instructed to remove certain types of roles from the list, like say CEO, C-level execs and a few HR types or any known anti-union crusaders."
How would one go about getting the total number of people at the company?
"Holyshit yeah, steamline the unionization process so that employers can even realize it's happening before it's too late."
"Well, isn't that a LPT now?"
"Tethics, even."
Ding ding ding. Thats the true reason. These companies try to divide their employees so they wont fight for each other.
You seem to know a bit about what's going on. Could you point me to where I could read more?
Hahahahaahahhahaahahha
"This, definitely. Face recognition for government surveillance, working with ICE, sexual harassment in the company. These have all been addressed by large groups within the big tech companies.

Even if not successful, a union can give people cover for at least speaking out."
STAY IN YOUR LANE PLEASANT LEST I TAKETH THEE FREE HAIRCUTS
"I know 3 people who work for Google, and 3 more who used to. If you're putting in ridiculous hours there and it isn't crunch time before a big deadline, your boss will tell you to dial it back. Burnout is a much bigger concern than getting work done faster."
"Google is WIDELY regarded as the absolute softest place to work in the Bay Area.  Amazon and Apple employees grind longer hours for lower salaries and far fewer benefits + amenities (granted, still pretty top-notch).  Slack, Facebook and Uber employees spend more time in the office, too. Startups are another level entirely.     


I'm friends with 10+ googlers or ex-googlers at this point, and outside of X and some arms of Alphabet, all of them have fantastic compensation, great work life balance and generally don't work more than 10-7 or 9-6.  There are bursts of longer hours ahead of deadlines / during triage, but it's just not a common thing.    


I'm all for unions and union protections, but I'm definitely not as sympathetic in a case like this, especially if the behavior was disruptive to their teams / projects."
"Which is also hilarious because between all of the companies that pay $300k - $800k a year (amazon, Facebook, microsoft, Netflix, apple, uber, etc), google is seen as the best work life balance by far."
"But let’s be real here, if you can get a job at google, you can find a job elsewhere."
"Google is a very chill, low stress, 40 hour a week employer."
Well most everyone else is pressured into never leaving work cause they’ll be homeless if they miss like 2 paychecks. I know which set of problems I would choose
Can't they just leave then? They clearly have the skill to get jobs almost anywhere they want in their field. I'm just surprised they'd want to fight to work in a place that they feel doesn't value them. It's a lot different than people with little means that are effectively stuck in their job with few prospects for improvement.
Googlers I know work 40-45 hours peer week. Less or the same as most professionals.
That's really not always true though
"Correct me if I'm wrong,  but weren't the people who were organizing the highly paid ones?"
"Contractors wouldn't be eligible for a Google union, they would need to form some kind of Union or guild separately."
Those subcontractors aren't the people this whole thing is about.
Unions don’t help contractors
"Damn right. We all need unions. Whether you're making $7.50 or $750. Unionize and protect what you have or unionize and increase your pay. Don't wait for Bezos to grace is with his ""charity"" of a pennies."
"Maybe not, but definitely compared to some of the other tech companies out west like Uber and Amazon, you're definitely chilling at Google."
I worked at google in Austin for 2 years. Which part do you not believe lol
Been to one of Googles satellite offices.  It's real.
Also even if you are making top 1% income as a Google programmer you are still being fleeced and should be making probably 50%-100 more Google makes a lot of profit that could be more reasonably shared with each worker
"I don't think it necessarily follows that there must be something there, at least in the scheme of things. Like I said above, I'm legitimately curious about what their demands might be other than ""have a union""."
Sounds like a good opportunity to set up shell companies that hire contractors to do the work instead of having actual employees.
"Yeah, I worked for a tech startup which grew around 10x in 2 years, but my salary only increased by maybe 40%, and i had to fucking get in a shouting match with the founders to land it. 

They were going to offer me a paltry 10% raise for my efforts even though my workload effectively increased by around 3-5x depending on the day. The founders themselves were at this point buying flashy cars and mini mansions."
"This logic is ridiculous, these are some of the most highly paid employees in the world. Most engineers between 300k-500k a year. Margins are so high for tech companies because they don't need a giant workforce like Walmart or Boeing, and employees are paid heavily in equity. The revenue argument is also totally irrelevant, Walmart still makes billions in profit, as their revenue is 10x or more higher than Facebook. If anything companies like Walmart could learn from tech about how to take care of their employees and make them part owners."
"It's insane how many people in this thread, in a technology sub, are out of touch with what a lottery ticket it is to work at these companies. It's what many tech workers aspire to and work towards."
"Somebody else in the comments dug up some of the fired people's social media, and they've apparently made it very clear for years that they detest Google, so it's not like they were missing reasons to get rid of them even if we ignore the union stuff.

It's just as likely that the firing was completely legit or even overdue, but the union saw a bunch of potential martyrs and went for it - after all they're the source on it being related in the first place."
"You could try to do so and many have tried and failed.  All they do shrug it off, shut down the Walmart that is going to be unionized stating that it wasn't doing well in sales, then set up shop down the road about 10 minutes away.

Apparently, when America spends 10 cents of every consumer dollar, Walmart can do shutter a location without a second though because they have enough in cash reserves and have enough clout to strong arm any politician."
"Lmao I'm just imagining you typing ""unionize Walmart"" has set off their webcrawling Matrix sentinels and they're searching through your personal information that they bought from Google"
"They are just going to get rid of all the redundant workers, like the greeters"
"Most people on r/Walmart even knows what the difference between a craft union and a industrial union even is, so hopes aren’t high"
Not unless you do the same with Amazon. Otherwise you'll destroy Wal-Mart.
also wayyyyy back in the day being pro organizing waa considered communist
"> but you'll see more public support for unions on the left because it's a step closer to workers owning the means and all that

No, it's because workers controlling their own lives is good in and of itself."
It's not party registration. First-past-the-post voting will always have a stable equilibrium in two-party. Why has America only ever had short-lived three-party moments in history? Why do other countries regularly have multi-party coalition governments? FPP voting. Not registration.
Which is created by FPTP voting.
It's literally because of where people sat during the National Assembly during the French Revolution if memory serves.
"You're pretty much just getting meme replies, so I'll try and actually give you an answer. In the US, politics is hyper polarized because of first past the post forces there to be two major parties. You're either a Democrat, a Republican, or you're wasting your vote; that's just all there is to it.

In that environment, people kind of have to choose which party more closely represents the issues they care about. If you're a Democrat that likes guns or a Republican that is ok with abortion, you're going to have to deal with it. That is part of why people care so much about their party instead of just each individual issue.

As far as the labeling goes, thank the media. Both sides of the media are balls deep in demonizing the opposing party as much as possible. Facts don't matter anymore, it's all about making the other guys look bad so your base can get their torches and pitchforks."
My opinion is this is a issue fundamentally caused by the two party system in which is the fault of the first-past-the-post system. Its also generally easier to understand surface level problems when you have an antagonist to deal with.
You need numbers to get anything done in politics. Political parties provide you the numbers.
Labeling is useful for demonizing one specific set of people for a complex issue.
"I feel like your complaint is actually so broad that it is really an attack on the concept of *nouns*. 

""Why do people create names to describe things!"""
People who put labels have no personality and there only identity are those labels. That's why you see all that shit on Twitter profiles.
">scientifically

I felt """"""euphoric"""""" reading your comment."
Scientifically sound approach?! What are ya some kinda commie liberal!? /s
It's a good tool that has been utilised by political parties to draw peoples attention to the labels themselves instead of the quality and content of policies.
"The labeling is useful. If you'd vote for what's called (and actually supports) Labor in most countries, you're ""leftist"", even if you're not really leftist. If you'd vote for tax breaks to the wealthy, you're righty, and most righties are reactionary/conservative, so it's a very useful description of political stances."
"The whole thing seems to be competing beliefs about how much government there should be. Some people in the US tend to be suspicious of additional government and want to leave things to the market, while some are suspicious of business and want to use the government as a bulwark against it. It's not really precisely that simple, but if someone favors using government they're ""left"" and if they want less government they're ""right."" The system gets entrenched because people don't tend to change their views on that easily. If someone thinks government is evil today, they'll think it's evil on voting day, and they'll vote for the party who tends to say that we need less government. If they think businesses are evil and government is the only thing protecting them, they definitely won't vote the same as that other guy. 

The labels are there because we need a way to describe things, and the specific labels in use right now reflect the public's feelings toward government. The US has a tendency toward asking the question ""how much should government do?"" and the parties reflect that question, which is one that naturally has a line and two ends."
"you're right, but i think the issue is labeling a company like google as 'pro democrat' or 'pro republican' when really they're just going to act in whatever is in THEIR best interest."
"But the voter certainly can be in the middle. I am what most would consider “right-wing”, but I absolutely acknowledge climate change, I just value other issues more. I don’t have to agree with everything the party stands for. I just have to agree with more of the right’s stances than the left’s."
The far right had accepted climate changed dude. It’s pretty scary cause their solution is genocide.
"And that's totally fine. I'm trying to say that generalization is a bad way of solving issues. In the end, it doesn't matter if you are left or right, white or black, gay or straight. If people are to solve problems, they need to actually tackle the issue instead of blaming the opposition as the reasons issues around the world aren't solved."
"How many of those are on a similar scale to Google? Not a rhetorical question, I would like to know."
"Oh sure! But if you can point to a sizable cohort (let's just say 10 or 20 or so) of companies or corporations that are in the top... oh, say, 1000 best performing* companies, that also aren't union busting, please come forward with that list. That's keeping you to only about 1 or 2 percent of the best and brightest out there. Not a high bar, I'm sure you'll agree. 

Until then, we can agree that Google is being evil for the moment. As are most, if not all, other large corporations. 

*Let's use Standard and Poor's or some other well regarded listing. Just to keep things on a steady keel."
You have a suitable alternate...?
"I'd don't have all of the details either. I just remain skeptical. Also, it would take one person to forge those logs, but I doubt they would do that. What is more likely is that they're exaggerating what happened and applying rules they usually don't enforce. That is also common and actionable on the part of the labor board. I agree with the rest of what you said."
And it's easy to pay (a few) people in the company to spread these rumors.
Let me introduce you to an app called Blind. There’s far more than a few bitter people at even mid sized companies.
"300,000 people working at Google, there's more than just a few sadly. Same with the leakers and abusing managers. Everyone has them, but Google has them at scale :/. Luckily they also have great and friendly and upstanding people at scale too :)"
"I mean, if you want to unionize.. you kinda need to be unhappy with where your employer is going.

That's the very point of unions: To improve pay and working conditions."
"You are missing the point. They were dozing coworkers to the leftist mob, so it’s ok /s"
"Yeah, usually only the execs and product council's do set cals to private.  It's just annoying for your co-workers because there's so much random shit that aren't meetings anyways."
"So for example, if I was looking at the calendar of a cute coworker I liked, and had a notification every time she had an afternoon meeting in a room near me, that would be ok? It’s not like I ever intend to act on it, right? I don’t want to talk to her, I just think it would be nice if I saw her by chance. If she didn’t want me to know where she was at any point in the day she should set her calendar to private. Who cares if her teammates sometimes need to see her calendar meetings, if she really didn’t want me to track her calendar she could turn it off. 

Can you understand how fucking creepy these people were being, now?"
"Fire the people who are being stalked, they are obviously the root cause of this issue /s"

'This month, Google placed two employees, Laurence Berland and Rebecca Rivers, on administrative leave, saying they had gotten into confidential documents that were not relevant to their work. They were among the four workers who were fired, according to two people familiar with the dismissals.'

For those two at least it doesn't sound like a digest of your calendar as that's not confidential. Other parts of the article make it sound like signing up for notifications isn't specifically against the rules."
"Whattaboutism.  Assuming there were no argument against your point, how would that make what this guy was doing ok?"
"I read another article that made it slightly more clear. But only slightly.

“We want to be clear that none of these individuals were fired for simply looking at documents or calendars during the ordinary course of their work. To the contrary, our thorough investigation found the individuals were involved in systematic searches for other employees’ materials and work."
"There's a difference between data (which is highly, highly, highly protected) and documents, which historically weren't controlled. Think the difference between ""my emails"" and ""how gmail works"". The second is generally public, and has always been treated as open internally, but is now being considered retroactively to have been more secret."
"It's a way for the workers to get more bargaining power, so they can negotiate better pay and benefits. The idea is that if a single worker says ""pay me more or I'll resign,"" the company can easily replace them, so they won't care about the worker's threat. However, if all the employees at once say ""pay us more or we'll all walk out,"" then the company can't easily replace them, so the company is more likely to give in to the workers' demands. This group of employees all saying the same thing is called a union, and the process of creating a union is called labour organising. Companies don't like unions, but firing or punishing a worker for founding of joining one is illegal in the US."
"""Google Fires 4 Workers Active in Labor Organizing""

Care to point out which part of this isn't objectively factually true? They were fired and they were active in labor organizing. Those are 2 separate statements and are without a doubt true. You can quibble with the way they're implying the two are connected but that's not defamation."

Tragedy of the commons may be at play here.  Maybe the guy who sucks up to management by throwing his coworkers under the bus does get rewarded and promoted for it.

"Yep, Sanders is the man. It’s time organized labor pushes back on big businesses and let them know they can’t just have there way."

We need to make sure people register as Democrat and vote in the PRIMARY! We must get everyone to vote in the primary. Do not wait until the General election.
"You'd have to validate the users actually worked where they worked though.   Otherwise management spams it with a hundred fake ""yes"" votes, and then the 4 people that weren't bots show up to the union celebration meeting on monday outnumbered by management and get canned.

"You don't know how many users are signed up until it's enough for a definite yes vote. That's why you put in the number of people at the company. You're not actually organizing yet, you're just invisibly raising your hand. Untill there are enough hands, then you get a notification, it's visible."
Walmart shutting down is ok too as their stores kill local businesses and thus competition among employers.  So kill them off until its more profitable to accept unions.
Is it a mall booth?
"""hey, do you have the union app on your phone?""

""No"""
Walmart has actually closed down entire stores after their workers unionized.

It's a classic union busting strategy.

This is stupid. As long as there is someone else taking the vast majority of the wealth your labor generates, you have every reason to form a union."
"Just because others are worse, doesn't mean the conditions are good. I don't work there or know anyone who does, but I do know that these perks are a cheaper incentive to keep people at work than higher pay. Also not sure that these perks apply to the hordes of contractors."

Edit: I'm assuming a top level programmer at google makes about as much as a radiologist doctor, so let's say $300,000. 

A poor person is making like $8000 a year.  That's about 40 years of working at $8000. If we're being generous, let's say they work $10/hr full time.  That's about 20,000 a year.  That's still fifteen years of pay."
"God forbid that people work together to make for better work environments for everyone and not just themselves. Look, even if these fellows found a new job, the same working conditioners are still there for the next slob who takes his place. It would be much better if person A worked for a better place so person B wouldn't have to fight for it. Better yet if A and B worked together for a better work environment even if they don't even work there!"
No. Google is holding a gun to their head. There are no other opportunities in silicon valley for these workers.
"Honestly, those are probably the best ones to do it. If you are a highly paid, extremely competent worker who cannot be let go easily, then a group of such workers would by default have the most bargaining power, and least likely for being illegally fired or other such shenanigans. Not to mention that such a group, already highly competant,with united ideals could very easily start up a competing service which is more pro union, with much less of the start up costs of other sectors of the economy."
"True, but a lot of these full time employees see the trend of the “gig economy” creeping further up the food chain. If they unionized, you can be certain that in bargaining they’d demand that the company stop using so many temps, many of whom work right alongside full timers, and instead hire workers directly to full time roles. In fact, the hiring of temps to full time roles was one of the main demands of the GM workers in their recent strike."
The idea is they will be included in negotiations and that terrifies these companies. They try and divide employees so they wont fight for each other.
If the union got off the ground they would be in short order. That's why it's being stopped.
Yeah and watch their quality sink. Go back to your hole scab
We all need unions. There's nothing that can keep them from losing those benefits if a Bezos type decides he needs money. Organize before they take it.
"I don't see anyone here saying it's a bad situation to be in? But putting down people who want to form a union just because they already make higher than average isn't exactly productive, it's ludicrous and anti-worker. Unions protect employees from wrongful termination, from being taken advantage of, from having their wages stagnate.

Tech workers make good money now because that's how the market is, but there's no reason to believe it will always be this way. The best time to form a union is when the workers are in demand and they have leverage."

This is also the general feeling I got from this thread."
"This is why it is important to have the government crack down on employers doing that shit. Walmart gets away with it now because every administration since Reagan has been handling corporations with kid gloves, they just need to get their shit kicked in once and the workers would take care of the rest."
"Imagine having so much money to blow that you can shut down any one of your stores at any cost, instead of just fucking paying your workers"
Sounds like China but on a more localized scale.
"The trick is to do a multi-store deployment. If you can lock down a Union for (City name) Walmart Employees, I find it hard to believe they aren't going to shutter 5+ at the same time - especially when that would create a blackhole in a significant area of town for their competition to sweep up."

"I will agree up to the point of 1 person forging logs. Luckily Google's security isn't quite that bullshit. 2 highly skilled people in collaboration could in theory, and they would have to have Owners privileges on every project you want to forge logs for, or else 1 more engineer colluding from each product. And literally anything you did to forge said logs would be easy to trace back to you and show it was faked if anyone looked into it."
"Yes, I do understand, and if someone caught you and that woman complained about it making her uncomfortable at work, you would be asked to stop. And if you didn't, you'd be fired. This is literally what happened here.

You literally can't make a system that cannot be abused. I don't need calendar to stare over the cubicle walls at a cute coworker. Are you saying that cubicle walls that I can look over are a serious privacy flaw? I could be creepy and stare at her all day. Hell, I could take photos on my smartphone of her all day and it would be creepy. Should Google ban cellphones in the office? Have metal detectors to prevent you bringing one to desk areas?

No, because that would be stupid. Instead companies have policies where technical enforcements would be a significant impediment to business operation. Policies like no staring at coworkers and making them uncomfortable. Policies like no taking photos in the building. You violate policies and get caught, you get fired."
You can share your calendar with specific people without making it public though
Still no one wants to actually answer the question. So your answer is allow employees to harass other employees until they quit while you spend the next year or two trying to improve overall company health internally? Just look the other way?

"That's true. They'd also have to validate people's real life identities, but in America there are no official unique identifiers so the only things available are either hugely compromising (SSN, drivers license number, etc) or easily faked (phone number, email address, etc)."
Doesn't matter.  Walmart still closes the store.
"I agree, it's a great thing when a Walmart closes down... Except if you worked at that Walmart and you're now unemployed."
"Unions aren't a zero sum game.  There isn't a maximum amount aklowed.  Actors, athletes, writers, etc have unions, and they make bank.  Tech workers make no overtime and do not own the rights to anything they create at work.  You create the next big thing at Google and Google makes billions, what do you get? The same salary as everyone else?  There's a reason even high paying jobs have unions"
Why not all of them? There should be no bar of entry for unionizing.
"I don't know about warehouse workers, but janitors probably don't even work for google. There was a case a while back about some ""Google cafeteria workers"" being unable to afford homes anywhere near the Google offices... except they weren't employed by google, but some food service company that google contracted. Google has no control over their pay; the same likely goes for the janitors at their offices, they probably work for a custodial company contracted to google rather than google directly.

While google has some physical products, I doubt they have much warehouse space and likely don't own or directly employ warehouse employees, either. Amazon is the only ""big"" tech firm that would do so, because so much more of their income is based on retailing physical goods."
It doesn’t apply to the contractors. And there are several labels of employees with different levels of perks.
Not around here. Minimum wage is 15. And 8000 dollars is like 4 months rent. You would not live here if you made even quadruple that amount.
"I get you’re trying to make the math fit your original bill and all. While some people might make 8k a year, that’s basically the other 1%."
"I mean, first of all I dunno where you get the $8000 number from but if you're working full time on minimum wage in the US that comes out to about $15k a year so that's about 20 years of work. 

SF and Seattle have minimum wages around twice the federal minimum at ~$15 which is about $30k a year so that's 10 years of work.

I think there's a reasonable argument to be made that a ""top level programmer"" contributes more to the economy in 1 year than most minimum wage jobs do in 10. Certainly if we're talking about scarcity a true ""top level"" programmer is at least 10x rarer than someone who can do a minimum wage job."
"Yeah, also just wait until the new line of tech grads come out over the next 5 years. You can expect a fun race to the bottom for all those brilliant engineers."

By European standards those two are hard right, and even in the US, Sanders and Warren together currently have about 40% support in the Democratic primary - that's almost half the party backing candidates that are *extremely clearly significantly to the left of the corporate party leadership.* If you want to label the most right wing, anti-worker segments of the Democratic party left wing... What does that make the other half of the party?"

"What I’m saying is the responsibility should not be on the party being stalked to change their behavior so that the stalker can’t track them.

I don’t think the people being tracked nor Google should make changes. 

Your original post made it seem like you were suggesting the people being tracked should have taken steps to specifically prevent people from tracking their activity, but this post seems to be coming from the same point I was making that this was basically a few people behaving improperly at work and being justifiably fired for it."
The onus shouldn’t be on the individual in this case to privatize everything. They should be able to trust that their colleagues aren’t going to creep their calendars and share their schedule with others like that.
"What evidence do you have to that effect?

Unless you, like me, work at Google, your only source of information is a press release from the company who fired them that refuses to actually claim that they leaked anything. The strongest claims they make are (unsubstantiated) claims of ""repeated violations of data security policies"". 

How is that circumstantial evidence that they leaked things? The group with the most to gain from claiming they leaked anything (Google) isn't willing to actually state that outright.

As for other circumstantial evidence: these people are/were highly visible organizers. They're not dumb, and you don't have to be that smart to recognize that breaking company policy by leaking confidential documents is a sure way to be fired. Its much more effective to not do that."

"> I’m not a lawyer so I can’t say from a legal standpoint.

Metal workers were very active in creating strong unions. In France the « métallurgie » work convention is one of the best for work conditions. For historical reasons many IT companies were built around that work convention and it's very comfortable working in that field.
"Thats both the biggest hurdle and the biggest advantage to unionising. They can close *a* store, but they can't close *all* stores. And they know it."
"In the case of Walmart, you might need the majority of every store within the state/region/country."
"I fail to see a downside, if they close the store the local retail demand will be filled other ways, and there is a limit to how often they can repeat that stunt without causing themselves harm or the government to intervene, or they could just close stores until they're out of business...

Unions work, that's why oligarchs are so afraid of them.  They can try to enforce consequences but the whole point of organizing is that they can't punish everyone, and they can't stay in business while still closing every store that looks like it might unionize. 

Especially if you organize at scale.  This wouldn't be one store, theoretically you could do it to hundreds, thousands at once.  It's impossible to just ignore that many people."
Yeah sucks short term but its better for those workers in the long run to have more more employment options.  And it's better for the workers to be at Walmart if it theoretically is unionized.
Ownership of IP is an entirely different issue. You get a salary to create for that company. You use all their capital to make that IP. If you wanna drum up your own ideas and keep it for yourself you’re gonna have to make a startup out of it and see how far it gets you.
"But would you have been able to create that next big thing without the support structure and existing technologies and processes that Google provides? If you can, then you should set out on your own to do it.

Also, if you really created the next big thing, you'd most likely become the product manager of that product. Which would help you climb very quickly. The company is also incentivized to retain you so you don't take that information to a competitor. It's not exactly ""same salary as everyone else""."

Again as someone who deals with privacy and security concerns all day long it's very easy for me to say  ""well why the hell would you share that in the first place??"" when I live a paranoid lifestyle. I do believe that people over-share and don't realize the consequences of that until they feel violated and suddenly realize how much they over-share, and it always boggles my mind that people don't think twice before making any information available, even internal to a company. Google has more employees than my hometown has people. Before posting anything on a work calendar at Google I would ask myself if I would likewise post it in the town square for all to read."
Well yeah of course but the issue mentioned in this thread is about an apparent flaw in Google calendar

If they close the store than fine.  Helps local businesses whom are also employers.  As long as they aren't a local monopoly on retail and closing the store effectively destroys the town.

"I definitely agree that if they make it through the job hunt then they're better off in the long run. And I would choose unionized Walmart over non-unionized any day. But on the wages that Walmart pays, the initial job hunt gives you a matter of weeks before you start sinking in bills and debt."

But I'm not going to violate my ethical codes and get myself fired to satiate a random internet person who I doubt would believe me anyway (you've already proven that you are willing to bias towards the uncorroborated and unsubstantiated statement from Google against the unsubstantiated but highly corroborated accounts of multiple Google employees)."

The residents are old people that grew up there, there children now grown and either stayed or returned after military service. Kids of course exist and attend school though class size drops 10% a decade.

Nothing will bring back vitality to the town.

WalMart is 30 miles away. Closing that WalMart will do nothing more than make Amazon busier and have people drive further if can drive as are old and poor. Local merchants are not going to appear in a shrinking town.

Why not leave as I did? Perhaps because have been in the town from birth, are helping a bit with parents and grandparents. Your deceased relatives including your daughter are buried there in the local cemetery. Your skill set is dated or minimal. Your church is there where you volunteer to teach at Sunday school. You help with the kid sport leagues.

I feel guilty that I left. That I never returned to help fight to revitalize the town. To help make the town more tolerant. That my elderly parents will die soon while I am 1000+ miles away as I was as my grandparents died.

WalMart at this point is a positive for those isolated small towns that were in a protracted decline well before the first day WalMart opened."
"\> I get the sense that he's not asking for leaked documents, he's asking how you can be so certain that the fired employees did not leak the documents

Among other things, because the group with the most to gain from claiming they leaked documents (Google) hasn't actually stated this, only written statements that imply it. There's some other evidence to back this up that isn't public, but suffice to say that I am highly confident that Google either doesn't believe, or cannot prove, that these people leaked anything to the public. It fired them anyway.

Given the lack of any hard evidence, and my knowledge of the goals of the people who were fired (all are intelligent people, who know that leaking something is the quickest way to getting fired) wasn't to explicitly hurt Google, or to get themselves fired, but to push back against company actions, getting removed wouldn't help, and leaking the stuff that they've been not-actually-accused of leaking wouldn't actually help them towards their goals.

Obviously I can't prove a negative, but that's mostly irrelevant. Just because I can't produce people who actually leaked the documents doesn't mean these people did, especially because, again, and I can't stress this enough: Google hasn't actually accused these people of leaking anything to the public, its only used sneaky wording to imply linguistically that they were involved in leaks, without any actual evidence tying them to the leaks."

Imagine standing there watching a train come at you at this slow of a speed and still getting hit by it. Everyday it amazes me as to how we as humans managed to get this far up the evolutionary ladder. I’m surprised some other species hasn’t just hunted us to extinction already like the dodo.

How has r/Bitchimatrain not been linked
Who else thought it was gonna be the lady in white who got hit?
She probably just lost her train of thought which is why she just stood there.
CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKER!!!
I've been in situations like this and I instinctually pull the person out of danger. Most commonly this is grabbing the distracted walker as he's about to walk into traffic etc. It doesn't make sense that nobody just grabbed her and yanked her arm a bit.
Darwinism at it's finest.
They moved.
My only semi-logical guess is perspective distortion (assuming she using the viewfinder of a camera).

the people driving the train, who right at that moment is worried that they might have killed someone, and is later having to do meetings with managers and reports and all of that shit.

The managers who have to report higher up about what happened.

All the people waiting for the shipments aboard that train that will now be delayed by who knows how much, and everyone in the chain after that.

Everyone waiting for something on trains that was supposed to come after this train but now has a delay because this trian is stopped.

And the people around the woman who again had a moment where they might have though they just saw someone die."
"...is she retarded?

What could she possibly have expected to happen?"
Did the person survive the accident?  It looked like it may have fatal.

Oh looong Johnson
The real question is: how much did she sue for?
I like trains.
They ran a train on her
Girl was like: why train didnt stop?!?!?!?!
"What I hate about this is that the train is sounding its horn as long as possible. This means “watch out, I am a train, get the fuck out of the way”. The people probably thought; “cool, fun train noises”. The conductor is trying his best not to accidentally kill someone and people are just thinking “train horn, classic!”"
is the train okay?
I am struggling so hard with day to day life right now people are so dumb I just want to die sometimes.
Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes
Some people are willing to die for a pic.
This is in Napa right?
This is the way.

It’s obvious she couldn’t back away fast. She wasn’t trained for it
How do such people manage to live for so long
Is anyone remebering the oh long johnson scene from south park?
It's insane. I work on a steam railway and they don't need to be going fast to kill you. The sheer mass of them moving at walking pace is enough to kill the shit out of you

So bitch probably thought that since she wasn’t on the track she would get hit like the train doesn’t stick out wider than the track at all? Also lost  perspective.
But....but why??
she's either dead or has multiple broken bones for sure.
For a moment I thought the front of the train said ‘meme’
And one of this year’s Darwin Awards goes to...
Did her face explode?
To be fair he did cause the train to stop
You shall be moved
That could have gone a ***lot*** worse than it did. She's lucky she fell the direction that she did and not the alternative.
That will buff out really easily...just need a new coat of paints after scrubbing off those white fleck and red splatter.
Imagine being so dense in the head to stand that close to a moving train.
He clearly never played GTA5. Trains are unstoppable
"My first thought was, ""Maybe she's deaf"", but she's *looking at it*.

I understand stupidity, but she's not reacting at all.  This means she's sitting there and no survival instinct in her brain acknowledges a) the loud noise, b)the large fucking train making the noise, and c) the fact that she's standing on train tracks"
Fine them to hell too while we're at it
"I've done some stupid things in my life, but I'm not stupid enough to stand near the rails when a train is coming..."
What’s funny about this is this is the El Chepe train which goes through the middle of a mountain range in Mexico.  She’s probably hundreds of miles from a proper hospital.
"So it seems that the inertia of a train is like those silver gravity balls. It transfers that forward energy. Amazing how she went down.

Also makes sense how when people touch these things going by their upper torsos spin like a top."
why are they taking selfies with a train? what kind of 5th world country is there where trains are a novelty?

"This is why cattle catchers were invented. Wouldn't have dented the train, if there was one."
Imagine how the train conductor was probably thankful more people didn't get hit in this situation...

Imagine thinking the rails determine to maximum width of a 10+ ton moving metal dick
"Now instead of calling an ambulance,  everyone should gather around her and take selfies."
What a dumbass
Okay she wasn’t smart but what about all of the people around her who can tell she is not going to move out of the way of the train and LET HER get hit
That's why locomotives have had cow-catchers for over 200 years.
Amazing it actually stopped.
This is just..... too ignorant to sympathize with
Was she trying to stare down the train or something?
She was lucky it is just knock on the way.
"""why didn't he turn right?"" - too stupid to move person."
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, human stupidity always makes me laugh"
i heard a “toink” on that one
Most intelligent species
"No idea what was going through her mind as she watched that train hurtling towards her.

I do however know what went through her mind when it hit her. 

The train."
My man Chuck D approves of this one.
Oooooo loooong johnson !
"A friend of mine did something along those lines back in high school, still remember going down there later and the little streaks of stuff that remained on the tracks after they cleaned most of him up. RIP big guy, you were a ""funny guy"" one too many times (think he was 15). Don't fuck with trains, they'll win."
Thomas thought briefly about the brakes before forgetting such a stupid idea
That'll derail her plans for the rest of the day
"Typical Karen. 

I bet she got straight back up and demanded to speak to the fat controller immediately."

Is that in Gleispark?
Natural selection works this way.

ooh long johnson

"It stopped.  
Whatchu talkin bout unstoppable"

"People seriously underestimate the momentum involved in one of these collisions.

Yes the train is not moving all that fast, if a car hit you at that speed you’d probably be ok.  However these things weigh so much more than a car and have none of those nice crumple zones to mitigate the impact.

You take all of it."
natural selection
Wow. The level of stupidity here is on an epic proportion. She was even looking right at the train.
"[This is the rail line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrocarril_Chihuahua_al_Pac%C3%ADfico) so yes, Mexico.

I can’t find anything about a person getting struck though."
Great brakes on that train though
She tought She was bigger and stronger. Guess what- She learned the Hard way that She isnt
Can I say its oddly satisfying to watch stupid people get bitten by karma
"I’m pretty sure I know the answer to this but, am I a bad person for wishing the stupidest of our species died in situations like these? Survival of the Fittest and all that."
I’ve hit people before who thought being outside the rail was a safe place for them to stand.
And bystanders urged to help her.
Could the driver have been any clearer?
"Poor train driver, his blood pressure went from 0-109. The trauma of hitting someone is only worsened when people seem to be trying to jump under the fuckin train."
She's going straight to the manager
Some people grow up in homes with no consequences.
Seems to me she could be typing on her phone
She made it stop tho.. But probably cause the driver thought he killed her
Damn! Was the train okay?
I was waiting for the guard to kick her in the head. Haven't seen that video reposted for a while now.
Have that person arrested
Oh long Johnson! Oh long Johnson!
I hope she died
[PAIN TRAIN IS COMIN'!!!](https://i.imgur.com/tDbvVIA.gif)
Multi track driftu can't save you now

Front of train hits a caboose.
She got yeeted outta there
That was immensely satisfying to watch.
"Hey look, it's Spider-Man"
"Back then, stupid people were weeded out by nature thus reducing the chances of passing down their 2 digit IQ Gene. Now... Thanks to modern medicine, technology and regulation, stupid people are not dying as fast and often as nature intended thus are able to pass down their idiotic genes.

This women is but one of many examples of modern day idiots"
I feel like I need sound.
That's the second time they ran a train run into her.
"She might have been on the right track thinking she could get out of the way in the last moments, but that train of thought didn't account for those handles and her plan was derailed."
"She was so focused at filming the front of the train, she didn't realize the train stuck out so far."
Probably so dumb that she thought the fact she was not on the tracks would be okay. To dumb to realize otherwise even when at was close enough to kiss.
Except it did stop?
It stopped like 5 seconds after tho
"Well, it has stopped as we can see"
She stopped it all right
"She was wondering why the train appeared to be getting bigger and bigger, and then it hit her"
"there is something about trains that sucks the brains out of people

that's why  simple stop sign works at an intersection with a busy highway but warning signs, pavement markings, cross bucks, lights, bells, gates and a blaring horn are not enough to get drivers to stop at railroad crossings"
Actually it looks like the train is slowing down right after the impact fairly quickly.
We need people to test if unknown fruits and plants are edible and taste good.
"The modern world with all its safety regulations and lack of natural predators is pretty much the reason why shit like this happens. 

In a tribal environment your unaware idiots would be watched over by aware idiots. The strength of community would be far greater if you live in small villages where everyone knows everyone"
"Really? There are 6 billion people on earth. Think of the dumbest thing you ever did. Do you think that was anywhere near one of the dumbest things that 6 billion other people did? Probably not. Your dumbest thing is probable near the middle of the pack. You’d probably have to do something 100 times as dumb to be anywhere near the top 10% of dumbest thing.

Now put a camera in everyone’s hand. Some of that bottom 10% is bound to be caught and it’s going to go viral because it’s friggin’ dumb as hell. 

TL;DR: we’re seeing the dumbest of the dumb out of 6 billion people. They don’t represent all of humanity."
I too wonder why we weren’t hunted to extinction by the dodo
This is what happens when you put warning stickers on EVERYTHING......no warning sticker so she thought she was good. Darwinism at it's slowest I guess.
It's cuz natural selection is not really a thing with humans when compared to other species.
Ones like this don't.
"Easy, we have top minds who create buffers for the slower minded population."
I'm TRYING to hunt as fast as I can! You guys keep breeding like...like humans!
You forget the quote “only the strong survived” enough humans have died doing stupid things for us to get where we are. Now science has improved so much these people who would of died in the wild are secure now
"Enough of us are smart enough, meaning at least common sense level, to survive and replenish the losses."
Other animals get hit by vehicles way more than humans do.
There was this old Mr. Show sketch where they advertise some mock Faces of Death type video and one of the titles was something like “Train Hits Dumbass”.  It’s been like 20 years and I still think about that title every time I hear about someone getting hit by a train.
Dodos didn't hunt humans.
That's because the humans that are actually capable of surviving are carrying the rest.
She felt that ladder.
"She was too fat to step back. In fact, she was so fat she'd had to run a 100m race to not get hit."
We are at  point in time where the smart and strong protect the dumb and weak. 200 years ago if stood in front of a carriage and got trampled youd be fucked but now with the smart doctors and technology youd be saved.
Society allows for this kind of stupidity to survive.  If we were still hunter gatherers this woman would have died very young.
"Well you see there are rich successful people and there are poor unsuccessful people. 

The rich successful people are the type of person not to be hit by a train. 

They also get the poor unsuccessful people to do things for them. This allows for great achievements for human kind."
^^^*Every ^^^day
Dumb humans should technically die out and not be able to procreate according to Darwinism but we keep them alive with social aid and putting up with stupidity
Evolution is funny in that we don't all need to be successful.
Lmao.. ur so right..some people I have come across in life I don’t even know how they have made it out of bed each day let alone live on there own SMH..
"What if we’re right in the middle of an evolutionary leap? Maybe all this screen time and tech automation is making us dumber and eventually we become our own version of the dodo and the AI we develop ultimately surpasses us. Next thing you know, “Boom!” — we’re the ones in the zoo."
"That's one human that has been protected, fed, and cared for by the herd.... There's no need for a survival instinct."
"I think, in evolutionary terms, that's exactly why we came so far. We just left those genes behind most of the time."
Well that’s exactly how we managed to evolve. By the dumb ones dying.
That's because those dummies used to die to natural selection but now that ain't a factor anymore and they're free to reproduce and spread their stupidity throughout many generations to come.
When a train comes I back away cuz im afraid of rocks maybe flying my way.
I feel like we have to be missing part of this story. Like she didn't see it or some sort of explanation that makes sense
"To be fair, the dodo is only a small bird compared to humans and would not have been strong enough to kill a human 1 on 1."
Depth perspective in one eye would probably do it ?
"We are edging into the era where many full on adults were raised on tablets, youtube, and netflix, and have hardly ever stepped outside except to go to school and participate in sports."
"> it amazes me as to how we as humans managed to get this far up the evolutionary ladder

Lots of fucking. She looks old, so she could die and it wouldn't matter."
Cows do the same thing. They can's see depth well without any cues so they just keep staring this weird little square that just keeps getting bigger and bigger for some reason and then splat.
"If the planet doesn't kill us through strangulation, i fear it will create something worthy of the job."
I've literally seen a person dying(was cut in two pieces) by a train that's running that show. He's lucky he only ate the handle
"Usually these type of people would get picked off by wild animals and enemies so only the smartest survived,thats not a case in the modern world because we dont have any predators and arent engulfed in constant turf wars"
We literally have billions of retries at this point. Millions of people can make fatal mistakes daily just to improve our current knowledge and we'd barely even know the difference.
The stupid majority are held up by the very tiny amount of actually intelligent people that have carried them along throughout human history.
The reason we got this far up the food chain *is because* people like this have died.
"When I was a teen and dumb and drunk, a group of friends and I posed next to a train for a selfie as it went by my friends backyard. My friend Josh threw his arm out for the picture and one of the rails just clipped his thumb. Fucking shattered his whole hand. He had metal sticking out of his hand for months that had to be tightened and it kicked off his still struggle with opiate abuse. The train wasn't even going fast. I gained so much respect for trains that night and was so grateful and lucky I didn't throw my arm out too."
"Natural selection to start with. Then as human race get smarter, the smart ones create foolproof measures in life to let the dumb ones survive. Then the smart-dumb spectrum in human race become wider and wider, but we survive, as a species.

... Until one day a dumb one somehow get access to nuclear launch code or something like that."
We’ll move heaven and Earth to save this person when they probably should’ve been dead 100 times already. We’re our own worst enemy.
We have stopped evolution in its tracks.  People that normally would die off are surviving and reproducing today due to technological advances.  Traits that would naturally be weeded out are continuing and getting worst.
Given the level of stupidity we display I'm surprised we weren't hunted to extinction BY the dodo.
Someone give this man a gold
Natural selection  ;)
"All jokes aside, the train driver is the real victim in situations like this. My dad is one and sometimes they hit things that are alive. Trains can't just stop on a dime. And whenever they do they have to take time off work and go through psych-evaluations just to make sure they're not ruined by seeing a living thing get smeared all over the front of their train."
"I know this is a joke but trains are extremely strong, normally after hitting a truck the only stuff that needs fixing is the handrails and sometimes a ditch light."
Is Butterbean ok?

I was on a train that hit a cow once. Wouldn't have known if the driver didn't share the info. Have felt much bigger bumps on normal track. Front of the train was a bit of a mess though.
"She lost track, too."
or she is probably just a Karen.

"Agreed.

Its like every person there was both blind and deaf. She might be stupid, yes, but she is also surrounded by stupid people. I know it isn't their responsibility to make sure she doesn't get hit by a train but I think everyones day is a bit better if no one gets hit by a train."
"It looks like somebody tried and she didn't move. But this was also filmed on a potato, so who knows?"
I think I saw Saint Darwin's silhouette appear in a frame. Might've even been smiling.

"Since she wasn’t seriously hurt, I could watch her with her impatient folded arms bounce off that train all day"
"“Move or you will be moved” - Okoye

The way she has her foot against the track makes me think she thinks the train runs inside the tracks.

Because their lives are empty.
Exactly. Well put.
She is now.
"She probably thought that she would be safe because she ""wasn't standing in the tracks!!"" But clearly she's a stupid person and apparently has poor depth perception"
"If I had to guess, here is what I think happened:

She was obviously recording on her phone. She was watching the train on her phone and it ruined her perspective on its approach. Also, I think she knew she was ""off the tracks"" and assumed to be far enough off them.

It was a really dumb move and she is going to pay the price for it. Hopefully she didn't get too hurt and learns to look up from her phone more often."
"I’m no expert, but it looks like the train caught their arms/shoulders, so I think definitely something broke, but I’m not sure about lethal"
"I'm not physicist but f=m*a right? 

So even if a train is only going a few miles an hour it's still thousands of tons. I couldn't imagine anyone surviving after being hit by a train at pretty much any speed"

My father was a train engineer for over 30 years. He told me a few stories from his time on the engine. I counted no less than 6 times he was operating the train when someone died.

Less than a year later he took his own life because he killed a kid. No one thinks of the person controlling the train.

She would just say she saw it and was going to move and you assaulted her.

Trains make cool videos; just don't shoot those videos FROM THE FUCKING TRACKS
"The front of the train has a writing and it that looks like it says  ""ferromex"" this is in Mexico,  these people board trains like we do public buses, in the most remote areas there are no train platforms, people just wait for the train to show up to a determined ""train stop"" and hop aboard.

A friend of my ex had an SIL that worked for the railroad.  He told some pretty ugly tales of the stupid shit idiots would do on or near the tracks.  PTSD was a real issue with some of them.

Trains are *so damn big*, so amazingly heavy, often moving at an impressive speed, and they're right there close to you. You could throw a rock and hit them. (Or, if you have bad judgement, you're close enough that you could reach out and touch them, as seen here.)

Large ships and aircraft are similarly impressive human creations, but normal people can't get anywhere near as close to those, when those things are moving, as they can get to trains. Things are less impressive when viewed from a distance.

"Hell, even maintaining the trackside equipment is deadly.  I remember the morning briefing I got from a flagger on a project one morning when he went ""..and be careful when around the tracks, a signal maintainer died last night after he fell through a missing catwalk."""
I just watch the movie Unstoppable with Denzel Washington. Good train movie.
Dumb question but why does hot iron need to be transported around? I've never heard of anything like that.
"If you do want to shoot as close to the tracks as possible - set up a camera on a tripod with the inward most foot NO CLOSER THAN THE VERY EDGE OF THE BALLAST. After that, stand an additional 10-20 ft back or more to ensure that, if the train derails, you aren't at risk. 

(I've done this a few times, however, it's worth noting the maximum speed on the line was about 25mph. Speed is a multiplier, after around 30mph line speed you want to start increasing both distance for both the camera and yourself.)"
"Two men on my crew and myself witnessed a coworker on a separate crew working on an adjacent track  being thrown from and subsequently run over by his own train. I’ll just say that I grew up kind of rough, no stranger to violence, and I’m not easily rattled.. but seeing that man getting killed,, dude just trying to do his job,, that changed me as a person for life... something like that happens to someone you work with, it doesn’t just effect them and their family... it’s rough on everyone involved"
"You dont have to imagine it, here it is.  [troma.com](https://www.troma.com/)"
Compress her until she becomes coal and feed her to the beast
As a doctorate in lethality and a minor in pain. I concur with your conclusions. Shoes still on leave a high chance of survival. typically when the shoes are lost or knocked off that person is at least 80 percent likely to be dead. And socks... whoo boy. You do not want to be hit hard enough to lose your socks...
That's a good point
It all depends on how long she stays there.
So you're saying not very much force was transferred into her because of her own relative weight compared to the train?
The energy transferred into her via the elastic collision is [more complicated than F=MA](https://gradestack.com/JEE-Main-2015-Complete/Collision/Kinetic-Energy-Transfer/19494-3784-40915-study-wtw#) and Newton’s Third Law.
"Momentum = Mass X Velocity

I think this may be more relevant here.  Even if that train was only going 10-15 mph, it had a fuck ton of mass so momentum was 10 to 15 fuck ton mph.

Analysis:  it's going to leave a mark if not death.

Edit: units."
Given how short the collision was it's like she ran into a cement wall at the speed of the train.
You should probably see a *train*ed psychologist about that.
"Unfortunately, it seems we've just found new and interesting ways for the dumb (well, more hopelessly myopic, technically) ones to lead our species into the spinning blades of evolution, and they've found out how to harness our strength in numbers for more nefarious purposes."

The only time it's safe to assume a woman is pregnant is if you can see the baby crowning
There's a sign for everything and a reason for it.
Ain’t that the truth.
r/angryupvote
My only regret :<
"She was steaming, I'm sure."
She may have been railroaded into it.
cue godzilla shriek from the train
Is that like *Flight* but with trains? lol
Is that the one where denzel washington is unstoppable?
How did that happen in the end? I work in a pretty busy railyard in a switching crew for industry and the safety rules are really relaxed. I can see this happening where I work 100%. Hell I almost got pinched riding out because we get so full sometimes we give the railcars like half a foot clearance or less to fit one extra car.
Hell yeah! Long live the Toxic Avenger!
We could call the train the flying Thotsman.
"Exactly that, and because she's a highly movable object. Of course the moving train has a ton of energy, but only an extremely small amount of it was transferred to her, and most of it went into moving her out of the way."
Yeah pretty much. Like a when you're riding a bike fast and a bee hits your face. I think the bee survives.
"You’re on the right track but it’s still not the whole story, since the train hits her arm and she isn’t fixed in space. 

Being hit how she was imparts a torque about a vertical axis through her COG/COM. 

And since she isn’t fixed in space, her body isn’t rigid, and she’s soft, the math is more complicated, since you’re looking at an inelastic collision resulting in both translational motion and rotational motion, plus constrained motion of her body parts. 


But like...she’s definitely fucked up tho"
"What’s even more relevant is the speed Karen has to reach. The maximum speed she can reach is the speed of the train. So the amount of momentum taken from the train is equal to Karen’s mass times the velocity of the train.

This doesn’t tell you anything about the *acceleration*she undergoes, which is the thing that’s going to be doing all of the injuring."
Not death unless she cracked her head good on the sidewalk when she landed. Though it looks like someone's helping her up towards the end?
"I'm seeing so much misapplied physics and math here. She's very likely not dead, just bruised. Very little of the energy of that moving train was transferred to her, and what little was transferred had the effect of moving her out of the way."
Also depends on the angle of the object that struck her.
Thank you for your valuable input
Nah. Don't underestimate the powers that be. They know a lot more than most of us could ever with the amount of time and money they have to accrue knowledge. But then again. Arrogance can make one just as foolish as stupidity can.
See. That’s nothin’.
Did the train knock some sense into you?
She’s definitely choochewing the pavement now.
Nice
To shreds you say
"Ah yes, the Ludacris theorem."
Very good way to think about it... if she was hot with all the force she would probably vaporize
Or like riding a bike into a brick wall.
I bet the deceleration hurts too.
Twice
Fell right on her caboose.
Is her apartment rent controlled?
"F=ma, bitch. Get out the way"
"Ah yes. Studied under Professor Luda Cris and man is he an amazing physicist. His ""move bitch get out the way"" theorem of force transferal perfectly explains why this lady might be very much alive."
"No, that feels completely different."
Same thing :)
"Oh, well never mind then."
Your punning is horrible :) Don't give up your day job.
How many bricks have you ridden into walls?
By the same train.
"Well, I guess that's kinda impressive."
Comment
Profile picture worthy.
Frame it
Only took one too eh?
And that's why you look at the photo right after its taken
It really makes us focus on the handy work of the Incas. Your dad is a genius.
Blocking photos with fingers is such a dad thing lmao I can vouch
I’m assuming by your footwear you didn’t trek the Inca Trail.
"My dad would have said: ""I did it on purpose, your face would have ruined the view"" :)"

"Was this the only picture you took of yourself at Machu Picchu?

 Hope you at least got one good one."
https://giphy.com/gifs/fail-camera-oops-3owypf6HrM3J7UTvAA
I'm sure he took a better one
Gotta respect your privacy
Is that an Alpaca Sweater?
Machu Picchu is great!
Was it the only one?
Don’t pretend like he didn’t take more than one
Am I really supposed to believe this is you? He looks nothing like you.
Lmao. Reminds me of when my mom ran into some older celeb (can’t remember who) and got my dad to take a picture of them. His thumb was right over the guys face. My mom still won’t let that go. Lol
Now it's the photo my dad took of *me* on our trip.
You kinda look like my Aunt Thumbprint
You really got to hand it to him
I'm on the cover of a MAGAZINE!
You look great!
Ur face looks beautiful
I'm pretty sure that's my dad taking a picture of me at Machu Picchu.
"My dad did this same thing, except it was my high school graduation. On. Every. Photo."
This sounds like something my dad would do... My dad and brother are at Machu Picchu...
This is something Home Improvement would do if Wilson showed Tim a picture of his trip to Machu Pichu.
Hey that's my picture at machu pichu.
Bless his heart !
The dad is strong with this one.
Might want to introduce him to rule of thirds. :P
"A: Please try not to cover the lens.
B: I'M NOT COVERING THE LENS DAMN IT!"
My mom is the same way. We went to Italy. Every photo of me is out of focus or I'm missing my head. We were there for over a week.
It's nice of you to take a person with special needs to Machu Picchu.
HES DOING HIS BEST OK
"This reminds me of my trip to DC(more specifically the white house).  So basically my mom had given me a disposable camera to take photos(I didn’t have a phone) and i had spent a good 3 minutes getting the perfect angle for the photo, and i thought i got the perfect photo of it, I was really exited to get the photos processed and show my parents the photo. When i got the photo some lady was standing in the middle of the god damn photo ruining the scene."
Plot twist: he’s not your real dad.
"I’m going there in two weeks, hope I get a better picture"
If only you could see your photo instantly after you take it.
Machu Peakaboo
"If this were me, I'd be extremely happy, because not showing my face is when I look best"
Your fly is open.
Why did you post this on here? You act like he didn't take another shot that didn't have his hand in it. You didn't just say herpa derp I'll just check after we leave Machu Picchu.
You got fingered
On your next trip take good and bad pictures like this so you can excitedly show your friends the bad ones
"Not even the real Machi Picchu, fake news"
I feel like I’m there with you guys.
I like your haircut
I’m sure there’s a sub like /r/dontblamethephographer haha
"If only you'd thought ...

You could have posted it w/a throwaway account on the sub that takes photoshop requests."
Hopefully you took more than one photo while you were there
Aw...
Is your dad Brien Foerster?
Time for a new dad
"Hahaha, he's a pro!"
"your father hates you, there I said it."
You went and only took one photo?! I took like 75 lol
"from the pose, it doesn't seem like you were particularly happy to be there tho."
Are people still allowed to walk all over the place? Seems like it’s ruining the topography.
So you’re frisk from undertale
Wasn’t it hell walking around in those shoes?
Every picture and video my parents have ever taken
You always take like half a dozen pictures minimum.
Will you look at that! I’m on a Mountain!
He’s really captured the magic spirituality of the place.
I don’t believe that is you! Your face is covered up we gotta see it
nice fit tho.
I see your dad went to the same photography school as my grandmother.  That woman never took a picture without her finger in it.  Not once.
"When I was maybe 8 my dad took me to a baseball card show where Pete Rose was signing autographs. I was a big Reds fan at the time. I was up next and I handed my 35mm disposable camera to my dad and said here, take a picture when I’m up. We get the film developed and it is a picture of Pete and about half of my arm as I’m handing him the ball. I think that was as disappointed as I’ve ever been in my dad.  His defense: “You said take a picture of Pete Rose!”"
/r/photoshopbattles material.
Mah wife's husband!!!
I’d like to think that it’s a photo of all of us at Machu Picchu.
Pics or it didn't happen
Reminds me of my dad trying to take a video of old faithful when he visited Yellowstone. Since there was glare on his screen he couldn't see what he was filming that well and ended up recording a video of the ground next to the geyser.
Oh dad.
This is someone's album cover
"My family is all Peruvian, and I’ve never been there"
"Let's go explore the ancient wonders.

Hold on let me get my dress shoes."
"Um, how do we know that's you?"
This is a winner
Old people all do this
"Dang, too bad they haven't invented devices yet that have screens showing exactly what's in the frame."
"Sucks for your dating profile, these pictures are definitely all the rage, I guess."
Now you have an excuse to visit next year
Send this to /r/PhotoshopRequest and see what hilarious magic could be recreated of the top half.
Yeah I have a dad-photo of me in Spain. It's just my tiny head at the very bottom of the frame and then a bunch of sky.
Hey... that's one way to block out the ***sun***.
"Dads. Aren’t they the best?

I’d personally enlarge that, frame it & put it in a prominent place in the home. I’m not joking. Do it!"
Frame that & hang it
this is better than a regular  vacation picture of Macchu Picchu
Were starting our hike up Machu Picchu in 12 hours! Where are you guys staying!
"Dad: ""Here's the pic I took of you at Machu Picchu!""  
You: ""Nailed it, Dad. Thanks and I love you."""
You should photoshop your face over the top of his hand.
Maybe we have the same dad. His finger was in front of the camera when I took a picture with the Millennium Falcon.
This can't beat my dad taking pictures of me when my mother gave birth to me. We have no pictures since all of them were taken with a finger blocking the whole picture. 31 years later and we still tease him about it.
This is honestly fucking hilarious and a great profile pic.
"Gawd, Dad....you had ONE job..."
Wait. That's me
Did you hike up that hoe in wingtips??
"Too bad there is no way to check right after a photo is taken to see if it is any good. If I was OP I would have asked for another photo, but I’m also not trying to farm karma for something that doesn’t actually suck"
F.
*You’re back from Machu Picchu and you’re speaking Spanish?*
Don't tell me this was the only picture he took of you
Are those Clarks?
You blinked
It's a premade censor bar
Good thing now away days you can instantly check it and not have to wait until it’s development to see that it sucks.
This is how r/streetwear takes pictures. Show off the fit  not the face.

Always double check pics!
I still don’t understand pics like this. It’s not like it’s the age of film cameras and only having 24 shots
The fog has a new challenger!
Love your smile.

Yes let’s all pretend this is the only photo he took there.

Classic dad
And this is my dads finger and I at
Don't know what to tell ya. Time for a new dad.
Reminds me what Paul Rudd does with his pictures lol
This photo seems a bit off to me. Interesting footwear for the thousands of steps involved in Machu Picchu. Shadows don’t seem to line up either.
You know the dad was in the crime scene when the fingers are involved. Big fat fingers blurring your sight on every occasion they feel like.
Giant persistently out of focus flesh clouds have become a real problem in that part of the world lately.
"Fortunately you can photoshop yourself in a picture. It's cheating a little, but you actually went so you can say that's a picture of you, next to Machu Picch."
is that his nose!?
Looks exactly like a picture my dad takes
You look nice.
Got the same photo with Steve Young... But didn't get to take another... Thanks Dad.
Pm me your face In similar lighting and I can photoshop the hand out for ya. (And is you have another similar picture with the bg)
you need to shave
At least there's no doubt you were there... oops... nvm.
"Reminds me of every CL ad for a car ""blurring"" the license plate"
Wait until it evolves from happiness into Machu Pikachu
"Good guy dad, censoring your face for the internet.

Those parents never stop to protect you, I guess."
Liar! That's me!
Ypu should be happy that ur dad was there to share those moment with you
I’m not convinced it’s you.
looks like my dad except he doesnt have a body either
Dad basically hiding the severe mistake he made .
That could be anybody OP.
Why does your dad have his dick out
"nice picture,like he's hiding something."
Lol

r/killthecameraman
How can we be sure that's you? >.>
Is Machu Picchu so accessible that you can wear those kinds of lace up dress shoes? I imagined a hike was involved.
"Nice sweater, though!"
Such a beautiful fingers
it's really nice.
You might want to have that looked at. It looks like a huge tumor has grown from your head. Bro..
"Knowing Reddit, someone could splice a regular photo and this to make a natural looking face and remove the finger."
"At least you know instantly now. I remember when you’d get back from vacation, take in your roll, wait on it to develop, pay and then see this. Hilarious? Yes. Kind of a bummer? Also yes."
I think he's trying to send you a hint
"nice body, dude!"
Machu Pinky.
At least he protects your privacy
At least he knew what to do with his hands.

Get some decent clothes
"How is this still a thing that happens? When taking a photo on a smartphone literally the whole screen shows what the picture will look like, I seriously don’t understand how this happens  or how people can be *this* technologically illiterate."

Also a lot of people out trick or treating
"A very embarrassing thing happened.

A friend from Ireland came to me the other day to chat. He said he wanted a sleeping pill and sent me a picture of that medicine. He asked me how much the medicine was and wanted me to buy it for him. Actually, I really don't know what he's talking about. I have been trying to explain to him,but He insisted I know, he also said the price is negotiable. In the end, he said angrily to me: ""this medicine is made in India. How can you not know because you are Indian? why don't you want to help me?""  
I wish I could help him, but the thing is I'm not Indian......... When I told him I wasn't Indian, we all laughed."

Years from now you will cherish this pic though
Aww you look so happy
I think he improved it
This reminds me of when film cameras where the common. You thought you had that great photo with this great place in the background only to find out it's off focus or there was dirt in the lens. Thank God for digital cameras!
That is one for the album. You will end up looking at and showing off this photo far more than if you’d been in it!
"Pretty mediocre photographic forger. They cut your head off.

I clicked thinking this was about Pokemon.
"What really sucks is when you live in the 1990s, and you take a precious photo. Then you can't see what the photo looks like, until you have got home, and sent the film off for processing and get them back some days later... to discover its like the photo the OP put.

&#x200B;

In reality today they'd have just taken the picture again after instantly realising the mistake."
Looks like what happens in Sims 4 when their photography skill isn't high enough.
better than the photos my friends take
You look just like him!
Why did your dad take a pic using his dick
nice shoes dude.
That is Nachu in the Pichu

You'll never look at that picture ever again anyway.

Edit: Gonna add some details to this for some reoccurring comments/questions. 
This was not the only picture taken today. My dad did take a few more but those were also not good so I just ended up asking other people besides him. I’m sorry if it seems misleading but I thought this picture was funny given the blunder and the location it was taken. This was the first sub I could think of where to post."
My mother had the same skill. All of my prom pictures look like that.
don't forget to tag dad when you do
His dad followed the photography rule of thumb.
"Real talk tho, this shit is definitely profile pic worthy for Grindr."
You got to hand it to him...
It’s going to be his Christmas gift so he won’t live down the shame.
Bop it
Hope he frames better than his dad.
"In my opinion, it was a bit pricey but also worth it. We took a van/bus to a small village (cannot for the life of me remember the name) that had a train station. The train ride was a little over an ho and a half but the car was one of those observation cars with occasional commentary. We then took a 20 minute bus from the train station (my parents are older and didn’t want to hike). We had a tour guide for the four of us (a family friend with us as well) so super small. I think it was around $300 per person but it’s a full day adventure."
"No, I was just there in May and it was super affordable, way cheaper than trips I've taken in Europe (except Greece).  I was there for ten days and only spent $1800, including airfare and super nice hotels."
Yeah the rent is too high people can’t even afford roofs over their heads!
"Yes, but in return you get +25% gold from all city connections so that kind of makes up for it."
"Nope, not for a westerner at least"
Nothing is expensive there if you Airbnb and travel domestic from Lima. Obviously if you stay in the tourist area it will. But usually if you get a Airbnb there it would be out of the tourist area. The train from Aguas Calientes to Machu Pichu is expensive 140$ for 2. Also account for transportation from Cusco to Aguas Calientes which is about 60$ 2hr car ride.
True! He can be a bit oafish at times but isn’t that what a dad is?
Do or do not there is no try
"From my own dad experience, this is part for the course"
I can’t believe it....IM ON THE FRONT PAGE OF REDDIT!!

What can I say? The camera loves me.
Underrated comment
There’s a few but this one is just top tier. There’s also one where his finger is focused but my face is super blurry.
Good point! It’s a very nice wall.
It makes for a good thumbnail though.
Nope! I’d love to one day! I was with my parents and a family friend who would not manage such a feat at their current age.
Ah thank you. I did it in sneakers and fell over that many damn times. I was impressed with OPs goat like light footedness at first
Nah I took a bunch of good ones. But I do now have a great series of these as well.
Other people did. He kept repeating this style.
"Nope, just your garden variety thrift-store cotton sweater."
"Nope. There were a few more failures but many more good attempts. The pictures I took look way better cause, you know, I’m not in them."
Nope! He took a lot more! Those turned out about the same. And so I quite asking him to take photos and had other people instead.
Someone mentioned making a sub about photos done like this and I think r/PopCropped has a nice ring to it.
Damn you
How hard did you look?
">Machi Picchu     
    
Was that also an Incan city, but not quite as well-known or popular as *Machu* Picchu?"
"But wouldn't this picture *not* really belong in r/dontblamethephotographer, since the finger over his face was totally the fault of the photographer, and the picture would therefore belong in r/blamethephotographer?"
"Lol nah I took a lot. I just have a series of my dad’s finger photobombing me. To be completely honest, this was the first sub I thought of posting it on and now I’m sweating that people are going to be mad at me since technically there was a happy resolution."
I... uh.... always feel awkward posing for photos (especially in public places) and it’s incredibly easy to pick up on that.
Not at all. They’re way more comfortable than they look.

"Not if somebody photoshops the thumb out, obviously"
Was this picture taken on an iPhone? Was it a Live Photo? Perhaps if so you can adjust the key photo in the edit menu from your gallery...
I like your shoes.
You should see if one of the amazing photoshop wizards out there can fix this for you man.
( (it is funny!!) )
"I understand

As a kid we went to Disneyland. My parents had a video camera. Not a lot of video of us walking through the streets or some of the rides. A shit ton of video of my moms damned feet."
">then I realized that I won’t be revealing my face lol  
  
Until another redditor will do some voodoo magic, remove the finger and then reveal your face"
"Well, to be fair to your dad, if he hadn't covered your face, you could have still posted it to this sub with the title, ""This photo of me wearing this sweater in public."""
"If you have a some other straightforward pics of yourself looking at the camera, I can totally photoshop a replacement Machu Pichu tourist pic for you. In case anyone hasn’t offered yet."
"Imagine if you were using and older camera with film, so you only get to see how the photos turn out after revealing them. In times like this I can’t be thankful enough for digital cameras. XD"
"so this is what my nefarious enemy kind of maybe looks like. the ""end of sentence lol"" person.

edit: my trivial annoyance at the usage of ""lol"" on the end of a sentence does not preclude me from saying nice shoes, man."
That’s amazing. You need to post a picture of it hanging on the wall. Lol
"Very informative, thank you"
"How was the altitude?

My family wanted to try and plan a trip but i recall people saying they had some trouble breathing at such a different altitude than what they were accustomed to."
Does the ho and a half cost extra?
"It was probably Ollantaytambo, and then the train to Aguas Callientes, where you get the bus up to the site."
Was the small village Ollantaytambo?!? I was just in Peru last October/November and took a similar route to Machu Picchu. Peru was my first trip out of the country (Canada) and I went on a two week tour by myself ! Beautiful country.
Olyamtaytambo is the town
If you are the adventurous type I'd take the hike to get there. It's a 3 day hike and it had some of the best scenery I've ever seen. A lot of it better than Machu Picchu.
How's the weather and temperature? I am starting the Inca Trail next week and kinda nervous about it.
Cusco is the name of the town.
The Village is Aguas Calientes which then goes to Machu Pichu Town 1:30min away.
You're right mostly because they're long dead
But Gandhi is in the power
Yeah my dad is a total fish sometimes
I’m a dad. I can’t ever get my finger to look that good but I keep trying!
Read through that askreddit thread about men stereotypes
"Can confirm. My dad never gets the distance, angle, etc correctly."
My dad would certainly do this on purpose. Followed by a few good ones which he will spend WAY too much time pretending he didnt take.
"I thought you said oarfish and I was like, ""Ah, that's why OP's mom went with him"""
"1) sounds like you at least got one with your face showing and not blurry?
2) any chance these are Live Photo’s? If so, you may be able to find a better frame"
"""theres a few but this one will get me the Reddit karma"". 

Guessing you've seen all the recent posts of people at famous landmarks with terrible weather ruining the pictures, and you decided to jump on the hype?"
"If you can't do the in a trek (because of ticket availability) I booked the Salkantay trek in cusco the day before and did the full 5 days with entry, a guide, pack horses, a chef, a waiter and 2 horse wranglers for $175.

Taking the time to book things on location will save you an utter fortune over booking at home before you go. But I guess that's the trade off for time."
He's doing you a favor. Making sure your identity is safee from all these prying eyes on the internet.
It’s a very good sweater. I came to this post to see if there was more info on it.
That's how it always goes man. I do photography as a hobby and everyone's photos look great but it's damn near impossible for me to ever have a good photo from someone else taking it. Framing and just about everything will almost always be off.
"Yes, quite."
Made you look!
Mapajahit? Mahapajit? Majapahit? It could very well be
"Damn, can’t even walk around in other shoes than trainers without my feet feeling pain lol"
Are they chukka boots? They look nice but I also thought they might be uncomfortable for hiking at first.
Done.
Instagram worthy.
OP also has an Apple Watch with a grey band and very stylish brown leather shoes if that helps
"I did it for him.

It's beautiful."
"Yeah breathing is a bit more difficult and some people experience headaches and higher heart rates. Machu Picchu wasn’t bad but Cusco is where I feel some difficulties. 

The locals say to chew on coca leaves."
"Depends on how fit you are, personally besides not being able to run for a km i was fine, machu picchu isn’t that high compared to some other parts of peru. Just dont fly there right away, slowly go to higher places. **EDIT:** just eat coca leaves and you’ll be fine. Well besides you’re tongue, it’ll feel like a sleeping leg just your tongue instead of your leg"
"Aguas calientes, you pass through ollan"
Aguas Caliente is the town. You do pass through Olly on the way though.
"The morning was chilly but having the sweater up there was a little over kill. I actually got a slight sunburn. It was sunny for most of the day, which we were very fortunate for. It began to rain as we left on the train.

Good luck though! It’s something I would like to accomplish one day!"
"I did the trail just under two weeks ago and the weather was pretty perfect aside from the morning of day 4, which absolutely poured down. Thankfully it more or less stopped by the time we got to MP itself. I was in Peru 2 weeks overall and that was the only rainy day I had, but it is now the start of the wet season so YMMV.

Temperature was probably around 20 degrees most days with a mixture of sun and overcast. That said, definitely wear suncream and get the hat too. Even though the temperature isn't that hot, you will still get burnt without it. If you have any other questions about packing or the trail itself, feel free to pm me."
We took that first bus from Cusco. I think the town we took the train from Ollantaytambo.
"Oh right, the poison. The poison for Kuzco. The poison chosen specially to kill Kuzco; Kuzco's poison.

...

That poison?"
No
"Aguas Calientes is the name of the town.
   
Cusco is a train ride away."
"Nah, Olyamtaytambo. They would have left from Cusco probably."
And there are no roofs (well almost none
I’m a dad and I’m definitely an oat fish.
I did the same! Truly an amazing experience. It was almost otherworldly finally arriving to the town and seeing people with nice clean clothes pull up in the train or buses after we spent a couple days hiking there. I recommend anyone interested in visiting Peru to consider the Salkantay trek.
"Wtf? 5 days of hiking? Are you a seasoned hiker? I remember climbing half a mountain to the Umantay lagoon and I was dying, same as with Huayna Picchu. I cant even imagine hiking entire days."
well played

"Same here.  I had a bad headache whole time I was in Cusco, felt fine by the time I got to Machu Picchu."
"I went to a travel clinic and from what they told me altitude sickness can hit you even if you are very fit. It can even hit you if you've been at altitude before without any issues. They made it sound very unpredictable. I got some of the prescription altitude sickness meds for my trip in a couple of weeks, just in case. I'll be in Cusco for a few days before I start the climb so hopefully that gives me enough time to get used to it."
Yup
"Not really that dangerous, especially if you go with a good tour group. I went this summer and was amazing, highly recommend it. Didn't experience much rain though so can't say about that but if you go in the Dry season you will be okay."
"I am mostly packing light with layers for rain and cold. Hopefully I get some days that look as clear as the one in your picture.

Might have to pack a sun hat to stop my face/neck from getting a burn."
Did the guide tell you that the believed extinct tree called Ollanta was recently rediscovered?
That's possible too

"It really was funky. The conductors were all business, then halfway through the ride, there was a little music and they came out in sweaters that were for sale. Btw, I got an alpaca scarf(and a blanket!!) later on elsewhere in Peru and they were the softest things."
"it is, but I was feeling bad petting the alpaca later at Machu Picchu. I'd feel the same with a belly full of hamburger if I was petting a cow."
"well, not really"
Thanks
How’s you do this magic
Oh you're on mobile. Thanks.

Definitely not.

Fair enough. Just a funny sentence.

Comment
Michael Davis!
"How can you not link to the whole clip


https://youtu.be/NdLNS6aK8NQ"
That wink. Not a dry seat left in the house.
"He manages to make it look both really impresive, and not impressive at all, at the same time. I'm impressed"
Nailed the smirk at the end.
Wow. He's a quite a skilled ball handler.
This guy is obviously a student of Demetrius Vickers
"No, that's a guy juggling two balls while waving a third around in the air with his other hand. /s"
I remember watching this back in ‘84. I learned a few of this guy’s tricks and incorporated them into a simple routine.
"In [siteswap notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap), he is juggling the 4-2 pattern for over 50 cycles and then transitions to 3.

Patterns repeat, so 4-2 is 4-2-4-2-4-2-…  The numbers refer to how many beats until a given item is thrown again, with beats alternating between hands.  2 needs to be ""thrown"" so soon that it is actually a hold operation; his left hand is doing that while the other hand has 2 balls in repeating 4s.  left: throw (4); right hold (2); left: throw (4); right hold (2); …

3 is a normal cascade.

One thing to note about siteswap is that if you take the sum of all of the numbers in a series and divide by the number of hands used you get the number of items.  4-2 uses 2 hands, and involves 3 items.  3 also involves 3 items,

Also, odd length series (3 has length 1) are symmetric, as you do the pattern left-to-right and right-to-left, where even length series (4-2 has length 2) are asymmetric.

It can be an interesting abstraction on juggling, but obviously doesn't capture the other flourishes he is using."
Is it possible to learn this power?
"Just showing that gif completely misses the point of his routine lol, this is not supposed to actually be impressive"
I assume the balls are the orange pixels?
"That look of “yeah, I have no fucking clue what’s going on!” Makes it!"
"Technically it’s 5 balls, the other two is where the real magic happens"
"Those are all pretty easy tricks. Yo-yo, robot variations, through the middle, mills mess on one side."
Even when engaged my last three brain cells to track the balls but nope...
Slightly reminds me of James Acaster
"Honestly, that’s how I would do it..."
Op is gonna be blown away by the people who do that with chainsaws.
That's such a large file size for such a low quality clip.
Well that escalated quickly
“Stopping is a problem”
He never let's go of the third ball
This man stole my girl smh!
"And with this skill, he impregnated the whole nation"
I puked for some reason.
I bet he can playreally good drums!!
"The commentary is the best part. ""Now juggling 2 balls with one hand isn't too hard...now watch as I insert a third ball into the mix"""
Thought he was holding one ball with his left hand the entire time like it was meant to be a gag or something. Only now I realize this guy sold his soul to the fuckin devil
Guys juggle 2 bqlls each day anyways so this dude just had to learn how to juggle the third.
"Its not that hard, one is still. He only juggles 2!"
I love ball fondling
I can do these. I've got 6 ball but barely so.
Sounds like a pornhub title...
I wonder...the obscene amount of time he must have spent practicing.  Is it worth it?
"Man, Carlin's act really was different before his AM/FM days."
My [favorite routine](https://youtu.be/XKRrfAzdpW8) of his work.
True story; In first grade for a talent show I juggled 1 Ball. Everyone in my class thought it was awesome so did I. It wasn’t until a few years later that I figured out that it wasn’t really juggling but just throwing a ball up in the air and catching it. I’m 50 now and when I think about that day it makes me smile.  My life was quite simple then.
"Thank Christ, I knew we could do better than “guy,” considering how talented he is."
THE MICHAEL DAVIS! Not just 'a guy'.
He’s hilarious
"Such a great set.  Wonder what happened to that guy. 

Guess I’ll head to google now."
"thanks, the low frame rate in the gif is just awful"
I'm so happy I scrolled through the comments!
"So glad I watched that. Very smooth and entertaining. Maybe it's just me, but that kind of humor seems to be rare these days."
That was epic! Thank you!!!
man I miss this style of comedy
"Thank you for that. I saw that show when broadcast - I was on a gap year to help out in the family business, and so all my friends were at school. I remember seeing it and being blown away, but not having anyone to talk about it with - especially the first line. The next day I tried juggling one egg while making breakfast, and dropped it. 

No car, no money, no friends, and working 16 hr days. what a long time ago."
Handles those balls nearly as well as OP's mom.
PHYLLIS! DO YOU BELIEVE IN ME?
Deangelo Vickers......
"Was a little surprised, I came here to write exactly this ^^^

He's only juggling 2 balls at a time, .... just like any other guy :)"
I scrolled till I found the testicle joke.
Thanks!! Was looking for a detailed siteswap notation.
I think he's using telekinesis.
"You can learn it in like, an hour. Takes a lot longer to master it"
Not from a Jedi
"This guy also did that.
OP got like one of the least interesting clips to post."
i'ld say 2 in one hand is sleightly harder than 3 ball cascade but not much. If you can do 2 balls in 1 hand with both hands you can juggle 4
"Juggling 2 balls in one hand is harder than juggling 3 balls between two hands. It is effectively half of 4 ball juggling. Learning the different movements of the hand holding the ball is actually much harder than juggling the 2 balls, it becomes a rubbing your belly while patting your head type thing which it is difficult having both your arms do such different things."
"This is a clip from Johnny Carson back in 1984. He's a juggler who made it to Carson's show and we're watching it again 35 years later. I don't know if you can measure the worth of the time spent, but it seems like it paid off to me."
"He's a world-class juggler by profession... yes.
He juggled axes and machetes in front of the president, no joke."
Seems like a complete waste of hate when you consider James Corden's walking about being all James Cordeny
"The right hand is juggling 2 balls in a pattern called ""columns"" while the left hand is mostly tracing patterns in the air for various effects."
r/confusingperspective
Thanks for sharing that! Just found a new favourite video
This is so awesome. Same as the people who share awesome links like this are awesome.
[The Howling Cowboy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0YjR11bx8)
"The whole thing is great but the more subtle joke got me after he says the egg is a natural enemy of the bowling ball. He tosses up the bowling ball and it drags him down while catching it, then he tosses up the egg and his arms raises after catching it."
"Ah, haven't seen him in forever. I love his sense of humour and timing. And a pretty good juggler, too. :)"
That’s great I needed the laugh
"Genuinely one of the funniest things I’ve ever watched, thanks for linking that"
"Yes, but have you seen him perform for President Regain?"
This Benediddum Crunderdunder-lookin motherfucker had me in TEARS at 1:46
"I know humor is subjective, but I really think this video could be shown as an example of something that is objectively funny from any approach"
Ok I work with kids and I'm gonna try to impress them with this trick! If I remember I'll update you.
I like the ending of that story. I feel like many born after may feel embarrassment and dumb rather than be able to enjoy the simplicity of their youth.
One of my fond memories was when I juggled 2 spoons while walking around the hall out of boredom while unbeknownst to me a classmate or 2 were watching the whole time and thought it was great
Not just any guy. THE guy.
"Highlights from Wikipedia: 

On October 1, 1973, Davis started a six-week course at the [Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Clown_College). Over 3,500 applicants were whittled down to a group of 38 men and 7 women ranging in age from 17 to 35. Upon completion, successful candidates were offered a contract with the [circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus). Davis was chosen to be a Ringling clown based on his distinctive deadpan style. 

On January 20, 1985, Davis performed at the inaugural ball following the [Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inauguration_of_Ronald_Reagan).

On July 10, 1990, Davis entertained President [George Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush) and other world leaders at the [16th G7 summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_G7_summit).

During the early 2000s, Davis was head writer and performed nightly for seven years at [Teatro ZinZanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_ZinZanni) in San Francisco."
https://i.imgur.com/eWGrhgw.gif
what did you find
"Im pretty sure he still performs, I saw him in 2013 in France."
"I think this guy is from the old days of TV - like Johnny Carson or the Ed Sullivan Show. It's amazing there is an available video, imo."
"Someone above linked the whole clip and he says near the start of his act ""As a youth, I practiced and practiced with two balls in one hand til I was almost blind."""
"Watch the full version. He makes the best single testicle joke I've ever heard... and that's a joke you'll only get after watching the video.

[https://youtu.be/NdLNS6aK8NQ](https://youtu.be/NdLNS6aK8NQ)

Credit to u/SirManCub for dropping the link in another comment."
That was pretty great now that you mention it. Amazing act all around.
"i thought that there was even an even more subtle context to the joke.   

at the end he again juggles 3 things fluidly. something lots of people can do. he juggles at the end so fluidly (the only way to juggle) that it might not be apparent to you all the extra skill he has for juggling things with massively different weights. 

the natural enemy joke helps you realize the extra skill he displays at the end. (if you think the juggled bowling ball is still a real bowling ball)"
"Yeah, we ain't got all night."
"Dang, I just came from a five-year-old archived post and this exact gif was used in the comments.

I know it's a pretty common gif but still weird"
He found out what happened to him. They're together now.
[He's still alive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Davis_(juggler\))
He's 66.  Still alive.  Was still performing juggling in the 2000s.  The highlights of his career were definitely in the mid-late 1980s though
"Here he is speaking in a 2008 documentary (this is just a promo for the documentary)

Mountain bike racers........ riiiiiiiiight!
My knees!
sure.....i’ll def use that to train my ”mountain biking”
I’d fall off.
Why does he keep yanking on the cord like that?
Not bad for mogul skiing as well
My knees hurt just looking at that.
If the shake weight were a pokemon this would be its final evolution.
"SHe's keeping dead centre gravity, pretty good."
Sure...
Looks like it would be a good trainer for horse racing too
Never thought I'd see Kate Courtney on this sub...
"I first read it as ""Contraception training for mountain bike racers."""
"If you didn't explain in the title, I would have assumed it's utter nonsense.
I still think it is but can see why some one would use it."
We will probably see this modified and used in a porn hub video shortly into the new year.
"I can see how this would put you in shape, but...

Wouldn't this be more expensive than actually just buying a mountain bike. I mean, your training to ride a bike. Couldn't you just... buy a bike?"
"This kind of stuff is why we are seeing such amazing athletics nowadays, with the cost and ease of manufacturing things today and the interconnectivity of communities, you find enough people who like doing a thing that they can get together and figure out a machine to get really good at just a real specific thing."
Where can i get one for my wife?
Is this the RedBull gym in Santa Monica?
A day at the horse track.
WE GET IT! You crossfit!
My knees hurt watching this.
"That's the easy part.  Now do it pedaling.

Why am I like 90% certain this is in a crossfit gym.
On the next episode of BLACKED...
I think I saw someone doing this on the assisted pull-up machine at Planet Fitness.
Training for using the bike pump
No need to pedal on a mountain bike.
The ultra t-bagging machine
"I can think of exactly seven ways to turn that into a crazy sex contraption.

I don't know how I got here"
A concussion machine?
I own a contraption for training mountain bike racers.  It’s got wheels on it. . .
Is this a necessary or effective exercise?
Monty Python did it better
I racing mountain bikes in early 2000. Ruined my knees big time.
Looks like a shit version of the Riprow idea.
"Or you know, just do squats and lat raises, which should be a standard repertoire for any athlete."
I can definitely hear her huffing and puffing.
That’s one of my favorite exercises when I’m Constipated.
You’ve given Japanese adult video directors an idea
"I am not an adult that races bicycles against other grown-ups, but if I were I would practice by riding my bicycle."
I'm exhausted just watching that.  I'd sit down on the couch except I already am.
I read it as contraception.  Made the title at lot weirder
I think that's Kate Courtney. She likes [tacos](https://katecourtney.com/tacos).
Training to ride cock.
"Or you know, do regular exercises..."
Meanwhile the Rocky version of her competition is currently eluding Soviet escorts to run to the top of a mountain.

Look at that guy loving his job. He probably spent his junior years pulling girls hair.
Kate Courtney is beast.
They can’t give her anything thicker than a string to grab onto?
Read that as contraception. Gave very different context to this gif.
I can imagine other uses
I thought she was training to be a jockey and then the guy started pulling on her reins to simulate the horse's movements and prably making 'WheeHeeheeheeSNORTPluurfHuurfPlurfHurfhurfdurf' noises.
I read this as contraception.... I will have nightmares.
Why not just bike?
Crossfit?
That just seems like squats with extra steps
It should churn butter.
Hahah oh how punishing the mountain top grind is
Nice >w>
GM test
I believe that would shake something loose that shouldn't be...
Can anyone explain what the trainer was doing? It looked like whatever he was doing just made it harder. Like if told you to jump higher and then shoved you as you jumped.
"My back hurts looking at this. It would hurt otherwise, but still."

Strap a dildo on this thing and you’ve got a whole new genre of porn.

Anyone else originally read contraception?
It's also an accidental fart generator.
No thanks.  Think I'll stick to weights lmao
All I can hear is Kramer’s “giddy up”
I read that as contraception and was very confused for a second
Where's Mac? This girl needs Mac's bang bike. This is half ass compared to the bang bike.
Or maybe go mountain biking?  I understand we train out of the activity for tons of things.  This seems like a whole lotta set up for what may be less beneficial than riding trail.

I'd like her to do that on my face. Ride the mustache!
Oh thought it was a gay dungeon apparatus.
"Man, you could bounce a coin off any part of her. Damn impressive."
"IDK, looks more like CrossFit than anything else"
1st world solution.
This is the stupidest shit I've ever seen

Mountain biking is much safer on small hills in the midewest.
Yeah there's no trees coming at her at 30+ mph
"As a mountain biker, I can confirm.

Although this machine is quite odd and I’ve never seen one before, it’s for sure safer than riding by a larrrrge margin."
[removed]
She'll be riding any way you look at it ;)
I like the part where the trainer tries to slap the dicks out of her hands but she maintains her grip and focus.
Death by snoo snoo!
I’m sure the manufacturer wouldn’t mind diversifying their market some.
I think it must be sex. They already have training contraptions much more compact for mountain bike racers. They're called mountain bikes.

Also known as CrossFit
I assume MTB world champion would have stronger than average knees.

"That’s Kate Courtney, 2018 mountain bike world champion and 2019 mtb World Cup overall winner! She’s a fucking beast"

"That's roughly where women's center of mass is, so it makes sense that it'd be fairly stable in this exercise."
Hm.. that is an Assessment
It’s not even *close* to “perfectly stabilized”
"I personally put ""the jiggalator"" into the hat."
I think it can be both

"It’s for training endurance, can do that more efficiently than going out on a mtb ride.  

She’s a professional mtb rider, a world champion, I trust there is serious thought and planning in her exercise program."
You'd need to find somewhere with loads of downhill whoops if you wanted to just practice this part.
At a certain point you become so good at doing a thing that continuing to do it as is just isn't enough to get better at it. Eventually you have to focus a work out on particular muscle groups in a more extreme way than you would do it normally.
"It's like riding a pump track as hard as you can like a max weight rep workout or neuromuscular workout with a lot less risk than actually riding a pump track, plus saves you the to/from time for getting to a rideable place, plus the mtb riding gear takes a good while to select and get on, and getting gear in/out of your transportation takes time.

https://adventuresportsjournal.com/pumpin-an-introduction-to-the-world-of-pump-tracks/

I live in the same part of California as the person doing the workout, the closest mtb area from me is half hour ride in either direction, driving would cut the commute time but add the drive/pack/unpack/drive time, and there are speed limits strictly enforced in all publicly accessible parks that are multiuse, only on race days in certain areas can one go as fast as one wishes or special pump track or gravity track facilities."
Yes
"Been mountain biking. 
I can confirm."
If your a professional mountain biker at the top of your game sure. For the rest of us we'd be better spending our time on the bike. She spends plenty of time on bikes and then trains harder in the gym.
She's a world champ. I guarantee you she spends plenty of time on her bike.

You should see more shit.
Could you explain why?
Learn to read.
"Sport specific. 

You don’t ride a mount rain bike with 225lbs on your back, hands over head and bar on your shoulders and not moving forward..

You ride you mountain bike on crazy hard to manage terrain that demands movement, balance and weight shifting for the entirety of the ride."
"how often does your body do these movements on a regular bicycle ride? probably never, unless in the mountains, where it’s dangerous, hence the practice."

That's small hill biking.
That's cyclocross.
"What a coincidence, whitewater rafting is much safer on low flow creeks too."
Singletrack it is. Lets ride
Goes hand in hand with the sport. Shoulders are usually the first thing to contact the ground in over the bars mountain biking accidents. Then knees. Which is the main reason why collarbone and shoulder separation/dislocation are one of the most common injuries in the sport.
How? It looks like she’s just holding a front raise.
"I had the same thought. Although I wonder if the resistance is set in such a way that you can keep your shoulder muscles properly engaged. Otherwise it seems really stressful on the shoulder. Could be wrong.
Looks like a bad ass quad workout if done right though."
"This is Kate Courtney. She is a recent college grad, and twice winner of UCI XC world cup, mutliple national championships, and is going to Olympics in Japan. 

Not only does she have way more money than you will ever make, considering her salary is close to a million a year,  but even if she did have shoulder problems (which she wont because bicycle riding, especially xc is far less impact on your body than other sports), she will have a much higher quality of life that you can ever hope for. 

So stop pretending like you know anything about anything fuckface. Go sit in front of your computer and think about how miserable your life because you dont have the balls to do anything with it."

"Joints kind of exist on a curve though. More use can make them stronger but overuse can lead to repetitive motion injuries in the soft tissue in and around the joint. 

Other body structures behave like this too. For example Bones will get stress fractures from overuse but moderate exercise can help build bone density"
The discs in your back do not get better with use. Eventually they wear out.
Nice
Is she a cross country rider? I only watch women’s downhill and haven’t heard of her. ‘18 was Atherton and this year was Myriam Nicole.
Still funny to look at
"If they made mass centered around women's asses, I might consider becoming religious. lol"
"Do you even know what stabilized means?

Watch how that part of her body moves in comparison to the background, or rather, how it doesn't."
Nah dude it’s teabag training.

I think it must be sex. They already have training contraptions much more compact for mountain bike racers. They're called mountain bikes.
It was posted 3 hours before your comment.
"I may be only five feet two, but I can sproing to six feet five no biggie."
Small hill cycling. Sounds so much more relaxed than mountain biking.
"Careful, Oregon thinks they own cyclocross"
Bungee jumping is much safer at low low heights too.
"Yep, my cousin used to competitively race mountain bikes.  Mostly cross country, but he did a tiny bit of downhill when he was younger and didn't fear death.  But he did race a lot, twice a month at his peak.

His shoulders are fucked beyond belief.  Regularly wakes up to one or even both of them dislocated.  He doesn't ever bring down even slightly weighty objects from high shelves, his shoulders would pop out just at the thought of trying.  He also never used a contraption like the one in this post, just peddled a lot with the only form of cross training being occasionally long distance running and hiking.  All that shoulder damage was from competing.  He had surgery recently and told me he hasn't woken up with dislocated shoulders since so maybe they fixed it."
"I managed to break my manubrium. Yeah, I didn't know what that was either."

"False - they can adapt to be thicker and stronger and also better hydrated with appropriate training. If you want to learn more, look into how high volume cycling affects lower backs and you'll find a study which looks at how people who cycle more than 110km/week have stronger intervertbral discs than normal for quite a large age range."
Yeah I only follow downhill too and I was like Ive never see the Athertons do this kind of training.
"She gets a lot of publicity because 1) American, 2) Relative newcomer 3) Attractive, 4) Red Bull sponsored

I didn't actually realise she'd won the overall this year, I only started paying attention to XC at the end of the year when she seemed to drop off - but so did Neff, and Kate started so strong she managed to scrape through"

Booty shakeweight
"Well shes a world champion, so trust her decision. 

With that said, she probably does squats also, this is more about stability and arms."
"You do this exact motion all the time while mountain biking. 

Doing it like this lets you train much faster and more efficiently than simply going out and riding. 

This is simply endurance building. It is faster and more efficient to build muscles this way than to ride ride and ride. It’s also less risky, which is good if you have an important race coming up and you don’t wish to risk injury."
Honestly hard for me to handle that kind of electronic music when I'm not off my shits on party drugs.

That’s a definite plus of being that small! I’d probably sleep with a bunch of friendly Maine Coons and pretend they were lions!
At what height do cats start to think you're fair game and they can take you. Cause I'd be worried if they started following him.
What an awesome experience. It’s like dancing with a tiger
"Ok r/imgoingtohellforthis, but can you imagine if this is only person that cat had contact with until some time later in its life, normal sized people would blow its mind"
That's a big cat
They now live together in Vermont running a bed and breakfast.
"I love this photo. 
So adorable and wholesome, plus, I love black cats. 
This mini panther was like a regular panther for this lucky guy."
Goals
"If that were my cat, that man would be dead. Well. He's probably dead. But he wouldn't have made it long enough to take a picture dancing with her, that's for sure."
I have a 9.2kg (just over 20lbs) Bengal and I’m pretty sure if I were that size he’d murder me.
I bet David Lynch could write whole plot of Twin Peaks season 4 based on this picture
At first glance I was like woah is that the world’s biggest house cat?
Please tell me this is real
"Dude looks like an Oompa Loompa. Not just because he’s short, but his face looks like the Oompa Loompas in the Johnny Depp version."
I would ride a dog *everywhere*.
My cat was 20 lbs and made me a little nervous
"Depends on the cat.

I have rabbits rats and guinea pigs and they have no prey drive towards them in fact I catch them sleeping with the rabbits.

But they do kill the field mice that get into the house.

Cats aren’t strictly killing machines, they aren’t dumb. Most can distinguish between friend and food.

So even if you were like 2” tall if you raised the cat from kitten hood it probably would still see you as a care taker but might accidentally kill u when it plays or something tho"
Oh god I was thinking the same thing. I would be terrified if any animal over 20 lbs started following me at that size!
*panther
Giants
Thank you for your input.
"Omg yes! And get a saddle! But not a labrador, might be too wild!"
house cat
Fun fact: there’s actually no species called “panther”. It’s either a black leopard or black jaguar which you can still see the spots in the black fur under certain lighting.
Technically correct
So the black panthers should have been renamed black black leopards?
The best kind of correct!
That might be never

Socialization is critical. You need a dog who is used to a wide set of situations. I'd  really concentrate on rewarding calm. You want as unflappable a dog as you can get.
That's cool.  Why can't he go on to be an actually full time seeing eye dog?  I've read that more disabled people are actively involved in the training of their service dog.
We will need progress updates!
"Please forgive my asking, but I wanted to ask if you were in the USA in regards to service dog training/laws. I believe it is different in some other countries so I hope you don’t mind my asking! Also, awesome work and very beautiful dog."
Good puppa
You think theirs a blind dog with a human named sightey?
He’s got the stare of one derpy dog and I love him
He has heimdall’s eyes
"Gorgeous dog and awesome name. Youre a greta person for doing this, do you do it professionally?"
Gorgeous Newfoundland who will make a great companion. Best thing if I was blind I would want a friendly bear to protect me and to comfort me when I needed it.
"Why not just have her keep him?

Also, training a dog for a job like this and then taking that job away will cause it a lot of stress. If he ends up not staying a work dog, you must keep acting like he's working."
There is something terribly special about this dog I don't know exactly why but his fur is special
He looks like a teddy bear!
Seems like naming the dog Braille will only confuse things further but what do I know
Perfect name!
 Great name!!
He looks PHENOMENAL too!
What a unit
Awesome name btw
"What kind of doggy?  Looks like a weimaranererer (how do you spell and say it?!)  crossed with an English mastiff or st. Bernard. 

And I hope this works out well!"
He looks like a golden with chocolate lab features
That's what we're thinking!
"That's the goal. The dog hadn't walked on a leash before I started a couple weeks ago. So now that his obedience and major commands (forward, left turn, right turn etc.) are understood clearly, now we'll be socializing and desensitizing him and promoting his own guides. He's only 7 months."
I’m gonna guess a Newfie! Is that right OP?
"To what I know, usually newfies cant be OFFICIAL ""guide dogs"" because of their love for water and protective tendencies. His girl will have to be 10 years old to be given her own official seeing eye dog though, and she's currently only a year and a half. So Braille will be her ""assistance"" dog around the house and in lighter situations until it's his time to pass on and she gets an official seeing eye dog. 

Official guide dogs are typically hand picked and started with desensitization and training as soon as they're ready to leave their litter mates as far as I know."
"Guide dog training is very extensive. We have training to just raise the puppies. Then they get months of training with a certified trainer. Guide dogs require the most work, they gave a lot of work to do."
"Well first of all Seeing Eye dogs are dogs from The Seeing Eye. It’s not a catch-all term for any guide dog. Since this dog isn’t from The Seeing Eye, it cannot be a Seeing Eye dog, no matter how well it’s trained."
"My mistake, yes I'm in the US. Here it takes away certain liabilities if the dog has been certified by a trainer to be a service dog."
"I mean kind of, i doubt they just say Braille over and over and over"
"Check out Doctor Mike on YouTube, he has the same breed of dog actually named Bear, and he did a collab video with Molly Burke (another YouTuber) and Bear and Molly's seeing eye dog got along great."
"Whats desensitizing? Sounds kinda sad

Thanks for downvoting me for trying to learn more about dog training :))"
"My sister puppy-sat for us when our girl was 5 months old. She took the puppy to her in-law's farm around all the tractor equipment. It only took one weekend. My dog is 5 years old and as chill as can be around large, loud engines and horses. Desensitization for the win!"
"Yep! He's a Newfie. Supposively ""blue"" colored, but more of a grayish chocolate. He's gorgeous to me!"
"Rock on.  So he has 9 years to love and care for this girl.  He's what?  1 here?  Giving good focus.  Good luck.

Hope the transition goes well.  Never thought about it before but it has to be tough on both the person and dog when transitioning."
"Depending on your location, I wouldn't say Newfies can't be offical guide dogs by law, in the US there are no breed restrictions in the ADA for Service Dogs.  There is also no legal ""offical"" guide dogs, just those that are breed, rasied, and trained by a program, which is by far the most common for Guides.  It's just that Newfies aren't ideal as a breed for Service Dog work in general, unless their suze is needed for mobility  assistance.  Most Guide Dogs come from programs that breed and train dogs specifically for Guide work (and even then more then half don't make if for one reason or another, the dog has to love it and be just the right fit).  Labs, Goldens and occasional German Shepherds are the most popular Guide Dog breeds for their temperment, size and abilities.  Most Guide dogs work at a quick pace, often German Shepherds are used for people who want to run or work their guide dog a lot because they are higher energy.  Labs are the most common Guide breed by far, because of their temperment, energy level, love of work, and their short coat is a benefit for easy maintenance.  A guide dog needs to be large enough for the dogs safety, because there is pressure being put on their body as they pull lightly into the harness so the handler can feel through the rigid guide handle.  Also, height is a factor because too long of a guide handle, to reach the handlers hand in a comfortable position, can risk injury to the dogs spine and is also less comfortableand effective.  Many guide dog users develop arm and shoulder issues from using the guide handle so much on the same side, and older guide dogs are retired before they develop arthritis or other old age problems from working.

So a guide dog needa to be energetic enough to enjoy their work, but also lay around and wait a lot when not needed as well.  A lot of any service dogs working time is waiting, out of the way, but at the ready.  They also get time off to just be a dog, usually harness on means working time, and harness off means be a dog time.  Some dogs act completely different when in harness, they go from goofy dog to serious working dog because they love their job and take it seriously.  

In any case, I can see a few issues with Newfies as full time guide dogs.  First of all is overheating, which is dangerous for the dog.  Second, is their energy level and walking speed, it's too low and they probably wouldn't be happy with the level of work a full time guide dog does.  Third, the coat maintenance is a issue.  Other issues would be the amount of space they take up, most blind people use public transit a lot, or fly with their dogs, and all service dogs need to be able to curl up out of the way, which is often in small places.  Newfies are also somewhat protective of their person, which is a no-no for any service dog.  They absolutely must not be agressive in any way, and they must not be bothered by all the weird crap the public throws at them.  Water loving shouldn't be a issue, labs love water too, it's a matter of training them to resist temptation when working.  Which all service dogs need for food on the ground, other dogs, people trying to call or pet them, etc.  Goldens are notorious for having to learn to curb their enthusiasm to meet new people and be pet when working as service dogs because they are such a happy, people loving  breed.  So each breed has it's advantages and disadvantages with temperment, size, and other factors.  But they all have intense and specfic training to become service dogs.

The most common service dog breeds, depending on use, are the so called ""Fab 4"" - Labs, Goldens, Standard Poodles, and Collies (Rough or Smooth coat, like Lassie).  They are well regarded as being the best temperment fit for service dog work, and when a service dog needs to be just the right dog, you are setting yourself up for sucess by picking one of those breeds from a good breeder who has produced service dogs before and rasies them with lots of early socialization.  Because the most successful service dogs begin socialization shortly after birth, before they go home at 8+weeks old and then have basic training as puppies to young adults before finishing their training around 2 years old.  That said, some other breeds are popular for size reasons, small dogs - Papillions and Shelties.  Giant breeds for mobility assistance - Great Danes, Newfies, Bernese Mountain Dogs/Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs.  Sometimes other breeds, mutts, even shelter dogs, can make good service dogs, but they are much less likely to work out in the long run (and now your out that time, money, effort and you have a pet dog to keep $, or rehome if your not allowed pets in your rental) and the odds are against you."

">newfies cant be OFFICIAL ""guide dogs""

I'm not very connected to the service dog world so I'm definitely not claiming that I know better than you/the girl's family, but afaik service dogs don't need any kind of official approval or certification... I mean, sure, a professionally-trained service dog might perform a bit better than one trained at home, but beyond that is there really any NEED to get her an ""official"" dog when, legally, they don't need any certification?"
There are no breed restrictions in the US. It depends on the temperament and training of the dog.
"Hit the nail on the head. I'm also not a certified trainer yet, just been apprenticing under one for a couple years now. So I'm no master, but able enough to get her a good helper and companion."
"So kind of off topic but I was in a restaurant sitting right next to a lady with a corgi that had an “Emotional Support Dog” vest on and the waitress came up and asked her if the dog was a Service Dog and she said yes. I promptly said no it’s not, it’s an ES dog. And they ended up asking her to take a table outside in which she vehemently demanded they stay inside.  They ended up leaving. I felt bad but at the same time I didn’t because so many people abuse it and not many truly understand (or don’t care) what a Certified Service Dog is"
"this is incorrect.  i owner trained my service dog with the help of my sister who trains service dogs through an organization.  I asked her about this since you stated you were in an apprenticeship here and I thought I might be mistaken.  Here is what she explained to me- you earlier stated that if an owner trained dog misbehaves they can be kicked out, but a program trained dog is protected because it was trained by a certified trainer.  this is incorrect- if ANY service dog is out of control, they will be kicked out, whether or not they were trained by an organization.  There are no additional protections for a program trained dog.  during training SOME states have allowanced for a program trainers to do PA training but not owner training, but not all states.  You also stated that US airlines require papers- this is incorrect.  airlines only require paperwork for ESAS and PSDs.  I just flew with my mobility and medical alert dog this weekend with no paperwork.  

please do more research."
"That, good redditor, was a joke.  

I've seen it happen, and it is super rare, but blind people do talk about braille.  Much like people who see talk about reading.   (Not about the story in a book, but about reading itself.  The logistics.)  So when I saw this, I thought about a group of people talking about braille, and the pup looking up confused every time he heard the word.  It was funny to me."
Just making sure he's nonreactive and not jumpy to loud noises or people being crazy or anything that could potentially make a normal dog scared or jumpy.
"Nothing wrong with asking a question if you are curious and don't know!  Many working dog people have been forced to become defensive because of how many people treat them as if they are animal abusers until proven otherwise,  so your wording probably came across that way to whoever downvoted.

Desensitization could also be called Confidence Building.  Basically you introduce things that could be scary in a gradual and controlled way so that it is a positive experience for the dog.  It usually involves a lot of treats!  Basically, ""oh look at weird thing, look at me, get a prize!"" over and over.  They learn that whatever weird thing is going on is no big deal and that they should keep paying attention to their handler and working.  Puppies have a time in their brain development when they are especially open to new experiences without fear, and those experiences will be more meaningful and remembered for life.  It's called the Socialization period, and it goes from birth to 16 weeks old.  That's why good breeders begin letting the puppies experience things well before they go home.  It's not a scary or bad experience for the puppies, because that would be the exact opposite of what you want.  Just like new, positive experiences are remembered for life, sonare bad ones so careful socialization is the goal.  Desensitization is kind of the older puppy/dog version of socialization.  They learn that things aren't a big deal and that they can ignore them while they focus on their person.  It's making sure they don't react overly to stimuli that can, and will, happen around them in real life.  It's vital for Service Dogs because they need to be focused on their job and able to work happily.  Service Dogs love their jobs and a unhappy or scared dog would be of no help to a disabled person, as well as just morally wrong.  Service Dogs deal with a lot of random things happening around them as they work, so extra focus is put on socialization and desensitization during their early life and training.  Don't worry, they get plenty of time to be a puppy too!  Too much training will burn a puppy out and make them not like working, so training is kept to short sessions that are all super fun for the puppy.  All of the training is age appropriate and pretty basic at the beginning, after they have mastered the basics and are happy to do those basic obedience behaviors in many different places, they move on to more specific and specialized skills that built up one tiny step at a time to become complex tasks they preform for their disabled handler.  And adult service dogs also get plenty of time off to just be a dog, and they love their job when they are working.  They may look sad or board, but that is because they are taking their job seriously and are only focused on their handler and their needs."
"Welcome to Reddit, once one person misinterprets your comment and downvotes it everyone else jumps on the bandwagon :/"
"In my region, there's a program of assistant dogs where noisy families take in a puppy for a year and need to expose it to as much noise, people and situations as possible. 

They can't keep the dog but it's a great way to get a dog for a short-time. A friend did this and they'd take the dog *everywhere*, and he was the sweetest."
"Interesting, I didn't know Newfies carried the dilite gene, so I went and looked it up.  Apparently they do carry it but it is very recessive, which is why you rarely see Newfies in this color.  However, breeding for colors like this is usually frowned upon because it is detrimental to the breed.  Hopefully this one was a happy coincidence in a ethical breeders program.  Anyways, dilutes also often have gene-linked hair and skin problems.  So OP may want to keep a eye out for alopecia."
"Agreed, absolutely stunning!"
"He reminds me of Violet the Newfie on twitter ([https://twitter.com/violetthenewfie](https://twitter.com/violetthenewfie)), such a beautiful color for an already gorgeous dog!

Good boy, Braille!"
"Awww, I groomed a Newfie at work today, and honestly they're one of the only labor-intensive groom dogs that I've done that hasn't put me off having one. They're a lot of upkeep but honestly, that pure, happy aura they have around them is so worth it. Add to that their natural protective and nurturing instincts, and you have the perfect babysitter. An excellent choice for helping a young girl navigate the world!"
He’s beautiful I love dogs mine are mutts I love them
"You said everything I didn't have the energy to type, so for that, I thank you! Lol"
"Depending on where they live this can be true.  However, most people using guide dogs have program trained dogs, even in places where owner-training is allowed, because of how much work goes into training a guide dog to be so reliable.  Even with the specifically bred labs from Guide Dogs for the Blinds long history of breeding program, over half don't make it to being a Guide Dog for one reason or another.  Guide work is one of the most demanding jobs Service Dogs do because it requires a degree of ""intelligent disobedience"", meanig the dog needs to be able to think independently and refuse a command if need be for safety.  They also have to be completely unflappable and reliable because a blind person is reliant upon them for safety if they don't have a cane with them.  Many people also don't realize how Guide Dogs work, they work just like the cane.  The handler still needs to know where they are  and where they are going, but instead of having to feel for obstacles the dog is looking for them and either guiding the person around them, or stopping to indicate a obstacle.  The benefits to a guide dog is they are much faster and allow the handler to walk a quick pace.  They also are trained to look for lonw hanging obstacles like tree branches when a cane wouldn't be able to touch and detect it.  But the handler is still the one navigating, the dog just walks in a straight line and indicates obstacles and physical features when asked, like ""find the door"" or to find the crossing walk button and then the curb cut out.  They cannot tell when it's safe to cross the street, the handler listens fir the traffic patterns and commands when to cross (dog finds the other curb cut).  However, you do hear about guide dogs saving their handler from traffic, which is that intelligent disobedience thing.  In any case, guide work is a LOT of training and then proofing that training in all sorts of places and situations because the handler is dependent on the dog and needs to feel confident in their abilities.  So most guide dogs are program trained dogs, and programs each have requirements to be eligible to receive a guide dog from them.  Most do not pair guide dogs with young kids because it's best they hone their mobility and orientation skills (how to use their cane to get around, and to know where they are and how to get there) before they use a guide dog because they need those skills to handle the guide dog.  In fact, most guide dog schools have a sort of ""camp"" where the new handler goes to meet their new guide and do some training as a team before they go home.  This usually takes a couple weeks, and the first few days are without the dogs.  The blind person needs to show that they can get around fine with a cane before they can have the guide dog.  They often have a kind of scavenger hunt or course around the city the gudie dog school is in to complete before they begin working with the dog alongside a trainer."
"So, service dogs for people with legitimate disabilities and are trained by a certified service dog trainer, get certifications that make them capable of going ANYWHERE with their handler, since they're performing legitimate tasks. 
You have your ESA's that only require a doctors note and $50 that require 0 training, but if someone really wanted to call that bluff, it's a bit on the controversial side. 

Hopefully I'll have my proper certifications before long, but either way, Braille will make a great companion and provide proper guidance for his little girl for a while."
"Good for you. We raise guide dogs, my wife has a service dog. The rules should not be abused."
"I never said that a program dog is protected by anything. I've heard of ESA certified dogs biting someone in a place of business, and the person bit tries to sue someone. I know that service dogs with legitimate certifications are less likely to fall victim to such cases, and paperwork on training holds up much better in court than just a personally trained dog. 
I was referring to why Braille is being considered an ""assistance dog"", rather than a certified seeing eye dog. 
Thanks for the advice!"
Ohhhhh. Okay yea that makes sense
"Also, they are most open to this when they are younger because everything is new. They are learning from their parents and owners what is normal,  because nothing seems normal to them- it's all so exciting. 

But if they see other dogs/people ignoring something - rain, car noises, the squirrels, etc, they think ""this is a normal thing that I don't need to freak out over"", but if the dogs/people around them are nervous or react to a situation, they know to be leery of it. 

Useful skill from ""the wild"". mama wolf smells a bear and acts nervous - should be nervous too. mama wolf smells a squirrel - maybe food, but nothing to be scared of."
Total coincidence. The breeder hasn't ever seen the gene in his lines in 20+ years. So hopefully those skin problems wont pop up too much!
The insomina is giving me plenty of time to ramble!
"Thanks for all the information! I already kinda knew that guide dogs had some pretty rigorous training, and it obviously makes sense that a program is going to know how to train the dogs in an efficient manner... But that wasn't really the question I was getting at, haha. My point was that, if OP can train Braille well enough to perform the exact same tasks as a guide dog trained by the program, then why shouldn't Braille be thought of as an actual service dog? Service dogs aren't required to have any certification by a program."
"I'm still a little confused because, like I said, service dogs don't need certification according to the ADA. A business isn't even legally able to ask for documentation/certification, so saying that a ""certified"" dog can go anywhere makes no sense-- any service dog (assuming it's actually a service dog and not an ESA like you pointed out) can go anywhere with their handler, regardless of its registration status...

Either way, I'm sure Braille is gonna bring her a lot of help and happiness as she grows up!"
"Are you in the US or UK because if so this is not true. As long as the animal is well behaved people have to take the handlers word and even an unregistered service dog can go anywhere with their person. 

Certifications are advised but not required for a full service animal."
"There is no certification of service dogs or ESAs in the US, and there are limits to where a service dog can go. There is no $50 anything for an ESA. Please make sure you’re not spreading all this incorrect information."
I’ve just seen it too much and had enough of it. One of my good buddies is a former Marine that joined in the shit of things in 2003 and his service dog is incredible. His dog plays with our dog and has fun because we’re close and they were both raised together as pups but his dog has been essential for his day to day life and I get real frustrated when people undermine the importance of a Service Dog.
"Proof of training is required should you go to court over a axcess issue.  Basically with a program trained service dog, the program has the responsibility of testifying to the dogs training and giving proof.  For Owner Trained service dogs the owner-trainer would need to show logs and proof of training, such as videos, or pay a 3rd party to assess the dogs training and testify in court.  Both types of training requires the handler to have a doctors note tonl proove disability in a court situation, because the disabled handler is the one with the rights, not the dog.

Otherwise, program trained service dogs and owner trained service dogs are the same under law.  They did this to ensure everyone who needs a service dog to mitigate their disability can have one, because program trained dogs are very expensive and often have a very long waiting list.

As for a dog bite scenario, it would be handled the same for a service dog (program trained or owner trained) or a pet.  If any dog bites, the owner is responsible legally and the dog will be ""punished"" the same as any other.  If a pet dog bites and the local law says any dog that bites is put down, a service dog would also be put down.  And any service dog thay has a bite record, or has been trained in bite work, no longer falls under the protection of the ADA.  Therefore, they are no longer a Service Dog with public access rights.

I highly recommend you familiarize yourself with the laws, you can change terms all you want but the law defines what is and what isn't a service dog, along with what access the are allowed.  The law also is very clear on owner training vs program training and that they are the same.  There are no legal benefits to a program trained service dog, and there is no legal loopholes by calling a dog or service dog by different terms.  And finally, there is no legal benefits, requirements or weight to ""certifications"", for the dog or trainer.  All a ""certification"" does is waste your money and put up huge red flags for anyone who knows the law.  It also directly harms, and makes things harder, for the service dog teams that come behind you.  

If I was you, and I wanted to persue this type of work, or have this dog taken seriously for the sake of the little girl, I would take a huge step back and take the time to really read and familiarize myself with the laws and ethical standards of Service Dogs.  The terms you are using are ruining your credibility and since I assume you are advising the family of the little girl you are training Braille for, it will hurt them when they being working this dog to be spouting incorrect, and illegal, information."
"If a service dog were to display the same behavior as the ESA that bit someone, the service dog handler would be just as liable as the ESA handler. And the ESA (or really any non-service animal in a public space, excluding animal-friendly locations) shouldn’t have been there in the first place since they don’t have public access rights like service animals. Regardless, there’s no “legitimate certifications” for service animals. Owner trained or program trained, they’re all afforded equal status and protection under the law."
"there is no such thing as ESA certified dogs.  in fact there are no such things as certified service dogs or ESAs in the USA.  also, ESAs do not have access in places of business.  

As far as being sued, that is why its important for owners to keep detailed accounts of training done, as well as video proof if possible.  and again  There is no such thing as a certified seeing eye dog"
There is no legitimate certification. Period.
"That's awesome!  Genetics are interesting, especially the recessive ones like this.  Fingers crossed for no skin problems!"
"If OP is in the US, there isn't any legal reason why Braille couldn't be a Guide Dog full time.  Although in school and such the law is a bit different and so usually kids are either accommodated by a person at school (a human guide), or the parents act as the primary handler of the dog.  That is because kids shouldn't be the main responsible party at a young age, all service dogs still need to be handled with skill to maintain their training and manners.  As well as to handle any weird situations that could pop up.  Legally the handler is responsible for keeping their dog under control, no matter what.  And even with all their training, service dogs aren't robots and a child couldn't be expected to completely control a dog 100% of the time.  Teenagers are a different story, but young kids don't have the maturity or strength.  And the other side of the coin is that young kids need to learn how to handle things on their own, it wouldn't be good for them to become too reliant on a service dog because there are always situations where you need to do things on your own.  Such as if the dog is sick or hurt, places that legally can deny a SD, if your SD retires or while your training a new SD."
"Airlines and other stuff of that nature require legit paperwork for service dogs in the US. Like I said earlier, put a service vest on Braille and I highly doubt anyone's gonna question him guiding a legitimate blind girl under 10 years old."
"My mistake, I'm in the US. Here it takes away certain liabilities if the dog has been certified by a trainer to be a service dog. She could put a service dog vest on him and no one's gonna bat an eye at her being blind with a guide dog, but if he were to misbehave or get testy with someone he doesnt like, a business could kick him out."
"It seems I've been miscommunicated to and misinformed to an extent, even though I think I didn't word some things correctly in my statements.  You are right, my mistake."
this is completely incorrect.... the US does not require paperwork for service dogs.  please do your research regarding service dog laws in the US.
"A business could, and should, kick out any misbehaving dog.  Trained by a ""certified"" trainer or not.  There actually isn't even any government run certification for dog trainers either, just certificates of classes passed like a diploma.  Anyone can claim to be a dog trainer, and not all diplomas from classes are equal.  On top of that, there isn't any specfic training or certification for service dog training, which is a whole different ball game then basic pet dog training.  So again, anyone can all themselves a Service Dog trainer.  Experience is a that really matters.  Anyone seeking a trainer should ask for, and check, references.  And for Service Dog trainers or programs, they should also meet and talk to handlers who have dogs trained by that person and varify their track record.  The amount of service dog program scams testify to the fact that a lot of money can be made by preying upon desperate disabled people in need of help.

In the US, under the ADA, there is no registries, certifications or other paperwork for any type of Service Dog.  The ADA does define what a Service Dog is and what qualifies as one.  The proof is in the dogs training and behavior.  Businesses can ask the 2 questions and they must be answered with a appropriate response.  Then the disabled handler is allowed to bring their medical equipment (what Service Dogs are classified as because they mitigate the persons disability, like a white stick) with them into public places.  The disabled person has the right to equal access, the dog is just a tool to get that.  Like wheelchair ramps are required so that a disabled person who uses a wheelchair can have equal access to public places.

For airlines, the law they are under is the ACAA, Air Carrier Access Act and that is a touch different.  The biggest difference is the handler may need a doctors note as proof of a disability that the dog mitigates.  Again, the dog has no rights, it's a dog.  The disabled handler has the right to bring their needed medical equipment with them so that they can access places the same way able bodies people do.  It's about equal access.  

There is additional allowances for Emotional Support Animals under the ACAA and FHA.  Of course it has been wildly abused.  But the wording states a ESA is for a person with a mental health disability that benefits from the animals mere presence.  They have no training or work they preform.  But studies have shown how pets are beneficial for mental health.  So the law states that the persons treating mental health doctor or professional can write a prescription for a pet.  Key word there is Treating, some online ""certificate"" is actually not even legal.  But anyways, ESAs are only allowed in rental houseing that falls under FHA, and for air travel with some additional paperwork and restrictions.  They are not allowed in public places and are not protected under the ADA because they do not have the required task training.  Training is the difference!

As a note, different laws cover different places.  ADA covers public places, with a few exceptions.  ACAA covers air travel and airports.  FHA covers rental housing.  It can be tricky to know the laws, especially with how much misinformation is out there, but it is important to read the law itself or only trust .gov sources when you familiarize yourself with them.

Comment
"Always refreshing to find something we all agree on, even if it's as obvious as animal abuse is wrong."
Good
"Every so often a bill is passed and I'm like ""Wow, I can't believe that wasn't already a felony."" Good job!"
"Whoa, a *federal* felony? Lawyers, that's serious, right?"
Hopefully with this will come increased regulation and enforcement relative to this bill.
Did anyone read the article?
"If you read the article it says this law only prohibits animal cruelty in the form of sending animal torture porn across state lines.

It doesn't make ALL animal abuse a federal crime, only very a specific TYPE of animal abuse."
"This is the first time I've ever heard of animal crushing, holy fuck that's horrendous."
"Hey, that *is* uplifting. Good to see."
This is the way
"> the term ‘animal crushing’ means actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals...is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury 

Ahh, so fisting a cow so it gets pregnant and can produce milk doesn't fall under this category. Makes sense.

/s"
Does it apply to livestock?
The fact that animal crushing videos are even a thing that exists makes me question the future of humanity.
They're rare but it's important for us to acknowledge these few times when Trump does something right.
There should be a subreddit for all the good things trump does... Not that I support him whatsoever but it's just that on Reddit we tend to purely focus on bad things when we hate someone.
Great job! This needed to be done.
"For the first time, he did something right that the whole world can agree on!"
We need to imprison people for obscene amounts of time if they harm animals.
I would love to see this bill applied to factory farms and those fucks caught on video abusing the animals in thier care.

"Unless you’re in a factory farm, then you can expect to be abused."
I... did not expect this. That's actually pretty great
"When you’re right, you’re right"
"I still hate the guy, but at least he something right for once."
Someone tell Tyson and Purdue
Trump has done something good for once
He did something right!!!
While the Kurds are facing ethnic cleansing...  the irony...
So I assume factory farming and dairy is over then?
How about Ag-gag next? Food industry is by far the biggest animal cruelty in the world and yet taking a picture of this cruelty will land you in prison.
"This bill is an extension of a law that specifically forbade people from making crush videos...and only that. 

This article reads like it made it a felony to crush animals using interstate related things. Either the article sucks, the new law sucks or my reading comprehension sucks. 

If this is true, then this bill is weak ass bullshit."
Happy dog noises
I don't agree with Trump on almost everything but good on for signing this.

Good shit.

"Is it just me or are more and more crimes being categorized as felonies?

It just begs the question (for me at least) if every crime eventually becomes a felony then what is the point of making a distinction between felonies and misdemeanors. Just categorize it all as felonies and increase the  punishment on them all."
Nice!
"Something uplifting we can all agree on, thanks to all involved getting this passed!"

You should be surprised how many people are completely fine with animal cruelty as long as it's for food purposes.
"I mean read the bill. It only covers ""animal crushing"" nothing else...."
[removed]
"It is not agreed upon. You reference abuse, the bill cites a very narrow form of cruelty involving crushing animals... I'd this were about straight up animal abuse, the entire meat and dairy industry would disappear"
Yeah but he’s already signed a couple bills that helped kill them easier too. Like making it legal to kill hibernating bears for some reason.
Well this is a backhanded compliment if I’ve ever seen one.
I find it strange that people who operate dog fights get like less than a year in jail.
There are people on my Facebook feed upset because they feel this undermines child abuse. You literally cannot make everyone happy.
Yes! Now let's talk about the meat and dairy industry...
"I totally support this being illegal but honestly this is a continuation of the misuse of the interstate commerce clause. The law itself is incredibly narrow. If you made a crush video and only distributed within the state it wouldn't violate the law. The purpose of the interstate commerce clause is not to regulate morality, it's to ensure the economic unity of the US. I don't agree with this being federal law, it's clearly the domain of state law and every state *should* have a law against it. It got passed because nobody wanted to be the guy ""defending"" crush videos, which are some of the worst shit on the internet.

It's fine if the government is functioning somewhat properly, but what if it wasn't and they decided to illegalize 
""any homosexual acts relating to or involving interstate commerce""? This sort of thing should not be the domain of federal law."
Agreed
hey gamers cleveland here ok so maybe trump doesn't want to be the bad guy anymore bye gamers cleveland out
Lmao like many on here you probably didn’t read the article at all.
No it already was but now it’s a federal felony meaning the federal government can now intervene on what was previously a state issue.
"Most of the time, I'm willing to bet it's due to the difficulty of wording the law. What counts as abuse, what doesn't, etc."
like lynchiing
"Not a lawyer, but I’m pretty sure it’s the biggest."
I'd rather go to a federal prison then a state prison.
I think it means that the federal government can legally get involved in issues that were previously for states to deal with
"A felony is any crime which could be punished by a year or more in prison. Even if you only get sentenced to 5 months, if the potential sentence could have been a year or more, then it's still a felony. Any crime with less than a year total potential jail time is a misdemeanor. 

All felonies are not federal, contrary to what has been stated. The federal government \*generally\* only has jurisdiction in matters that cross state lines (as has been mentioned) or have a nexus with interstate commerce, (meaning commerce involving parties in more than one state).

The federal government can also investigate crimes that do not meet those conditions if a non-federal authority requests federal assistance. This is how most FBI cases come to involve the FBI.

Ironically, you're better off being prosecuted through the federal system than most states (probably all states, but I'm not familiar with 100% of them). Federal sentences are usually shorter than those imposed by state courts - for similar crimes so not terrorism or the like, in which there is no state equivalent. Also, Federal Corrections Institutes (federal prisons) are generally a little nicer, although the downside is that they are all over the country and you may end up further from family. 

Source: I'm an 1811 if you know what that is."
"Yeah so there are federal crimes and state crimes. Every state writes their owns laws and those laws can differ state to state, such as the punishments for speeding. Federal crimes are universal throughout the country, and are prosecuted strictly in the federal courthouses. 

Making animal cruelty a federal crime means that the US government recognizes it as a serious offense and one worth prosecuting. Felonies generally mean the possibility of least a year in prison."
This is mostly a feel good law. Jethro leaving his pitbulls chained up in 115 degree temps with no water isn't a federal issue.
"Sir, this is a reddit"
"Nah, I’m just scrolling until I find someone who did."
"I did and it seems so wildly specific I can't say it will do much. This seems like one of those things politicians do so they can say they did something but they really didn't do much. I hate to be that cynical about it, I'm really glad people can't crush animals while using foreign commerce but I feel like it falls too short of covering even a fraction of animal abuse.

This is straight from the bill according to the article:

It will make it a federal crime for ""any person to intentionally engage in animal crushing if the animals or animal crushing is in, substantially affects, or uses a means or facility of, interstate or foreign commerce,"""
"Or the bill for that matter?

It literally just bans something called “animal crushing” and “animal crush videos”.

No idea what that means at all. Never heard of animal crushing."
"Yep.  It says pretty much what you think.  ""Congress passed it, the president signed it."""
"This needs to be much higher. The article states:
>The bipartisan bill, Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, criminalizes **certain acts** of animal cruelty.

...

>The bill, introduced in the House by Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., is an expansion on the 2010 Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, which made the creation and distribution of ""animal crushing"" videos illegal.
The underlying acts, which were not included in the 2010 bill, are part of the PACT Act.
It will make it a federal crime for ""any person to intentionally engage in animal crushing if the animals or animal crushing is in, substantially affects, or uses a means or facility of, interstate or foreign commerce,"" according to a fact sheet of the bill."
"Yep. And let's not forget, one of Trump's cronies Jo Reitkopp (President/CEO of Make California Great Again) was caught running a puppy mill out of her Orange County mansion back in June. Has yet to face any real justice. [136 dogs were rescued from the 'unliveable', shit-infested mansion. Cited for misdemeanor animal cruelty.](https://lawandcrime.com/crazy/the-smell-was-unbearable-136-dogs-removed-from-california-mansion/)"
"And it's the type the federal government should actually get involved in since it falls under their jurisdiction. 

For example, in my state it'd be pointless to make aggravated animal abuse a federal crime since it already gets you a third degree felony by default."
That's in part because the feds don't generally have criminal jurisdiction over things that happen entirely within a state.
Because that very specific type is the one that only the federal government can prevent. Other forms are taken care of by the states. People always forget how decentralized America is. States literally have as much freedom in America as nations do in the EU.
Yup. TLDR of the bill: No small time animal torturers allowed. Only mass production of torture and only the tasty critters.
This is the first time I’ve seen Trump being painted in a positive light on the front page of Reddit
The Dark Web is full of it.

"*gritty tone* :

"People upvoting this aren't thinking about the animals in factory farms, glad you are tho."
"I agree!

On a totally unrelated note, what did you eat today?"
Including scum in the government authorities who turn animals into weapons
Absolutely nothing.
I'll take a wild guess and say anyone trying to expose animal cruelty in factory farms will be charged with a federal crime if they transport that footage over state lines
"The bill, despite its name, effectively only criminalises acts against ""pets"". It specifically exempts animal agriculture, thus allowing the overwhelming majority of animal cruelty to continue being legal."
"They actually wrote that exemption in. 

Except in the case of usual animal husbandry or something like that."

No they get a blanket exception of course.

This should be the highest comment.
"Fuckin’ lmao, say what you will about that bastard Hitler but he did care about animals, and he killed Hitler!"
Every comment I've seen has been about how this is good and we all agree.....
"Yeah, crushing animals is bad, but a narrow response to a fetish problem in my opinion hardly constitutes a federal animal cruelty law."
"It’s more that it doesn’t encompass most of the animal cruelty issues that people have been bringing up for decades like declawing, keeping animals outside in inclement weather, feeding them garbage and letting them become obese, there are tons of shitty things humans do to animals it doesn’t even talk about."
"congress passed this bipartisianly, it wasn't his administration. Signing bills is literally Trump's job, he has to sign every bill passed.  He gets zero credit for this."
"Why do we have to praise Trump for signing a piece of legislation he had no hand in writing/creating/passing through congress? Because he legit didn't veto it? You do realize he had literally nothing to do with passing this bill outside of just not vetoing it, right? That's praiseworthy?"
"The bill makes it illegal to share videos of animal “crushing”, whatever that means.  I’m not googling it.  As long as they aren’t crushing and distributing videos of it, I don’t think it applies."
Animal cruelty laws really only ever apply to pets.
"to clear things up.. i am not blaming trump or anything.. please dont make it political. This was just aimed at us as a society. I find it hard to understand why animal cruelty bill is not applied to cows, pork etc. It is almost like animal racism."
"""Why are you all still mad about the treason, corruption, pathological lying, and destruction of the norms and morality of our government????? I signed the save-the-puppies bill!  That's a get out of jail free card right?"""

">On the other hand, it's really fucking depressing that ""Don't abuse animals"" is about the most substantive legislation congress will even vote on, let alone pass

Do you mean this specific congress or ever? Because if it's the latter it's simply not true. 

And really only one chamber of the current congress isn't doing their jobs and that's because it's run by a villainous turtle."
This Congress has been passing a lot of bills. It's the Senate blocking passage.
"The senate, not all of congress. The house has passed nearly 400 bills since the last election and not a one of them has even been brought to a vote by good ol’ Moscow Mitch."
The house of reps has voted on and passed a ton of legislation. Unfortunately Mitch McConnell has let it all die before reaching the senate floor so the Republicans can run propaganda ads complaining about Democrats in congress not getting anything passed.
">On the other hand, it's really fucking depressing that ""Don't abuse animals"" is about the most substantive legislation ~~congress~~ The Senate will even vote on, let alone pass

Congress has passed numerous bills that Mitch McConnell has killed in the Senate. The Dems are not the problem here."
"Stop blaming congress, they are deadlocked because we as a nation have very little actual common ground.

It's their job to *find* consensus, not force it."
"Exactly, it fucking kills me the blatant double think and hypocrisy of people jacking themselves off for disliking ""animal cruelty"" while directly and explicitly supporting it every meal they have. It's mind boggling."
"Abuse for personal gratification: not okay.

Abuse for profits: totally okay."
"For real. Reading the post, I’m like “meh”. 

All for show. Hard for many to admit but the real animal abuse goes on continually in factory farming, and many of us support it. 

If you had to kick a goat hard to get milk would you do it? No? Then why support this method of farming..?"
"My parents are in the USDA and this is really true.  USDA got slashed hard this year, and they're pretty much the only thing standing between meat corporations doing whatever tf they want to the animals that come in."
"Not only does it not refer to livestock abuse, it literally only applies to the act of “crushing” an animal. This is an exceedingly narrow response to a niche fetish problem, dressed up ~~here~~ in its title as some sweeping “animal cruelty” bill. 


https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/724/text"
"Yes, but we disagree on the details"
"Sure, but how about if the law is necessary?  The federal government can't regulate animal cruelty locally so they have to rely on the commerce clause:

> ""any person to intentionally engage in animal crushing if the animals or animal crushing is in, substantially affects, or uses a means or facility of, interstate or foreign commerce,"" 

They are out of their scope and this is the best they can do.  So it's basically a feel good law that's being added to the books that will not be independently enforced.  

We can all agree to the rule of law, but can we all agree to keep the legal system as streamlined as possible so it's not out of the reach and understanding of normal people?"
"apologies if you are being sarcastic, but some standard animal agriculture industry practices will put you in jail if you do them to a different species of non-human animal."
"There is, its called the meat industry.  Jot curelty as such, but cruelty as cost cutting."
There's a little bit of money in cock fighting and dog fighting isn't there?? Also a lot of people argue that horse racing is animal abuse.
Depends on your definition. Industry farma arent exactly havens
Have you heard of factory farming?
The animal agriculture industry though (?)
Are you ignoring all fast food and the meat industry as a whole?
"If you ignore the meat, dairy, fur, and such..."
Lol. I’m scared you aren’t being sarcastic and probably stuff your face with factory farmed shit on the daily.
"Uhh, the meat and dairy industries are pretty lucrative."
How about.. the meat and dairy industries?
"If people would acknowledge that in our society, sensory pleasure/taste is valued higher than the life of an animal, then discussion and cultural shifts might happen. The American Dietetic Association states that a well planned vegan diet is healthy and adequate for all stages of life including pregnancy, infancy, childhood, adulthood, the elderly, and athletes. There's no REASON to use animals anymore. Yes I think meat is gross, but I'll admit I remember how good it tasted. Cheese, that stuff's amazing when you don't think about how it got here and what it is. It's not just morally wrong for the animals but for future generations as well. It's destroying the planet. It's not fair to put sensory pleasure above the lives of future generations. We grow enough food to birth, raise, feed, and kill 56 BILLION land animals every year. We're, as a human species, at not even 8 billion right now and have starving regions of the world. There's something wrong here! Even avocados use less water and land than dairy and meat. Palm oil isn't destroying the amazon, cattle feed crops and grazing lands are. This entire group of brainwashed people that couldn't stand to see a dog get abused, but eat pig, one of the most intelligent mammals we know of, are in such a deep hole of cognitive dissonant dichotomy, I don't even have ideas of how to educate anybody. Then there's the idea of HUMANE slaughter. What an oxymoron. Humane's Google-definition is ""having or showing compassion or benevolence"", and the Google-definition of slaughter is ""kill (animals) for food.""... if we have no nutritional need to kill animals for food, and we can't morally justify taste over the life of an animal, then there is no humane way to slaughter an animal that does not want to die, for food. 

Everyone needs to go learn how to cook beans, rice, potatoes, quinoa, broccoli, ect. It's a dying industry. Wake up, folks.

"I understand now, thanks!"
For crush videos - correct? This is not for across the board animal cruelty like the title states?
Actually it was already a felony - in some places. This makes it a felony everywhere.

I’m happy to have mistreatment of any animal be as high of an issue as possible. Someone needs to protect animals and hold horrible people accountable.
Why not? If animals have rights then those rights shouldn't be dependent on what state the animals are in.
It should be though. Hopefully we'll progress to that & other forms of abuse. Baby steps...

Interstate commerce is a jurisdictional hook. The federal government wouldn't have the power to regulate the type of activity without it. That's why there's no federal law against murder. General police power belongs to the states.

"He sits on bills just to spite people for not being far right, I'm honestly surprised he let anything happen with this."
"It took [10 months to get it passed from the first introduction of the Bill to passing by the House and Senate, to the President signing it](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/724/all-info).

[The text of the Law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/724/text)"
I'm not vegan or some crazy animal rights activist but there is absolutely a widespread mistreatment of livestock and farm animals. That definitely needs to be addressed. Especially when there's videos of stupid teens blowing up pigs or beating cows for no reason. This bill doesn't really cover agricultural and farm animals as extensively as it addresses pets.
"Looks like all it covers is the creation of a video involving animal cruelty. Not the cruelty itself, only the making of a video depicting it."
every bill needs some sort of hokey makeshift patriot name to get a vote.
So cock fighting is in?
"The free market must be allowed to flourish. How else will the wealth trickle down to us ordinary poor folk, if animals can't be flagrantly abused any more?"
While I completely agree that “the real animal abuse” is happening in factory farms don’t you think you’re being a bit dismissive of what the law covers? Like you can have different laws for different things. Would you disregard a climate change law because it does nothing for factory farming? Why can’t we just be happy with a small win and then work for more?
"""‘animal crushing’ means actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 and including conduct that, if committed against a person and in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would violate section 2241 or 2242);""

edit: it even includes if you make an animal sick.. like why not actually read the bill before you talk about it only responding to a ""niche fetish problem""

edit 2: nvm, making it sick is only bodily injury not serious bodily injury and thus not subject to this bill. But either way it doesn't only cover ""crushing"""
That small detail being the constitution
The details shouldn’t involve human cruelty.
And farm animals are specifically exempted from this bill for that reason.
"I think that was his (sarcastic) point, just a friendly btw"
"Look up how Halal and Kosher meat is processed. It's just about the most barbaric way you can process an animal. In a normal process, the cow (or other large animal) is shot in the head while standing up in a relatively stress free environment. 

Although halal and kosher slaughter varies slightly, the process is very similar. With them, the cow is tied and hung upside down by it's back legs. Then, it's throat is cut and it slowly bleeds out. It tries to moo for help, although no sound comes out. An incision is made on the back of it's neck and a rod is jammed in it to paralyze him/her. While still very much alive and able to feel pain, but completely paralyzed, they start to skin them. At some point during the skinning/processing, the cow dies. But that doesn't matter since the end result of paralysis is the same as death to them. 

Some countries have banned ritualistic slaughter of any kind, although most have not. Anytime a country tries, it's instantly labeled as antisemitic. Also, excess meat is sent over to the regular side of the beef isle."
Rodeos are also pretty fucked
"I think he was being sarcastic. Otherwise, commercial laboratories maim and sacrifice tens of thousand of animals a day at a minimum."
How many powerful people are into cock fighting?
They're animal cruelty plain and simple. Whether that's the hill you die on or not is your choice. And no I'm not vegan because it's not the hill I die on. I have other hills with other important things.
"Huh?  What meat. Dont you dare attack my comfort zone.

Back to my  organic, free roaming, humanely slaughtered cooked up corpse. Side of celery should make it look healthy and complete."
Fucking well said. But don't expect people to listen about actually having a discussion. I expect your comment to be downvoted into oblivion since reddit hates vegans as much as confronting the consequences of their own actions.

"The moment it hits the internet, it's interstate, there doesn't need to be any actual commerce involved in the crime, when it goes up on Facebook it's interstate commerce as far as the feds go"
Hopefully this will effect dog fighting that crosses state lines. I hope this also affects puppy & kitten mills where sellers are transporting animals across state lines to buyers.
"Also I doubt it will apply to the 10,000 dogs unnecessarily killed by police every year [according to the DoJ](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2018/jun/16/doj-police-shooting-family-dogs-has-become-epidemic/)"
I'm guessing any interstate is a given there.
"Exactly. This still doesn't stop puppy Mills that just operate in your state. It's a great start, but we need state governments to get on board. They won't because livestock farmers are worried animal rights bills will cut into their profits and they lay your state senators (at least in ag states.)"
If you’re profiting from animal cruelty you deserve to be taken apart piece by piece with tin snips
No problem.
"That’s not actually how it works, this guys more on the mark: https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/e1p8qo/_/f8r46ol/?context=1"
I'm 90% sure my rep is on board with this but they have bigger fish to fry right now in the House
What about bird law?
Well that depends on who is enforcing that law.
Nobody enforces international law
Except international law isn’t *really* a thing
International law means nothing
Only if you're not from America
Funny you mention that I was just watching his stories about prison and I have never agreed more with someone than when he had the same sentiment. My dad has been in federal prison and my cousin in state prison and they both agree with this too. State prison fuckin suuuuucks

"I appreciate the effort because it's not your fault, but that segment still doesn't explain at all what this bill does."
"I know mob justice is generally frowned upon, but can we make an exception for this crushing bullshit?"
Will this apply to crushing male baby chicks in poultry farms?
"It's not a federal issue because the Constitution generally doesn't give federal government power over issues that don't cross state lines, not necessarily because it isn't serious."
"All 50 states already have felony animal abuse charges.

The language of the bill specifically states that it only pertains to “animal crushing in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce"". Animal crushing, oddly enough, is defined as basically any harm to the animal.

So, again, Karen leaving her chi-weenie in her Lexus is not a federal issue, as it does not cross state lines. Karen certainly should be charged under her state's animal cruelty laws, but it's not a federal issue.

You might see a few folks get charged with this if it's something like animal smuggling or things like that, but your garden variety animal abuse is not going to be covered under the law. I suppose it could also be used against someone harming animals on federal property, such as a national park. However, animal cruelty will overwhelmingly be a local or state issue."
"The United States Federal Government has a ton of resources and is more powerful than any state or organization on the planet.

But it maintains its power under a condition of deferring responsibility to the states to administer their own part of society.

When it encroaches on all facets of American life just because all commerce has become interstate commerce over the last 90 years it really stretches the tolerance of its constituents. Like ""hmm okay it makes sense for you to be the glue between the states and that made sense in 1790 but now you are using that privilege to dictate all the states, except when you're being nice and remember to write an exception for intrastate behavior""

Of course, nothing is going to happen, and it has the ability to completely suppress and sanction any individual state (look up how alcohol drinking age was uniformly raised to 21), but do understand why people may agree with the concept of a law, but disagree with which government is used to create the law.

This is why its not hypocritical to do things like pass universal healthcare in a state, but be opposed to the same implementation in the federal government like Mitt Romney was, because they are simply different governments with different constitutions and constituents."
The point here isn't necessarily about animal rights; it's also about the danger that animal abusers likely pose to other people.

"Man, I'm glad a law like that is on the books, but just reading it made me sick."
"Ok. Im sorry but ""animal crushing."" That's like a nickname or euphemism for something other than what it sounds like, right? The text mentions animal crushing videos and i feel nauseous and am not sure if it means what i think it might mean."
That's it? Animal crushing? I mean its a step in the right direction but there's more to animal abuse than just crushing.
It specifically exempts farm animals iirc
I’m a meat eater and I agree. Animals shouldn’t be tortured just because they’re raised to feed us.
Anyone who would demonstrate that level of cruelty to an animal is a threat and danger to society. Lock em up
Trump has done the exact opposite of helping those animals: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-allows-pork-slaughterhouses-have-fewer-usda-inspectors-n1055451
"It sounds crazy, I think, only because it's not ""normal"". But consider this- we all think animal abuse is wrong, but don't think too much about the systematic, institutionalised abuse of farm animals. My rule of thumb is - if I'm not okay with my dog having to go through it, I'm not okay with that happening to any farm animal on my behalf. It's really not that crazy, it's just values you had all along."
Cool. It’s a step in the right direction.
"That's largely a Federalism issue.  The actual act would almost always have no effect on Commerce and thus be a state issue, unless it occurs in an agricultural setting.

Videos are shared on the web which gives it multi-state contacts."
"So wait.  It would cover a whistle blower making video of an abuse, but not the abuse itself?  If so, no wonder it passed.."
"did you know the patriot act allows banks to decide if you're in violation, and they can close your bank account on that decision?"
"More importantly, fuck all the Republicans that continue to vote for him as Senate Majority Leader, so that he can block bills for them. He's a figurehead meant to absorb criticism that's been deflected away from the rest of the GOP.

His job is to uphold GOP corporate interests by blocking sensible bills, so that the rest of the GOP doesn't have to look bad by having to vote (on record) against policies that benefit the American people. He's their shield.

McConnell is like TicketMaster. His objective is to draw the hatred of the American people by being the singular bad guy, so that all other GOP members can still profit without having to look bad for fucking over their constituents."
Seems reasonably broad to me...  I’m not up on the specifics of animal abuse issues but that seems to encompass a decent amount
But being vegan isn't a hill to die on. For most people it's a material trivial lifestyle change.
Um actually my uncle's brother's sister's dog works on a factory farm and I'll have you know they treat the cows very well. They sleep in their own beds and whisper lovingly into their ears as they bring the bolt gun out.

Something something own the libs
This act only addresses the actual act of animal abuse. Videos or photos of animals abuse were already addressed in a similar piece of 2010 legislation. Kind of a flimsy usage of the commerce clause honestly
"Thank you Wickard v. Filburn, a decision I think is totally nuts from a legal perspective but would not ~~undue~~ undo if given the opportunity."
It applies to animal crushing.
"It doesn't. Just to the very narrow act of ""crushing"" an animal."
I did a triple take at the author’s name before finally realizing it was written by *Dale* Chappell. (Not *Dave*)
"Oh, thank you!"
"Oh yeah, I agree. I'm sure it'll eventually pass but getting it done unanimously in the Senate was a bigger deal."
Clearly bird law is the biggest
Bird law > International law
I'll take you toe to toe in bird law
The title is feel good clickbait. Animal abuse is a felony! Well certain kinds anyway. The specific kind of animal abuse that leads up to an already illegal type of animal abuse but the original bill left out due to a loophole.
"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/724/text

This is the entire bill. It's one page, it covers animal crushing and distribution of video depictions. Half of the page is exemptions, such as medical/scientific research, and slaughter for food/animal management/accidental crushing. 

It's not really all that exciting, it's more like, ""Why hadn't this been a felony before?"""
"The bill is meant to stop animal abuse fetish porn - specifically 'crushing,' where someone will crush an animal to death beneath heels or whatever."
"If we’re talking interstate commerce, could this extend to agricultural livestock?"
Interstate commerce is a jurisdictional hook. The federal government wouldn't have the power to regulate the type of activity without it. That's why there's no federal law against murder. General police power belongs to the states.
Is that a pawn shop meme?
They added something to exclude all animal processing in any form as far as I know. Because of course they do.
"No, the bill itself is pretty short. [Here is the full text.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/724/text)

The relevant section is:

>“(d) Exceptions.—

>“(1) IN GENERAL.—This section does not apply with regard to any conduct, or a *visual depiction of that conduct,* that is—

>“(B) the slaughter of animals for food;"
"Oh man a classic case of ""did you read it"" by someone who didn't read it."
"Ya know, I remember hearing about that back when those videos were being made, and I specifically remember having no desire whatsoever to find out if the videos actually existed, due to the fear of what I might see if they *did* exist and I managed to find them."
"Why the fuck does the definition of ""crushing"" include a bunch of shit that isn't crushing?"
">“(1) the term ‘animal crushing’ means actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 and including conduct that, if committed against a person and in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would violate section 2241 or 2242);

It's more than just crushing. Basically all those people who make those sick videos of animal tortures can be put in prison now."
"The only real argument against it is that it’s already illegal under state laws, so there’s no need for federal legislation. However, the reason the federal law is needed is because many states just give a slap on the wrist for animal cruelty."
Jfc who the hell is crushing animals?! Psychopaths. Absolutely wild this needed a law at all.
In what capacity would crushing an animal be a part of Euthanasia? Or am I reading the bill wrong?
It takes a long time for our government to pass a law but that's a feature not a flaw
Dont ever subject yourself to it. Forget it exists.
"It gets worse, it's even a fetish. Like women with heels stepping on and killing animals. So they get paid to do it, and people pay to watch it, and there's enough out there to make it its own market.

Learning about the world gets more and more awful the older you get. And r/upliftingnews never fails to depress me!"
Animal crushing videos were why this bill was submitted.
"“(1) the term ‘animal crushing’ means actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 and including conduct that, if committed against a person and in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would violate section 2241 or 2242);

It's more than just crushing. Basically all those people who make those sick videos of animal tortures can be put in prison now. And yeah it makes me sick as well that there are people out there like this."
"The text explains what it means and yes it does include actual crushing, though more generally covers anything that causes bodily harm. Its horrific, I had no idea there was a market for this. But remember this doesnt make it illegal to grind baby chickens because it's part of an industrial process."
"it’s not limited to just “crushing” as you would think.  
from the bill:
“the term ‘animal crushing’ means actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury”"
"I don't know why but crushing is the catch-all term they chose for killing an animal in an inhumane manner

it's possible that it's because crushing is the most common. millions of chicks are crushed in chicken farms every day"
"Makes no sense, the cognitive dissonance people have when it comes to abusing ""pet"" animals vs abusing farm animals is crazy. If dogs and cats were treated like animals in factory farms there would be so much immediate outrage"
"Unfortunately, there isn't a way to produce animal products at scale to meet current demand in a way that isn't cruel. That's the only reason we have cheap meat- extremely efficient industrialized farming. Standard industry practices are sickening, please do look into it and decide if it's something you want to support. We can, after all, be perfectly healthy on plant based diets, as agreed upon by the major dietetic associations in the world."
">did you know the patriot act allows banks to decide if you're in violation, and they can close your bank account on that decision?

It also allows for the revocation of citizenship based on **suspicion** of being involved in terrorism, even if unsubstantiated."

The commerce clause is one of the most overused excuses the Fed has used to regulate.
"Look up some dog shooting in the news, or worse (if you want to be depressed), on youtube. There's an epidemic of it and cops are never punished for it. In fact it's pretty much standard procedure to shoot a dog if it approaches you, even if the cops aren't supposed to be there.

Google ""cop shoots dog"" and you'll read about thousands of examples. And nothing ever happens to the cop."

"Yeah, the take away, from my perspective, is THIS is the kind of legislation that McConnell will allow through in the ""Don Nothing""/""Protect Trump"" senate?  This is, at best, fluff legislation that does nothing, yet somehow comes to the floor despite GOP gridlock."
I can neither confirm nor deny details of any such operation without the secretary's approval.
If they have to specifically exlude animal processing does that not prove that they find animal processing to be animal crushing?
You might want to read some more actual bill language. It's often quite interesting
Who the hell is making videos like that and worse who is watching. If I ever see someone remotely hurting an animal or child it makes my head explode. Like are you so impotent that you have the hurt something defenseless.

"At some places in the chicken industry, once a chick is sexed and determined to be male, they ""discard"" it. This involves placing them on a conveyor belt that sends them to be ground up and disposed of."
"I’m in one of the most redneck states there are, and it’s a felony here with stiff minimum sentences. 


Granted it was to deter cock fighting, but that’s perspective on how redneck we are. Also in my town it’s illegal to chain your dog up. Hell yea!!

Any state behind us should be ashamed."
Despite the fact that it's a solid predictor of more serious issues with violent behavior.
Most of the crush videos and other animal cruelty/beastilaity poarn is made in foreign countries. A federal law makes it easier to go after such people
The crazy part is that their is demand for it it’s not just one sicko crushing poor little animals they’re thousands willing to pay for a video of said crushing. Some people really are monsters and I’m glad that something is finally happening about it.
"Well for one, that's how you usually euthanize small birds. Thorassic compression: you kind of cradle them in your hands and press against their chest with your thumbs."
Sacrificing lab animals is done via cervical dislocation sometimes.
It sounds like the law specifically names what counts as euthanasia--specifically painless and distress-free death.
"Because sometimes animals need to be put down.  They can still be killed on video if it's legitimately euthanizing them.

I would guess that exception would be designed to apply to instructional videos that use real depictions of how vets and techs should do it."
People joke but that is the exact feature that prevents dictator from dismantling democracy.
Hey that kinda rhymes
"I get every fetish, on some level, except for this. I don’t get this, or like where it would come from."
"Well, with at least one of those women, Anonymous doxxed her and got her fired and (if I remember correctly) arrested"
Would that wording make those machines where they throw live baby chickens in to a grinder illegal??
"Yes, there IS a sizeable market for people who experience a high, a thrill, a notetably SEXUIAL high watching baby animals beaten, stabbed, and in the case of ""Crush Videos"", tiny, baby kittens, puppies, hamsters or any small, newly-born animals, are stopped, crushed to death to a sick group of persons who pay big money for this.

Likely found on the dark internet, along with other vile, ugly practices. Remember, these are deeply damaged individuals, who get sexual gratification in seeing helpless baby animals sadistically and cruelly destroyed.

This law is so overdue, yet this kind of mental depravity has sadly been with humans since the beginning.

Sorry for the graphics, some simply cannot concieve that a human could stoop so low. May God-damn the monsters behind this."

"Probably not ,those are usually just instant death. Even animal rights activists don't say that it causes suffering when they go after it, they usually just say it's unethical to kill them."
"It's like someone being in a car accident where their head is crushed and they die instantly. Makes for a gruesome, horrendous visual, but it's far more important that the death was humane than that the death looks pretty. I'd certainly much rather die in a way that's painless and ugly than torturous and pretty."

She froze and struggled and tramped through the night for idiot sheep that never said thank you and would probably be just as stupid tomorrow, and get into the same trouble again. And she did it because not doing it was unthinkable.

There had been the time when they met the pedlar and the donkey in the lane. It was a small donkey and could hardly be seen under the pack he'd piled on it. And he was thrashing it because it had fallen over.

Tiffany had cried to see that, and Granny had looked at her and then said something to Thunder and Lightning...

The pedlar had stopped when he heard the growling. The sheepdogs had taken up position on either side of the man, so that he couldn't quite see them both at once. He raised his stick as if to hit Lightning, and Thunder's growl grew louder.

'I'd advise ye not to do that,' said Granny. He wasn't a stupid man. The eyes of the dogs were like steel balls. He lowered his arm. 'Now throw down the stick,' said Granny. The man did so, dropping it into the dust as though it had suddenly grown red-hot.

Granny Aching walked forward and picked it up. Tiffany remembered that it was a willow twig, long and whippy.

Suddenly, so fast that her hand was a blur, Granny sliced it across the man's face twice, leaving two long red marks. He began to move and some desperate thought must have saved him, because now the dogs were almost frantic for the command to leap.

'Hurts, don't it,' said Granny, pleasantly. 'Now, I knows who you are, and I reckon you knows who I am. You sell pots and pans and they ain't bad, as I recall But if I put out the word you'll have no business in my hills. Be told. Better to feed your beast than whip it. You hear me?'

With his eyes shut and his hands shaking, the man nodded.

'That'll do,' said Granny Aching, and instantly the dogs became, once more, two ordinary sheepdogs, who came and sat either side of her with their tongues hanging out.

Tiffany watched the man unpack some of the load and strap it to his own back and then, with great care, urge the donkey on along the road. Granny watched him go while filling her pipe with Jolly Sailor. Then, as she lit it, she said, as if the thought had just occurred to her:

**'Them as can do, has to do for them as can't. And someone has to speak up for them as has no voices.'""**"
"I wish. He missed the court date, so police went to his house to serve a bench warrant and he had meth on him so he went to jail for that charge but since its only a low level felony he got out on $1000 bond"
"Thanks, I try."
"Yup.. on another subreddit they were talking about a girl that was trapped in debris and mud for 36 hours before finally dying.. while reporters were interviewing her and everything (the location couldn't get the equipment it needed).I said why the fuck did nobody offer her a bullet. Spoiler alert I was downvoted for ""being cruel"" but I would argue that leaving a poor girl to slowly die trapped up to her neck in mud is far more cruel. Or that cave diver that got trapped upside down for 24 hours in pitch black in agonizing pain while stuck in a tiny hole.. like dude kill the poor bastard why are you leaving a human being to suffer."
I'm really not super sure what op was suggesting. I checked out a bunch of monkey videos. No interesting comments.
"That's because your noodle's kinky, not deranged. We have standards here."
I support their executions by puppy spike trap 100%. Both my formal and my internet self agrees on this
"It's in the Philippines apparently. He's a kid with mental issues living with his parents. The youtube channel ""The Quartering"" has a piece on him."
Okay that's it I'm reading all of Terry Pratchett.
Yo props for this gem. Underrated as sin in my opinion. It fits so perfectly in her.
"I just re-read the Tiffany Aching trilogy (the first three, rather). I'm so thankful that I was able to have Pratchett's writing in my life. His passing hurt because it symbolized the loss of such an amazing voice of wisdom (in his own, inimitably satiric way)."
Love Tiffany aching!!!! My favorite of the series by Terry pratchett
Hey! Did you just trick me into reading??
"One of my favorites along those lines, from Unseen Academicals:

>“...one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you'll agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged onto a half submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters, who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen. Mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that is when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.”"
What Terry Pratchett book is this from? I need to knowwwwww
thank you for introducing me to these wonderful books!
Gonna get that last quote as a tattoo.
GNU Terry Pratchett
"I'm rarely the fellow the advocate for vigilantism, but at some point someone needs to do something to defend the defenseless."
Sounds like a delightful person.
Maybe he'll OD. That would be cool.
Comment
People who say soda is better are the entire circus actually.
"Scientifically water has no flavor

what's mixed in with the water is the taste"
"Water has no taste, that's what make it so good. Just pure unaltered hydration."
The temperature of water is what decides it’s taste
">""I don't drink water""  
>  
>picture of dead body"
my water tastes like shit because the britta filter doesn't fuckin' work
I only like crunchy water
Water does have a flavour though.
Just add a slice of lemon to water and its *AMAZING*
i don't like the taste of some waters so that's forgiven but that's nO REASON NOT TO BE ONE WITH THE WATER
"Hey, that looks like me. But I do drink me a lot of water"
"Sprite cranberry is a solid maybe, but you're on thin ice"
Cold water is so fucking good
Water tastes like water
Water tastes crispy
Bro. My friend gave me a ride to the bus stop one morning. The sun wasnt even up. He just woke up. And the first thing he drank was a fking soda...
"So...





Is water wet?"
"In all seriousness, I actually like soft drinks but who the fuck prefers them over water? Like, it's actually **water**. I don't understand"
"Soda tastes better, but is nutritionally inferior to water."
Water has no flavor but taste fucking amazing. Especially after moderate exercise.
"Not relevant, but the dude in the format looks like William Blazkowicz from the Wolfenstein series"
"""water has no flavour""

""water taste like shit""

Non-water drinkers with small brain"
Depends on where your at also. I notice some towns water tastes different than others. I filter my water then drink it.
Are you guys okay with water flavoring?
"Tap water does taste like shit so pt.3 may have some merit.

But you filter it, not drink soda instead."
"Soda melts your teeth, stomach and oesophagus. But sure, carry on drinking literally ACID."
">These guys probably never drank water

Sounds like the title of a Buzzfeed video starring that dude who has never eaten fruits or veggies before trying water for the first time."
I think whatever I'm eating has its flavor enhanced by water. Maybe because it's a palette cleanser?
do such heathens really exist?
"These people have never truly had thirst. 

I mean the medical version of dehydration. 

They aren't craving a cool can of Cuke. They want water. And ice. And more ice. 

These guys need to reset those thingies called ""tongues"" and recognize the real super power is water!"
Most water does taste bad. Thats a fact. Unless you like ocean water.
They just need their sugar fix.
I drink squash best stuff ever just fruit flavours water.
Ngl water just tastes like chemicals
"Nah, the entire circus is people that say ""There's still water in soda so my kidneys aren't ruined"""
"Idk man.

I'll always stand by water, and I drink it 99% of the time, but sometimes you want some actual flavours and a sweet hit.

That's not to say its better, but it's enjoyable in moderation like all things."
"That's because water is the basic foundation of all (drinkable) liquid, so you're right when you say it has no flavor because it's essentially the base.

Water still has a ""taste"" tho. It tastes like the fckn nectar of the gods."
Mmmmmmmmmminerals
I wonder if distilled water has taste. I've never been brave enough to try. I just use it for steaming the floor.
Yes it does it’s temperature is it’s flavour.
Waters taste is it’s temperature
Not true when ur hella thirsty it tastes like “aw hell yea”
Also if you’re at home or not.
The temperature will decide your fate.
Rip
"Oh lemons are okay, but my ^(90% corn syrup) Arizona Green TEA doesn't cut it HUH. ITS JUST LEAVES AND WATER ^(for that 10%)

*Continues laughing to themselves in diabetus*"
Would an orange work?
In pretty sure the rating you're looking for is aluminum water
Sprite cranberry is the only soda accepted
"""Every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes."""
"There's water in ocean water, why don't they try drinking it?"
Lol
"I tried it once, all I remember is that it had a slightly metallic taste. Of course, this was after I'd accidentally gotten some NaOH in my mouth at the chem lab, so that might have affected the taste."
"I drink distilled water all the time, I prefer it"
Home water tastes 25% more water than the leading brand name water.
Yeah a guess it could never tried orange but have used lemon and/or lime.
"Definitely works, so do strawberries!"
yes you're sure
"""LOL, I'm not a fish, bruh""

-Dehydrated idiot, probably."
"Cuz it’s not loaded with sugar, duh"
"""Lol"" ~ u/cappedan, 1842-present"
Mmmm tastes like an exothermic reaction.
"Is this a joke? Distilled water is totally not safe to drink, am i getting woooshed?"
Then there’s unfiltered school water......
Reduced cognitive function is a symptom of dehydration.
"Uhh, distilled water is completely safe to drink, it’s just not as beneficial because it lacks minerals"
"That's not true at all. If it were unsafe, sailors would be dead."
"At one point, my high school's water was straight yellow. It was a dark time"
Sailors compensate low mineral content with regulated diets. Also the majority of ships do not supply their own water through a purifier. I believe that's more of an aircraft carrier/navy thing.
Comment
In 2003 I made my first email address and it starts with “ctrrocks.” I still use this email address.
"Thank you from the mom of a six year old boy who has never played these games but for some unknown reason loves drawing and coloring characters from miscellaneous video game series, currently super jazzed to draw Crash and Sonic like 5x per day on the low end. It would break my heart if someone crushed his spirit via an ""okay but do you even play (this specific) game featuring Character??!!?!?"" 
Because no, he doesn't. We're poor. But he thinks the design is cool and he enjoys drawing them and damn whoever breaks that beautiful spirit."
I forgot the titans games existed... woah. That brought back MEMORIES
"Emphasis on *enjoy*, not necessarily *played*"
">even just crash bash

I've played most of the games and crash bash is easily the most fun I've had. Does it usually get a bad rap?"
Titans that good shit
"I love Crash of Titans and Mind over Mutant.

Fight me."
The only crash game I owned before adulthood was crash team racing. That shit was super fun tho and I still like playing it
"Crash Bash is the only title in the franchise I played.

The nostalgia is strong."
The opening song of crash bash still occasionally pops into my head
I played the hell out of that Crash/Spyro cross over game for the gba.
What if I don’t care about Crash Bandicoot at all but really fucking love Jak and Daxter?
"You're not a true fan if you don't jerk off to porn of him, cowards"

"Well, my user name is loosely based on Doctor N. Gin and the only game in the series I like is crash team racing. So \*Dab*."
What if I just think it's badass that Naughty Dog wrote the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter games in Lisp?
"Did this man just ""just"" Crash Bash?"
Huge fan here....what’s clash handorboot?
"I had a playstation with crash bandicoot and no save cartridge, I spent many weekends trying to finish the game in one go.

The phrase, ""honey, the guests are here, you need to turn off the playstation"" still haunts me"
[Same guy](https://youtu.be/aRsOBFhNjVM)
"I’ve never played any of the games, but I like bandicoots."
"I literally pulled hair of my head trying to get all the gems back in 95. I was about to do it again with the collection on switch but my wife hit me.... I hope crash is in smash so I can hurt him like ....I ...hurt....me...playing...him...getting....  
hurt..."
"Technically, this is still gatekeeping"
I like ooh guh da buh
"The only crash game I’ve played is Crash Nitro Cart and I loved it even though I suck at racing games. I didn’t know until years later that there were other games, especially platformers! It wasn’t until the N-sane trilogy came out did I realize I missed out on a lot of shit. 

Maybe I’ll buy it one day."

This guys Crash Bandicoot YTP’s are amazing.

I used to play crash bandicoot on The OG PlayStation when I was like 7. Back then we were like super poor so the PlayStation was like a huge deal. I’ll always have a special place in my heart for ole crash.
What domain
"Bro ctr was the shit! I played the hell out of that game, as well as the motorcycle levels on crash bandicoot warped. Man those are some good memories."
"My first email address was ""cortexbrio"" named after my favorite villians"
CTR is better than Mario Kart fight me
Hell yeah it is.
"Tell your kiddo they are awesome and to keep drawing if they enjoy it!! Even if they don't know the character, they can like how the character looks and wanna draw them anyways! I hope no one ever crushes your kiddos spirit! <3"

"This started out wholesome, but... that username though..."
"Unfortunately I can't gift you a system for him to play on, but I have an unused key for the [N.Sane Trilogy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/731490/Crash_Bandicoot_N_Sane_Trilogy/) on Steam that I'd be happy to PM you if have (or have access to) a PC that meets the minimum requirements."

"Check out buzzfeed's animator vs cartoonist draw-off videos. Maybe he can watch those for even more fun inspiration. But maybe check first if the content of what they say to each other is appropriate because I watch those as an adult and my parents also never cared about what I saw on TV.

But check it out, maybe when he's a bit older he can have an amazing time looking for things to draw from those videos. They also do mashups of cartoons/comics/video games. You watch them draw and they talk about their jobs."
Man crash of the titans was my favorite game for a LONG time
"It's the only one of them I actually owned, but from what I've seen on youtube it's very different in structure than everything else."
"It gets a bit of a bad rep for basically being mario party, though I enjoy immensely more than the latter especially with the Co-op adventure. My brother and I sunk so many hours into that"
"Crash Bash has been the default party game for myself and my cousins when we meet up once a year, for the last 15 years or so.

I will defend that game to the death. I don't know whose death, but there will be death."
100 bro titans the only mf i played. no regrets
Emulators my dude.
"Because there's a lot of assholes who say there are a fan of something without actually ever experiencing that thing.

Like loving Metallica but never listened to Metallica"
You could have played it in uncharted 4 and not known it was a real thing and also been a fan...
Titans that good shit
"Ctr was the one game I played every so often with my dad, each of us had their favourite race tracks, I loved the sewers one. Good times :)"
Humble Bundle? Wanted Spyro?  :)
"You still played it. Even if you didn’t know it’s real. What I mean is, you at least have to have seen the game to be a fan of it, if someone asks you if you’re a fan of Crash Bandicoot and you didn’t even know what that person is talking about and say yes, you’re not really a fan of that thing."

Yep haha.

They kinda did. It’s on the PS4. They added more levels and polished it for new gen.

Damn it if it didn’t become his favorite toy. That was three years or so ago and, coincidentally, I finally replaced it today. It’d come apart in a few places and he’d eaten one of the connecty pieces at one point but it had to have been the most durable toy he’s ever had."

My in-laws had a lab that liked to pull the stuffing out of toys so I got one of these and stuffed it full of fleece scraps and strips cut from an old t-shirt. She loved pulling all of the bits out and then it was easy to stuff them all back inside for another round.
"These are great to use..

Really? What brand are you buying? I've bought these and twice he has ripped it apart within a few hours.
Another vote for these being great. We have three dogs plus a rotating foster that have gone through a couple of these. Definitely need to get another.
This is my puppy's favorite toy. He destroys every other toy I've given him.
"My pup loves hers too! Hers is bright green, and it only recently started falling apart. Took 4 years, the longest any toy lasted her.


I need to replace it because I think she's losing her mind without it but I don't want her eating any of the bits or trying to rip it apart more. I'll get the exact same one.


We've used it as a kong-like treat dispenser a few times too with large treats."

I had a golden retriever that chewed up a frisbee while we were gone. Noticed he wouldn't poop for little over a day. He would squat but nothing came out. Day two we took him in and he swallowed a piece of frisbee. Plugged his poop shoot. Got it all fixed. He was a champion.

Yep. It's censored nudes in the format of such bubbles. That can't be a fetish unless you've got a messed up history or some weird thing happened to you.
"Well no, bubbling is taking non-nude photos and making them *appear* as if they’re censored nudes.

A lot of people use it to make their own fantasies for people they know. It’s a bit weird and a lil on the creepy side but I guess it doesn’t hurt anyone and I don’t kink shame"
"Lol, I see. That's an interesting idea, though why the bubbles."
The curvature a bunch of circles provide is easy to line up with the bodies that they’re bubbling over. Also allows them to give it more of an artistic look which generally helps in fooling the brain (as opposed to simply bubbling over ONLY the sensitive bits)
"Some of them look naked to me, the majority."
"That’s because some people go the extra mile and blur the skin tones over the bathing suits to make it appear as though they’re wearing nothing. You see that a lot with the semi-transparent ones.

"For a long time I thought ""to bust a nut"" meant that you were going to kick a guy in the balls or beat him up. So anytime I was getting worked up or angry talking about some guy I would say "" I'm going to bust his fucking nut"" not knowing the real meaning. Nobody ever said anything but it was always followed by my friends laughing so I assumed it was because I was being dramatic.

Years go by and my coworker is telling me about some rude person he met and I said ""you should definitely bust that guy's nut"", to which he paused and said ""do you even know what that means?""
Suffice to say I was extremely embarrassed and horrified when he explained it to me."

He actually returned it and got a new one thinking it was broken, since the “timer” is just a brief sort of pause/reduction in the vibration. He would be like “wtf I literally just charged this fucking thing” thinking that the battery was already dying. One day, and I can’t remember exactly what the conversation was, I brought up how I liked that my toothbrush let me know when I had brushed long enough, and it was like a lightbulb went off in his head and suddenly he put it together that *that* was what his toothbrush was doing all along."

I felt they were okay earphones, not the best, but they pretty good sound quality and decent noise cancellation.

2 years ago we took a bus up to Minnesota to visit a friend for a few days. We chose the late bus so we could just sleep during the 8 hours it would take us to get there. We're getting settled and I see him pull out his earphones, which were the same as mine, and put them on [like this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--pKPRT7pdPg/Tcir5pRCHaI/AAAAAAAAABM/AG-t-WUcEVM/s1600/hj_SE215CL%2528right%2529.jpg) over the ear. I never wore them like that. I just kind of jammed them in a way they fit, [a bit like how you see here](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDHVTUi38J8/maxresdefault.jpg). I asked him about wearing them like that and he said, ""What do you mean? That's how you're supposed to wear them. How do you wear them?"" I showed him how I typically wore them and he laughed and said, ""Wearing them the right way gets a better seal for the sound.""

I still wore them my way, until he fell asleep and then I decided to give his way a chance. HOLY SHIT it made such a huge difference. The sound was better, they felt more comfortable, and they were so much better at cancelling out noise. When we got to the first stop I told him, ""Why the hell didn't you tell me I was wearing them wrong for so many years?! This is so much better!"" He told me I should have read the manual, but in my defense I didn't think I had to read the manual for a pair of ear buds.

Hi Dwight
"This jogged my memory of something.  When I was around 13, I was on a flight with a bunch of other kids.  I fell asleep during the flight, but woke up during some turbulence.  A couple kids near me saw me wake up startled and made a big show of saying ""whoa, I cant believe the pilot did a barrel roll.""  A few other people I talked to about it, confirmed it, and it took me embarrassingly far into adulthood to realize some people were just messing with me.  I mean, a pilot on a commercial flight wouldnt do that.... right?"

There's an episode of Friends where they make fun of Ross for believing the family dog went to libe on a farm ..... I watched the show with mu wife a few years ago.... Ross and I came to the same cruel realization at the same time
"I realised a similar thing about our dog. Mom told me theyd given him to an older couple without any kids, but I asked last year and got her to admit hed been put down.

He had bitten my brother in the face, and *shook* him. 

Of COURSE theyd had to have him put down.

He was very very old by that point and had lived a very good life with us."

"More interesting info from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruella_de_Vil?wprov=sfla1):

> Cruella's name is a pun of the words cruel and devil, an allusion which is emphasized by having her English country house nicknamed ""Hell Hall"". In some translations, for instance in Polish, Cruella De Vil is known as ""Cruella De Mon"", a play on ""demon"". In Italian, she is called ""Crudelia De Mon"" (a pun on ""crudele"", cruel, and ""demone"", demon). In the French translation of the Disney animated movie, she is referred as ""Cruella d'Enfer"" (Literally, Cruella of Hell or from Hell). In Dutch, the name remains ""De Vil"", while by coincidence the Dutch verb for skinning is ""Villen"" and ""Vil"" is the conjugation of this verb for the first person singular. In Portuguese, Cruella is known as ""Cruela Cruel"", which straightforwardly stems from ""cruel"".

> The name ""de Vil"" is also a literary allusion to Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). In the novel, the realty firm Mitchell, Sons & Candy write a letter, dated 1 October, to Lord Godalming, informing him that the purchaser of a house in Piccadilly, London is ""a foreign nobleman, Count De Ville"". Count De Ville, however, proves to be an alias for Count Dracula himself.

> It is also believed that the inspiration for the name began in 1939 when Dodie Smith purchased a new Rolls-Royce 25/30 ""Sedanca de Ville"" motorcar in which she and her pet Dalmatian ""Pongo"" frequently travelled, which also formed the basis of the cartoon imagery of Cruella's own motorcar."

"One time I was at a restaurant with a friend, sharing salsa and chips. I commented that the salsa had a very strong cilantro flavour, and she commented she couldn't taste anything other than coriander. We debated the issue for a few minutes, in disbelief that the other person was tasting something completely ""different"" and couldn't pick up on the taste the other thought was prominent. When I saw coriander seeds at the store a few weeks later I bought them to see what taste she had been talking about....and then the truth clicked."
"My family had something in a similar vein:

My parents had 3 kids and we fought a lot, especially during car trips. Whenever we would all be in the car for more than like 10 minutes, my mom and dad would put a dollar bill on the dashboard and say ""Quiet Game!"". Whoever was the last person to speak got the dollar.

"Ziplock bag, isopropyl alcohol, and salt. Fill bag with salt and iso, drop in your pipe, zip it up and give it a good shake. It helps to hold onto the pipe and the top of the bag at the same time so you essentially swish the mixture back and forth.

Do you post these anywhere? Would love to see more
This is gorgeous! You should be so proud!

Oh what a nice picture and what's the title? Wait this isn't a picture? Holy shit
I can taste all of them. Awesome
"These are blow pops, right? Tell me, did you eat them afterwards? It's suddenly very important that I know this."
"Nice work. I'd recommend taking a dry washcloth and lightly buffing the surface, being careful to change the part of the cloth you're using between colors, to remove the slight wax bloom that I'm noticing. After that you can add a layer or two of a sealant to stop it from coming back."
Damn I thought that was a photo
"Wow, I can almost smell this image."
I thought this was an actual picture from the 90s for a couple seconds. Well done!

Didn’t notice it was a drawing till I read the title
"This sucks!!!

- as a title"
...I’m just surprised you didn’t litter the edges of the photo with all the colors you used.
So awesome and fun to look at
"As a title idk why but for me ""childhood memories "" fits in my mind."
How can this look so damn realistic. Looks more like a photo than Art. Amazing.
Nailed it!! Nice job. The texture on the pops are so believable. What a fun subject to draw.
"I have a title for you, how about ""the eilish collection""?"
"Should use a thicker paper or be more careful, the damaged corners kinda damper this beautiful drawing"
You don't have your pencils lined up around the picture. 2/10
I wish I could draw like this
"Looks lifelike, almost like a claymation still, nice work!"
These look deliciously real. Nice work!
Its nice but all your dimensions seem off. Everything seems bendy and inconsistent including the sticks and shadows.

"Never forget Garry Hoy (RIP).    

*Garry Hoy was a respected corporate and securities law specialist in Toronto. He had also completed an engineering degree before studying law.*

*While giving a tour of the Toronto-Dominion Centre to a group of articling students, Hoy attempted to demonstrate the strength of the structure's window glass by slamming himself into a window. He had apparently performed this stunt many times in the past, having previously bounced harmlessly off the glass. However, in this instance the force of Hoy slamming into the window forced the window from its frame, causing the entire intact window and Hoy to fall from the building. The event occurred in a small conference room adjacent to a boardroom where a reception was being held for new articling students.*

*Structural engineer Bob Greer was quoted by the Toronto Star as saying ""I don’t know of any building code in the world that would allow a 160-pound (72.5 kg) man to run up against a glass and withstand it.""[3] In another interview, the firm's spokesman mentioned that the glass, in fact, did not break, but popped out of its frame, leading to Hoy's fatal plunge.*

The glass didn’t break when they found it, unfortunately the salesman broke all over the pavement... but he made the sale."

"Remember that one story of the guy who was like ""these windows are unbreakable"" and then proceeded to jump against the window? The window frame broke and he fell to his death.

Even if you have confidence in your product, you shouldn't have so much confidence in all the other pieces it's attached to."
Solid nope here.

Pretty sure in the UK window are meant to be in toughened frames above a certain height.

Snap back to reality
so you believe in gravity?
Gravity. Not just a good idea. It's the law.
"Yes, in Toronto. As you note, the window actually didn’t break as the guy who fell out said it wouldn’t. It had just weakened over time from him jumping against it, to where it finally just popped out whole - him along with it."
Similar to a Darwin Award story about a man who drank an elixir that was to protect against bullets.  He tested it by being shot in the chest rather than an arm or somewhere else less likely to be lethal.  You can probably guess the rest of the story.

"Yeah I agree. 70kg isn't much, and whole-wall glass windows aren't that rare, neither is a drunk man stumbling around. You'd think the amount of possibilities where someone might full force a window like that is pretty high, and that protecting against it would be a standard."

Do cultural appropriation accuses even make sense? Claiming that everyone should stick with their own culture sounds like the most racist thing a politically correct person could say.

True ignorance right there. Most major European countries rely on the Middle East for _~~almost all of their oil~~ a huge amount of their oil. The US produces 90% of our own. Tell me who has benefitted most from the war on terror

The entire global economy relies on the security provided by the US military combined with the capital and economic structure provided by the US Treasury,  US Central Bank, and US Financial institutions.

Its painfully clear you know very little about how the world *actually* works."
Don't expect Americans to have a clue on that. Too much jingoistic propaganda on daily basis.
"No it's not, we mostly use deciliters."
ok only 350 million more to go guys
"They already do. Thinking that the US government isn't teaching kids the metric system is like thinking trees grow tall because they think the ground smells bad. When I was in high school, all scientific denotation had to be metric. When I did trade work, the majority of our relatively small measurements were metric. The kids I work with now all know how to measure in metric. Fuck, most old people I know can do metric, they just don't because they aren't measuring shit."
But why?
"They already do? Students in America are already taught the metric system as well as imperial. If they end with with a job that requires metric, great, if not, also great. Just because Americans don’t use the metric system for everything doesn’t mean we don’t know it."

Your comment diminishes the issue, as if our focus shouldn’t really be on school shootings because people die more from other things. Really? Fucking really? God, are you completely lacking in empathy? Jesus Christ. Diminishing the issue like that practically implies that you’re okay with kids being fucking slaughtered in schools. I’ve heard of people arguing over the solution, but saying that it isn’t that big of a deal? What the fuck is wrong with you?"

"To say ""for no reason"" is wildly ignorant of our political history and culture, to say nothing of the practicalities that:
- guns don't need to wait for a police car to show up, which is often times 30 minutes away (the US is bigger than Europeans tend to think)
- guns protect minorities if police aren't
- guns protect women if they're smaller/weaker
- guns protect livestock when you can't stab a wolf
- guns do environmental regulation via hunting

All of which is secondary to the fact that guns are there to keep the government in check. We have the longest running constitution in history for a reason: checks and balances. That's just one big check."

"**Gay-friendly**

Gay-friendly or LGBT-friendly are the places, policies, people, or institutions that are open and welcoming to gay people (to include all members of the LGBTQ community) to create an environment that is supportive of gay people and their relationships, respectful of all people, treat all people equally, and are non-judgmental. This is typically a late 20th-century North American term that is the byproduct of both a gradual implementation of gay rights and acceptance of policies supportive of LGBTQ people in the workplace and in schools, as well as the recognition of gays and lesbians as a distinct consumer group for businesses etc.

The only reason Canadians still put up with imperial is because there are 350 million neighbours screaming it all the time. Hasn’t been taught in schools in decades
America tried to make the switch in the 1900's sometime but stopped when they realized the logistical nightmare that it was going to be to convert all the existing infrastructure. It was something like upwards of a couple billion USD and like a decade of work to manufacture and replace all the speed limit signs or some shit
"The 1-100 of f overlaps with daily life more than the 1-100 of c, so there’s more variation. Betters probably not the right word, but more comfortable might be."
Yes.
Are you saying it’s stupid to want more degrees of precision for temperature?
"Yeah b/c healthcare resources are fucking endless, right?"
Well no they'll just die
"It’s not just about the fact that it’s deaths. It’s not just about saving the most lives. It’s specifically about saving the lives of kids and making them feel safe. Accidental deaths like choking and car accidents happen everywhere. Sure, it’s good to invest in things that will save people from those, but they’re still accidental. Someone walking into a school with a gun and killing every kid in sight isn’t even close to the same, and I’m shocked that you’d even try to equate them.

The reason people are focused on school shootings is because they’re preventable deaths that are caused by our failures as a nation. Now, what those failures are may differ from person to person and I’m not here to argue that. The fact of the matter is, we aren’t doing a good job, and kids are dying because of it, or at the very least feel unsafe at the place they go to nearly every day.

You’re honestly a cynical asshole if you think people are pushing an agenda rather than just trying to fucking save lives, which is what it seems you’re implying."

What the fuck is wrong with the US"
"> guns are there to keep the government in check.



In case the government gets out of check, what exactly do you think your AR's and shotguns are gonna do against the US military?"
"But Americans already have /r/politics for their domestic politics, why can't we just have a sub for the rest?"
"American centric is in reference to it having an American centric perspective on matters. That is because of the other three points, collectively, but it’s chicken and the egg (e.g., is it American centric because of the other three points or the other way around?) That probably sums up the other three points as an umbrella point. I could make the argument that you could have a company that was created in country A, is based in country A, but primarily caters to country B (thus being B-centric). Look at countries who heavily target Chinese business markets despite not being Chinese countries. Or countries targeting their content/products at American consumers despite not being American companies. It does happen with some frequency. But that, as a separate point does tie into who is the primary user-base, so I’ll concede that as Roman numeral I and the other points are a through c (even though I don’t have a Roman numeral II).

Based in America and made in America are two different things. Take Budweiser for example. Created very much in America. Currently based in Belgium because it is now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev. 

Reddit is (a) based in America, currently.

Additionally, Reddit (b) was created in America. So A and B can stand as separate points when compared to other websites, companies, etc.

Despite these two points, it could be used primarily, when compared to any other one country, by a country other than the US. See Budweiser. See points concerning smaller countries primarily exporting to the US or China. Nevertheless, it is (c) used primarily by Americans. A through C combine to result in an American-centric website. Which it is. And which makes sense, logically.

While the volume of frivolous points doesn’t affect validity, I stand by my points as I’ve laid them out. Also, attacking what you perceive to be technical or procedural flaws in the argument rather than addressing the subject matter of the argument made does nothing to advance your point, if you have one (I know you aren’t the original poster), or the original poster’s point. It just sidesteps the issue with irrelevant subject matter.

At the end of the day, this is my point: Reddit, for various reasons including those I’ve laid out, is an American-Centric company/website/product/whatever you want to call it. Being shocked that content created therein is American-centric is stupid. Being aggressively insulting to another nationality by making sweeping generalizations because you’re angry by something that has a logical explanation is kind of stereotypical to the Americans that the original commenter seems to hate. Making the original commenter ironically, stereotypically American with their xenophobia."
"I’m 26, tool bag. But have fun knowing that you have the personality of exactly the thing you hate... hey, that’s also, ironically, boomer-like of you.

So to recap, you

(1) passionately hate foreign things based on stereotypes of that foreign country while having no interest in logical responses to your frustration; and

(2) respond to having your ironic flaws pointed out to you by giving pithy, condescending answers rather than counter-points. Which, in and of itself, showcases additional, ironic flaws (see “boomer”)...

Nope. The USA is the 3rd largest country on Earth so invasion is impossible. Don’t forget we would rape any military that even looks at us the wrong way. Go back to the USSR and see if starving to death changes your mind.
"I like the 0°C = Ice, 100°C = Boiling water"
Not the guy your responding to but decimal numbers exist.
To Americans all resources are incredibly scarce and limited until it comes to the military where scarcity and 'who's gonna pay for it' is never considered.
"You ***literally** just admitted* that saving lives is secondary to feeling safe lol

If it's feeling safe you're after, why not petition the media to just downplay school shootings instead of nation-wide coverage? I'd make our availability heuristics calm down, not interfere with the *rights* of the nation, and probably stop a few copycats to boot.

No matter how you slice it, going after the guns themselves is *agenda*, because it's the least effective solution out there."

"So when u gonna start killing cops? 

When they start murdering citiz- oh that's right, they already murder 1,000 citizens every year.

How about when they start rapi- oh yeah, 45 people are raped by onduty police every year.

When they start shooting everyone's do- oh wait, they murder 30 pet dogs every single day.

How about when the government invades your privacy with near constant monitoring just incase you're a terrorist? 

What about when they put people in cages for smoking a plant?

When the CIA violates human rights? When the FBI violates human rights?"

"There are two ""ar-15""s actually. The Armalite AR-15 and the colt AR-15 which is a trademark for the semi version. The M-16 is an Armalite AR-15 ie the select fire, while the colt AR-15 is based on the prior without the select fire.

The military don't use the colt version but they do use the version its based on. Still dumb argument either way."

"Yeah you might want to reread what I said, because I in fact did not say that feeling safe was secondary to saving lives. I mentioned that it was a part of it, but I never said it was the most important thing. And while we’re on the topic of you putting words into my mouth, I also never said that going after guns is the solution. Sounds like you’re pushing an agenda now.

And your “solution” is probably one of the stupidest fucking things I’ve ever heard. Maybe, just maybe, the way to make people feel more safe is to put an end to the fucking reason they feel unsafe in the first place."
"Pull of a trigger you know what i mean.

Point being, ""because i want to"" should not be a viable reason to own a lethal weapon that can only be used as a weapon and can kill so easily."
"are you seriously comparing the arsenal of the Vietnam war with what the military has today?

Do you expect every single American to rise up with arms in their hands? Not only would about half the country probably side with whatever the government is doing just because the other side isn't, military families would probably more likely to not go against the military.

And who said anything about the military taking over? It was about what if your people took their weapons and tried to go against the government.

Do you seriously believe that if, let's say every American who owns at least one gun got together with their arms to topple the government that they'd succeed?"
"But... you literally stated America was a shithole... in other words “AmERicA BaD...” I honestly don’t even know what the fuck you’re talking about at this point. Later, dude."
No I asked for an example of someone calling white people bigoted for cultural appropriation who also criticized them for not participating in the different culture’s holidays. Learn to read.

"Nah, the commute isn't bad. Not too far from work, and only 15 minutes away from all the shopping centers/restaurants even in heavy traffic. I spent a lot of time commuting to and from Chicago, so I'm no stranger to rotting in jammed up traffic. Never seems to get too bad out here though.

"The reason nobody says 20.75 is because there is no need for this amount of precision. If there was a need it would be trivial to add “halfs” or “quarters”.

That argument always confuses me. It’s not like people in the US can’t talk about things smaller than an inch in everyday life, is it? Though come to think of it maybe that’s the reason why everything is larger there."

If it was *just* about lives, we'd be learning the Heimlich right now. But, alas, that tiny second clause changes everything. Fear is a *huge* part of your argument. Don't try to downplay it. You're willing to risk the opportunity cost of hundreds of people chocking because you blew the money chasing the gunned boogie man.

&#x200B;

And I offered a solution to the fear: Stop the source. We fear plane crashes because we hear about them more than successful flights. We think we'll win the lottery because we hear about the winners more than losers. We think we'll die in a school shooting because we ignore the millions of safe students. This is known as the availability heuristic, and is well documented.  ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability\_heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) <= link, since you're apparently not one to look things up. I mentioned this last time.)

  
If you want to save lives, invest in Heimlich classes.

If you want to stop fear, stop sensationalizing.

&#x200B;

And if you don't want to take guns, what do you want to do? As far as I see, those are the only two solutions to your two issues. (inb4 you come back with ""I don't want to take guns, only *these arbitrarily chosen ones)*"
"Imagine what it would take to drive a single convoy from one end of Texas to another.

You don't know a damn thing about contemporary or historical geopolitics,  you're just talking out of your asshole, wasting the limited time remaining in your below average life."

"I mean president pepe is doing his absolute best to be a actual tyrant running a tyranny. Could you go handle that, then? You and your buddies? Pls&ty"
"That's literally the only difference. They're not just similar designs, the AR-15 is just an m16 without the trigger group that allows for automatic fire."
I think you misunderstood what I said. What's inherently more difficult about remembering 32 vs 0? The numbers.
"Yes, ever since I was left alone at the minus store as a child I get high blood pressure around n-gative numbers."
"**Availability heuristic**

The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.The availability of consequences associated with an action is positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something the greater those consequences are often perceived to be.

"The uprising population needs the same things to advance and I think the military is way better prepared. Especially food and base camps.

Not to mention electricity and other utilities the government could seize to make effectively banding together even harder.

But I don't think it would even come so far, even if a coup of that size wasn't detected early by NSA surveillance (nice Job keeping them in check btw) and averted by a bunch of SWAT teams they have drones and other aircraft.

Now there's two scenarios, either these 25%  of armed citizens move together as an army (which is easily bombed out of existence) or they're split up in small groups, which are then vulnerable to big team raids.

You keep mentioning Vietnam as if these scenarios are comparable in any way. They are not."
"Flying vehicles, explosives. If we can bomb people overseas and blame it on terrorism, we can do the same thing in the states because 100%, revolutionaries would be considered terrorists. Revolting against the government is suicide. The other thing folks don't think about is that the US government has allies, and they would also intervene, so even if a revolt would happen and it was too much for the US government to handle, allied forces would totally come in and keep the peace."

"Agree completely. He’s now posted on twitter disclosing that the LV logos are edited on, but only after being called out all over Instagram for it."
"Who follows these people? I don’t get it. 

When Instagram first came out it was a cool app for people to post artsy pics of nature and cities and stuff and now it’s this fucking awful shithole of wanna be D list celebrities."
the guy literally built his career off a lie this is  unsurprising. and unfortunately really common
Makeup is an art/talent/skill its really frustrating that people go on and edit their entire makeup look
Never understood why people would put logos on themselves. Are you the product ?
James Charles built his career off of a lie and now he's building ontop of it with more lies
I dont understand why he feels the need to even do this. You dont have to like or respect the guy to admit that hes actually damn talented when it comes to make up. He would do just fine without the extra bullshit.
"Imagine being proud of having branding on your face.

Hysterical."
the greats also have sycophants (is there a better word?) that will believe them no matter what they do. Being some shmo doesn't get  you anywhere near that kind of loyalty.
"Honestly, hers looked better then this."
James is open about using photo shop tho
If people still haven't figured out that Instagram is full of fakes then idk what to do with them
I don’t think that’s a girl
"In all honestly there is a chance he couldve used a stencil, but then again its too clean so almost definitely photoshop

Edit: just saw that he admitted it was photoshop, so ignore my comment"
At least he openly admits it and says he enjoys doing it.
Are people reaching max retardation?
"Yea how did they think anyone would buy this lmao, it doesn't follow the curve of their face and looks way way too clean and detailed"
Now that’s not the only difference.
"True but I also think you get out of instagram what you put into it. Literally. All I ever like are pictures of dogs, books and natural landscapes and so the app mostly shows me that. Then I went through a phase of liking drag pics and so for a few days that's the majority of what it showed me.

Honestly I've never viewed a single picture of the above person or any other wannabe and Instagram never shows them to me. That's actually why I prefer Instagram to other platforms because it does seem to learn what you like and tailor your feed to that. On FB, as an alternative example, you will see whatever the fuck people post whether you want to see it or not."
I love makeup and following people that are talented at it... you couldn’t pay me to follow trash like this though.
"Also 90% of interesting stuff on Instagram appears on reddit like 2 weeks prior, the only reason I use Instagram is to see what old and current friends are up to"
"I’m still not sure how to even find these gems. I have made zero effort to do so, but it’s possible that I’d delete everyone else just to give my full devotion."
"It's just picture-based social media, it can be anything you want. No one's making you follow makeup artists. My feed is my friends, nature photography, 90s benzes, and some memes."
"There are people who enjoy makeup. What do you not understand? I bet you'd understand if I just linked /r/MakeupAddiction. Typical reddit ""instagram bad"" circlejerk"
"Me, I like him. And I don't see photoshopping makeup as a problem because literally every celebrity does that. He's talented and you can see it on his YouTube channel."
James is an entertaining guy. That's more than enough reason to follow him.
What was that lie? I only found out who James Charles was well after he had blown up.
"Absolutely. This crazy, overly smoothed look is not attainable IRL even by the best artists. Make up is interesting and beautiful enough- people making tutorials, etc. like James should at least make the results somewhat attainable."
Because he’s soooo rich
I’ve never understood this cult obsession people have with designer fashion brands. Especially Louis Vuitton and Gucci
Some LV logos for extra tacky. I don’t understand why people pay for their shit.
"But this is the problem with him (one of them, at least). He’s constantly over editing and lying about things being photoshopped until it’s proven otherwise. 

You shouldn’t be posting tutorials and looks that are unattainable if your main ways of making money are tutorials/make up artistry and product collaborations."
It looks so flat. A stencil would follow the curve of brows etc
"Nah, the comments on his post are all positive/people saying “WOW such amazing detail!” Clearly anyone calling him out was deleted, and he says nothing in the caption about it being a fake look done in photoshop"
"He only admitted it was edited after he was called out multiple times, and he only admitted it on Twitter - the Instagram photo still misleads people into thinking he did it all with makeup (I personally don’t see how people are believing it, but they are!)"
Im a guy and know nothing about makeup but could he not make a stencil and airbrush it on as a layer? Would come out clean if done right.
Doesn’t it just show you what people you follow post?
"> still can’t avoid seeing him everywhere tho

You can if you really want - it's not that hard and the less we'll be promoting such people (even by ridiculing them), the better for all of us and especially for those who gets manipulated easily."
"It depends on what it is. For motorcycle stuff and surfing which is 50% of my feed it is original stuff that I don’t see on reddit. The other 50% is photoshopped ass, which I can see anywhere really."
"I actually use it as a way to find and follow artists (not MUA but actual artists). A lot of times they show sneak photos of what they are working on or updates on when prints will be available. I want my feed to inspire me and bring joy. The only “influencers” that I follow are ones that break the norms, like old ladies who wear what they want and act like they are the hottest thing on earth— which is so badass. 
It can still be a place for creativity, you just have to be searching the right hashtags."
"I like makeup and like seeing some of the looks, I am less interested in someone who tries so hard to sell themselves, instead of what they do with their skill."
He really isn’t
"Nope. He is D-, E+ maybe."
"Claiming this is a “look” though is absolutely deceptive. He’s a make up artist- meaning most people expect his looks to at least be real make up. Edits such as lighting and smoothing are normal (although extreme smoothing shouldn’t be IMO, because it’s unattainable IRL). However, he photoshopped the focal part of this look. Without it, it’s very basic and he ONLY said it was edited after people proved it was fake.

Edit: on Instagram he’s still not clearing it up. It’s only on Twitter he admits it’s photoshop."
Nah.
I tried watching him since he's always on trending but I can't stand how he repeats himself so much.
"I’m pretty sure he claimed that the photographer for his high school yearbook let him edit his picture and used it in the yearbook. When actually, he just took the photos, edited them, and posted them online claiming they were in the yearbook. He blew up on social media after posting that; it basically started his career."
He blew up after posting on twitter about being extra and bringing a ring light to his school photo. It was proved that it was a lie through old friends text messages iirc
My guess? His face
I thought you weren’t allowed to mention the subject of the picture?
I remember when cancel culture was just called consequences
"Lol that response to ""cancel culture"" is an ""influencer's"" desire to silence ordinary people getting a platform that they never had before when it's starting to hurt their bottom line. 

If you think people haven't always been harsh on celebrities or public figures at mere ""allegations"", you're delusional. Heard of Monica Lewinsky?

It's one of the best things of this age. People sending and receiving information across the globe in seconds. It's a miracle."
"I'll be frank, I stopped following because I'm not into unecessary Youtube drama. 

He still doesn't seem like a very good person to me (well most influencers aren't) but I see what you mean about cancel culture being toxic."
Oooh so edgy
"If he used a stencil, he would have still had to put it against his eye which isn't flat, so it wouldn't appear flat like this"
It would come out “clean” but it’d still follow the dimensions and curves of his face
Entertainment can't be subjective?
My goodness people get famous for the silliest things. Meanwhile here I am working hard for things in life :c
"Oh wow. That’s fucking ridiculous in 2 ways. 
Firstly how the fuck do you blow up for being a dickhead and making a scene? 
Secondly what in the fuck type of person lies that they where a spoilt brat? 
Thanks for the info tho mate."
"Im struggling to work out how to respond to this because you really didnt make any point. You're saying about influencers silencing ordinary people but I'm just an ordinary person who realises that the false allegations and gossip that comes with being a social media star is actually more tollerable than the people who are then obstinate about things they know nothing about. Actively trying to destroy a person's career for something a normal person would receive absolutely no backlash for is ridiculous.

Of course people have always gossiped but you said it yourself, people sending and receiving information across the globe in seconds. Information whether true or false spreads faster now than ever before and billions of people have a voice, in comparison to the mere thousands, maybe tens of thousands that would work for newspapers or magazines etc

If you think that watching people have their entire life dismantled for the most insignificant of indiscretions and pushing them to the edge of suicide is one of the best parts of the Internet age then I think you should probably work on that with a psychiatrist"
"Wait, it's a friggin guy in OP's picture??"
Oops nvm
Yeh which is fine if he did it that way i guess
Nah.  Like what I like or GTFO.
"True, but you've also never considered editing LV logos onto your own face for validation (I assume). I think you're actually a lot better off than you're taking credit for."
Gahh I feel ya.

It seems very convenient to make millions from it, and complain about ""cancel culture"" when social media starts hurting their bottom line. 

Your criticisms aren't about social media, it's about celeb worship culture. 

It's a good thing for people to vote with their wallets or views and that the youth are not willing to put up with despicable behaviors that earlier generations have excused and that they can ""cancel"" someone who they previously couldn't. The 80s was an entire musical era about date rape, and now kids won't tolerate racism and attempts at ""turning straight people?"" fuck yeah. My generation didn't even tolerate gay people. You kids rock. 

Some people certainly deserve it.

Ahem kat von disease.

And JC and tati and J* will all bounce back. People have the attention span of a goldfish."
why is that hard to believe you old coot
Agreed.
Preach.
"I'm not just talking about James Charles nor just about the beauty community, there are many examples from across social media. While there are some people who deserve their downfall, cancel culture is not just about taking down someone who has done something wrong. Many people who get ""cancelled"" didn't do what they were accused of but once the ball starts rolling its hard to stop it. This is a perfect example of that, he already proved his innocence with regards to ""forcing himself on straight men"" but people have chosen not to hear his side of the argument for whatever reason and then continue to spread false, in some cases defamatory, information. That is most of what cancel culture is, not the actual good work of exposing morally corrupt social media stars

Edit: you edited while I was replying and I cba rewriting my paragraph"
Something something boomer
Because it's more effeminate than 3 dudes banging 4 dudes.
"I suppose what I'm trying to say is that's been a political tactic for all of human civilization.
(the recent birther conspiracy, etc).

Tati probably tried to discredit JC while advertising her vitascam. I bet this entire scandal gained her millions. 

Anyway, you seem like a really sympathetic person, but I assure you, they're probably crying into their millions. Part of the script of a BG is that they want to come off as people ""just like us"". But I'm sure JC, tati and J* are all fine. 

If anything, ""cancel culture"" has given me hope. A lot of young people aren't willing to tolerate anti-science, racism, unsanitary makeup, deceptive marketing, homophobia, etc, and there was little we could do about that prior to social media. 

When few controlled the platform, it was easy to control toxic narratives. With social, your average person can make real positive changes. Sure, maybe we should do our due diligence in waiting for receipts, but I'd like to point out that's not an expectation we had of anyone prior to social media either."
that doesn't even make sense
Comment
The move makes more sense when you know that AEG the conglomerate who own LA Galaxy also own 45% of Hammarby IF.
"Omg haha, malmö must be furious"
"This literally doesn't seem real, I would imagine his wage demands are greater than the rest of our squad combined. I won't believe this is anything but a publicity stunt before I watch him win us the league with my own eyes."
"Thats a very missleading title. Nothing confirmed, probably just Zlatan trolling"
Boosting that career goals stat.
"This has to be a joke, probably a publicity stunt"
*Malmö disliked that*
"Most popular theories so far in sweden:

1. He has joined as minority owner.


2.. he is moving to Stockholm, and his son(s) will play for their youth teams.


3. His brother will do eSports for them.


4. Some kind of business of his will have something to do with hammarby."
"This is not real. Hammarby have not published anything on their website, which they always do on a transfer."
"Nope, it's a PR move revolving Jobman.
Or some other company Zlatan represents."
"Saw it on Twitter and it makes sense, it could be that Hammarby has signed Zlatan’s younger brother KekGs to their ESports team"
From one AEG owned team to another
This came out of nowhere. Expected him to go to one of the top 5 European league clubs. Seems like he's ready for retirement.
"Lot of living legends return to their home country for a season or two before calling it a career.

eg Maradona, Ronaldinho, etc :)"
Possibly the most mercenary move he has done in his career so far. Why join Hammarby and not Malmö FF?
"Oh God no this can’t be true, I support AIK in Sweden this cannot happen please 

It’s have to be some sort of commercial because how can Hammarby afford his wages? Why would he go back to Sweden now and if he did surely it would be back to Malmö

I refuse to believe he’s sgned for them as a player"
"it looks like he finally wants to settle down to his country, but not malmo ? malmo will be very disappointed by this decision, i think. good luck for him then. he is one of biggest football icon in the  past 20 years."
"Next post: ""Order your own official jersey from any team with your own name on it on www.website.com"""
Vad i helvete?
Zlatan and the art of the >!anti!<climax.
Has to be a PR stunt?!
"No, he doesnt."
Did not see this coming at allllll. Good for him though.
Shambles
Lmao what
Guess he's ready to call it a career
Good morning Zlatan
Waiting for the debut overhead kick.
"Well, I guess AC Milan are stick with Piatek lmao."
This has to be a stunt
"Hahahaha good one lads, now who’s he really signing for?"
"Ibrahimovic is a prick, wouldn't put it past him."
Could it be a son?
Maybe just wanted to play/live in Stockholm?
That was certainly anticlimactic
That’s cool!
Wow
Wut
It's not happening. He wouldn't do that to Malmö.
"Well that came out of left field, hes going to destroy that league"
It has to do with e-sport. A non story.
Thought that gorilla was dead?
Ingen chans. Hur fasen har Hammarby råd med Zlatan??
Finish the god damn sentence.
"Me, a delusional Milan fan, still hoping he's just messing around. Can't see why he wouldn't finish his career at Malmo tho"
If what?
Good luck to Zlatan!!!
Yeah this is the last thing I expected this morning
I dont believe that. Most swedes dont from what I have seen. Most likely a publicity stunt for some company he is involved in
"Smart title OP, maybe he is buying a part of the club"
Wow
Probably just his kids.
"I expected Malmo, this is surprising."
"The way he is vague about it, and doesnt mention his first name, I suspect this has something to do with his brother and esports."
It's Hammar time.
This is taking a piss
No way come on
How are they going to pay him?
Imagine if it was all a joke and he comes back to Malmo
More chances for Zlatan to purchase Hammarby itself than him joining as a player.
Joins who
Nothing is official yet for all we know it could be a brand deal for zlatan
I was really holding out for some craziness at Tottenham even if it wasn't highly likely.
"Zlatan is involved in a betting company by the name of “BetHard”. I can say, with a lot of confidence, that his Instagram post is concerning “BetHard” becoming a sponsor for Hammarby IF."
Thought there might be a chance he would go to spurs haha
Clearly untrue.   No sane player would want to compete for minutes with the skeletal remains of Aron Jóhannsson
"Haha no way he joins hammarby, probably one of his sons."
Joins what?
According to [Calciomercato.com](https://www.calciomercato.com/news/ibrahimovic-scherza-sui-social-e-si-annuncia-all-hammarby-56515) this is a joke. Probably sign of a commercial collaboration.
Thought he would join Malmo
"I find it hard to believe that it's not a publicity stunt, when has a player ever announced a transfer before the club? But maybe I'm just in denial."
Kräktes lite i munnen
My FM20 is ready
This is a publicity stunt for Bethard probably
You married Zlatan?
Nej för fan! Han ska ju gå med Djugårn inte Bajen!
Dicks out for Hammarby
To be clear: It’s not confirmed by Hammarby IF yet and Ibra loves cryptic messages.
"Actually, Hammarby IF joins Zlatan Ibrahimovic"
Could be his brother joining their Esports team? or himself investing in it?
"Nope, not just joins, HE BUYS THE CLUB."
IF what? IF they erect a statue in his honor? IF they start a religion named Zlatanism? IF they print his face on their jerseys?
He's likely just trolling. It's because LA Galaxy and Hammarby share some owners and some reps from Hammarby are visiting LA right now.
"I think this has to be something with his betting company.

Why even join Hammarby now? It's just nowayjose"
"Whilst I doubt this is actually real, would certainly make them a fun team in FM20."
"I recently realized I was allergic to carrots. I just thought they made everyone's mouth numb, you know, just like almonds.... I also learned recently that I have an almond allergy."
Dicks out for Hammarby
Zlatan buys Hammarby.
Does Zlatan have a child who'd sign for them?
Är det här verkliga livet eller är det bara fantasi?
Malmo wants VAR on this decision
Harambe FC?
"Well, at least he didn't sign for Flat Earth FC"
Madlad
He wanted to finish his career in the league that made him. Can't fault him
"One ic out, another ic in. The Hammarbic must be complete."
Should have gone to Celtic
Booo
intermittent fasting?
Thought Mourinho wanted him at Tottenham.
"This has to be a stunt right?

He could still easily make it into the starting 11 of any European club"
Spain in shambles
Great can I stop hearing about him now it's doing my head in
Wait didn't they die in a NY zoo?
Hahahaha what a cunt
CØMMÜNICADO ØFFICIAL
Hammarby joins Zlatan
I'd love this a lot more if he didn't act like such a big shot and talk so much shit while in LA.
Hammar what ? Doesn't make sense to me.
Cool-H dropping the business knowledge. That makes complete sense in that context.
Red Bull-tier trade.
Doubt he cares about that as he is a free agent.
Stonks
That makes a lot more sense.
"Mate, you can't support a conglomerate"
Well it's not true I am 100% sure
"He even got a statue outside the stadium in Malmö just a few months ago...

This ruined my day."
"Well, that was a surprise tbh. 

Just thought about the same.  What Malmö guys think about this?"
They are. Even though this is not true (it most likely is his brother joining some Hammarby e-sport team) it pains them just to see his name on another shirt
"Is Hammarby IF a rival to Malmo or something?  Obvoiusly, Malmo would prefer if he signed with them but I don't get why they would be furious otherwise."
As a non-Swede I feel so left out of the conversation this comment provoked.
My guess is that it is Zlatans brother Keki Ibrahimovic who will play FIFA for Hammarbys E-sports team.
Det här måste vara ett skämt och du kan inte ändra min åsikt
Like you’re saying. I think its more probable he’s becoming a part-owner rather than a player.
He would never.
"Pretending to join another club in this way would be the biggest troll Zlatan’s done by far. Seems unlikely he isn’t serious to me, but we’ll see."
"The sporting director and ceo of hammarby were in Los Angeles and said ""at this point we have nothing to comment"""
The Swedish league is probably around the same level as MLS i think
Tror inte på det tills klubben släpper något
Längst fram går....ibrahimovic
My Ikea desk has become sentient?
"The maddest lad, some say."
[deleted]
Garanterat.
Would make a lot more sense than Ibra playing for Hammarby.
But why would Jesper Jansson and the rest of the executive team then be in LA?
Who are you to doubt Hammarby?
Hammarby is playing Europa League next season mate and Zlatan wants that trophy.
">  Expected him to go to one of the top 5 European league clubs.

...and what makes you think he's at that level right now? What clubs in those leagues even would take a chance on a 39 year old semi-retired player?"
Nice misleading title though when nothing is confirmed. Gotta get that karma I guess.
Bruh when's Messi leaving?
"It's true but not to rival club. Ibra is Malmo's youth product and it's sure bitter when he choose to close his career at their direct rival

Imagine if Cristiano Ronaldo moves to Benfica or Porto at the end of his career"
But I thought ibra childood club is malmo
Preferably not to a rival.
I'm pretty sure he's not too fond of MFF since they fucked him over when he went to Ajax. At least i get that feeling
AEG that owns LA Galaxy also has a 45% stake in Hammarby. This would be the first time they ever express any interest in Hammarby beyond getting access to arena rights though.
"If bajen signs Zlatan, I'm so done with hif/dif. they cant both be good while AIK goes for a re-build"
"He has said that he cant live in Malmö, it's too small and he is too famous. He cant walk anywhere, and people sleep outside of his house etc. That's why he sold his house there"
Title of your sex tape
I thought he did that by going to the MLS
Why would he go back to professional football after two seasons away if he was retiring?
He called it a career when he went to the MLS bro
WTF this is the biggest climax ever yet I doubt it's true.
Didn’t Mou say like yesterday he wasn’t interested?
We have a 50+1 rule in Sweden and minority owner AEG wants access to the arenas so that isn't happening
Best team in the world mate.
I know this isn’t about the subject but how do u change ur flair?
"Tbf Zlatan did so when moving go United, but I still think this is some sort of a publicity stunt."
Cringe
Serie A made him imo but I get what you're saying
Cus the kits are similar?
"nah he is finished at champions league level, i mean do you really think he would start in bayern, barca, madrid, city, liverpool, psg etc??"
"As someone who mainly follows Allsvenskan, certainly not!"
"I'm not a fan of Hammarby, but this would be amazing"
Well.... He is a big shot
By
He can pull that shit in LA but not in Hammarby.
"What does cool-h mean, I can't be the only one wondering here"
But that explains how Hammarby is able to pay his contract
"He might not, but they'd definitely be keen on holding onto their biggest asset."
Oh god I’d be absolutely raging
This is why you never erect a statue of a living person.
">Hammarby IF

What's that?"
Yeah time to bring that down.
"Why did Malmö erect a statue of a guy who played for them for only 2 seasons? I get that he's probably the most notable player associated with the club, but this is like Everton building a Wayne Rooney statue."
... also wants one in Hammarby !
Why tf would you do that?
Why tf would you do that?
"Disbelief, the only reason I can see him going to Hammarby is that he (or his wife) really wants to move to Stockholm and Hammarby has found some way to pay his wages while no other Stockholm club has. Not impossible but I'll believe it when I see it."
"Hammarbys main rivals are the other Stockholm teams, but sure there’s rivalry between all of the bigger teams. I guess the main thing tho is that Zlatan has been such a big profile for malmö and skåne county overall that it would seem unthinkable that he’d go anywhere else"
Doesnt matter that they arent direct rivals. Zlatan is a malmö legend and weve been begging him to come back to malmö for like 5 years at least. Also there is a pretty strong regional rivalry/identity between Scania and Stockholm.

No, this must be a joke, Hammarby has not come out and said anything about this?

Hammarby has not said anything yet, though it is 8 in the morning so they may be sleeping in the office.

However, i would understand if he would like to move back to Sweden

Not that Zlatan is known for not having a hybris, maybe he got tired of Bajen's social media team?

In any case, I will refuse to believe this until further notice as a hammer changer, otherwise Sthlm derby

Leave it to the Liverpool fan to be homophobic
Also I'll be low key surprised if he's still there/playing next season. I know he's a monster but 39 is no joke when your name isn't Buffon
Didnt play the final because of a injury. Every time he left a club he missed winning CL. Uefa cup is the best next thing.
He doesn't have CL though. Win EL this season so he can get CL next season. Simple.

Always knew than legends finish in a club being anonymous in a really small club

>Imagine Man Utd legend Owen signing for Liverpool
"Our fault. He literally had a move to Liverpool in his contract with Newcastle, but we never used it. You guys had better players than us at the time yet he was good enough for you but not for us. I'm blaming that one on our management rather than Owen. Who are we to dictate where he can go when we don't allow him back?"
"More the latter, but it's really impossible to make a comparison. Hammarby is not a club with a winning tradition yet it's always had a massive following from the southern parts of Stockholm. This following has grown to new heights ever since moving to the new arena 2013, and since 2014 we've had the biggest average attendance in Scandinavia. It's only this season and the one before that we have been title contenders, in 2010 to 2014 we played in the second division

So if you have a team in the PL that draws the largest crowds by a massive margin, recently spent 5 years in the second division and has only won the league once than that would be us. 

Also, fun fact: we won the league in 2001 despite everyone thinking we would get relegated that year. We also fired the coach that won us our only league title (Sören Cratz) because we didn't play attacking football under him. Attacking football (or bajensamba as we call it) is such a big part of our identity and not even a title was worth compromiseing that."
"Hammarby and Malmö is like a ""they are good teams fighting for the top spots"" Neither is Liverpool or City class above the rest.

If we gotta draw some parallels, Malmö is City with the ammount of titles they have lately. Hammarby has 1 title ever and have never been this good as they are right now"
"Sant iofs. Men han var väl bara på stadion när de firade 20 mästerskap, mesta mästarna och allt det? Jävligt bull om han drar till Hammarby i vilket fall som helst."
I think he underestimates how famous he is in sweden lol. That was what he said
"I think he has a better chance of privacy in Stockholm at least. You can find the Skarsgård brothers on the Hammarby stands singing with the Ultras whenever they have time of, they are just like everyone else."
"I mean, he won his only major European trophy with us."

He improved just as much in Serie A
"Nah, that cant be it"
What is allowed? I mean if they are own by a company with shitloads of money. That company can pay him shitloads of money.
The US invasion of Iraq was not allowed but they let themselves in anyway.
"Anyone can donate as much money they want. What is not allowed is owning more than 49% of a club as 51% needs to be owned by the members of the club. Therefore it is not as attractive to invest in a swedish club as you are not in control of your investment. This is what we call the ""51% regeln"" or the ""51% rule"" - effectively leaving the clubs in the hands of it´s members/supporters."
"Maybe not but there's cool concepts and practices like becoming brand ambassadors for LAGalaxy or AEG, if that's too in your face become some sort of football adviser/ technical consultant to the group if that sounds too conflicty of interest just  hide the payment under some far hidden group company with separate ownership/board just like all other corporation in the world."
"While investing in the club and having to pay Zlatan’s wages through the club’s wage structure surely is an option, the mother company that owns Hammerby could just offer Zlatan a ‘personal sponsorship’ of sorts and pay him directly."
"Yeah, but in signing him for Hammarby they've definitely retained him in that sense"
14yo?

Relevant flair ^:(
Of course it's a genuine question lmao
"Actually, if we're picky, Hammarby IF is not a football club, that would be Hammarby IF fotbollförening.

Hammarby IF is an association involved in several sports.

""IF"" is an abbreviation for idrottsförening (meaning sports association). Which makes the full name of the football-part of the association ""Hammarby Sports Association Football Association"" (when translated to english).

But to be fair, the football part of the association is probably what it has been most known for during recent years. And the professional senior mens football team part of Hammarby IF will very unlikely be referred to with aforementioned specificity, but rather by the name and nicknames of the whole association like Hammarby IF, HIF, Hammarby or Bajen."
How do you mean bigger?
"Its really not, they have won 1 league title"
Hammer Village
"Thought that was west ham. Oh well, same difference."
"That was Harambe JF, where JF stands for Justice For."
Then they've just earned a new plastic fan.
Our newer mentality we are growing that we are good enough to win and the best at the same time is much more preferable though I think.
"No, less. But they're also historically less competitive than the other two major clubs (AIK won the league last year and Djurgården this year) which you would think matters to Zlatan. But the reaction will be the same no matter if he goes to Hammarby or IFK Göteborg."
"I’d guess so. Can you understand basic German? I think it might be that for us German is very easy to understand, Norwegian and danish just understandable, and Swedish is just beyond readible, whilst for you it’s the other way around. Danish and Norwegian easy, German graspable and dutch just beyond."
"To me, Swedish is like Norwegian but with more a's."
"Confirmed. Dutch is confusing af for me (a swede) I hear words that I should understand, in a cadence I'm familiar with, but it makes zero sense. It's the exact opposite with Danish (for me) I hear something that sounds like absolute garbage and makes on sense but just as the sentence concludes I realize I understood what the person said."
"I mean, same can be said for us tbh. 

I’ve heard someone describe dutch as an English person living in Germany for a long time getting drunk and mixing words and grammar up, which seems quite close."
Clearly.

"The only team that is referred to as ‘Manchester’ by 90% of the world outside England? Isn’t this something very common Holland? It certainly is amongst my Dutch friends. Or is this you trying to appeal and grab some karma off of the depressed, stereotypical English footy fan?"
There's not enough room for both him and John Lundstram in one club though.
"Must've hurt to lose to a small, anonymous club in Paris then?"
"Lol that's not even comparable.

More like Lampard joining Arsenal or Tottenham"
"More like Lampard joining Chelsea, he's a Hammer after all."
Maybe they looked at him as a bloke and didn't want such a huge mood-hoover like that in their dressing room?
I wouldn't say they're nearly as well known as Zlatan here though.
"Leaves Inter, Inter wins CL. Leaves Barca, Barca wins CL. Nothing happened in Milan and PSG after he left those clubs."
> major
Clearly Pavon's being trash gave him a spot on the World Cup roster for Argentina.
"Not just the wages, but that they're paid in full and on time. 

&#x200B;

Even some Russian and Turkish clubs have had problems in recent years sometimes. Alex Song at Kazan (?) I think had the big story about him."
"It's a Copa90 video. They do a bunch of stuff about teams all over the world. 

I'm guessing you are a salty gårdare?"
His season at PSG imo but I get what you are saying
"His season at MLS made him imo, you don't become a man until you go through 40k people chanting ""FIGHT AND WIN"" trying to fuck up your mind, but I get what you're saying."
"You can only use money the club has earned i think, not take from other companies directly"
"Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia, Jeremy. Welcome to the real world."
Which tank did Zlatan drive
That escalated quickly..
"Only statue we have is FA cup winning captain Fred Keenor. We may have killed him though, I'm not sure."
"It's easy to interpret it as not genuine, though, considering it's pretty obvious *what* Zlatan would be joining — a football club. What else would he be joining?"
How is such a thing considered genuine question in Google era?
And you aren't even op
Go home nerd! My sister was born in your town.
"You bloody weirdos, I mean why have a bunch of different sports being able to train etc in the same space and under the same name! Sacrilege I tell you!
If I want to play rugby, hockey, train, or run a race I have GOT to do it in a completely different environment. 

You mainland Europeans are all strange."
as in the opposite of smaller
"It's the biggest in Scandinavia terms of average attendance and among the biggest right now in terms of squad, economy, results etc. Obviously Malmö dominates all categories except attendance."
"What?  What do you think ""bigger"" means?"
"I'm not even Swedish, but have you ever seen a Hammarby match? Their fans are some of the very best in Scandinavia."
Biggest as in number of supporters.
"Still one of the biggest brands in Swedish football, they have fans all over Sweden and the biggest attendance over past years. They’re bigger than some of the clubs that have won more"
Just like liverpool soon will have won one premier league title? Must be shit tier club then.
"A by is a city in the superior Scandinavian language, Danish"
"maybe its a prank 
and he's going to malmo instead"
"Think if its true, his choice could be for the possibility of a nice ego boost, cause Hammarby was really close this year, and him joining them and winning next year, he will take 100% credit for getting them the win."
"No we don't understand german, maybe some words but won't understand most sentences without studying. But most of us have trouble understandning even danish so it's not really weird."
"Also consider that Swedish and German are the, relatively and geographically speaking, bigger languages. A bunch of Swedish radio and TV is probably still broadcasted in Norway and Denmark, and this might be the case of German/Dutch (although I’m not sure), at least historically.

With that said, I pretty much feel exactly like you stated, but I do have some Danish family which I believe helps. Danish and Dutch are also languages more closely related to English, so I wouldn’t be surprised if ones proficiency in English would help bridge that gap."
Don't really understand it but it's very easy to get the basics off with minimal effort
The first time I heard someone speak Dutch it reminded me of the gibberish language from The Sims.
"""nicht ein"" yup!"
Hammarby har sovmorgon det antagligen därför vi inte har någon info än
Skulle dock förstå om han skulle vilja flytta tillbaka till Sverige
"Inte som att Zlatan är känd för att inte ha hybris, han kanske blev trött på Bajens sociala media-team?

Jag kommer iallafall vägra tro på detta tills vidare som hammarbyare, annars kommer Sthlm-derbyna va svinroliga att kolla på"
ah i love the Owls up the Sheffield
not my point though is it
cant believe he won the Europa League with an entire city
Lundstrum to barca confirmed?
Everybody love a good underdog story buddy
Or Arsenal legend Petr Cech joining Chelsea
"My point is that celebrities ride the bus and take the metro all the time in Stockholm while being left alone. Zlatan might not be able to do that, who knows, but he already has multiple properties here and spends significant time in Stockholm already"
"Mate, Zlatan's only European trophy counts higher than anything Arsenal have won in Europe in their entire history."
"Turkish clubs have always been like this, also with transfer fees"
Then they can come up with incredibly favorable sponsorship from the company to the club. Same thing PSG did to get around FFP.
There are always ways around that.
"Swedish clubs are free to receive and spend money money from anywhere, but they can't sell more than 50%-1 of their shares"
Zlatan does not need a tank to invade a country
Tank was* zlatan
"Well, I see him joining a MMA team."
And here we have the death of conversation.
I will. Say hello to your sister for me!
In Scandinavia? In terms of results? FC Copenhagen is surely top there
"Surely you're aware of the 'bigness' of football clubs.

Like how in a few years time, when the rags are battling Leeds in the championship. They'll be safe in the knowledge that they're still bigger than us."
"I went to a rave in some woods in Sweden and ended up in the company of some Hammarby fans.

The lads looked after me all night, took me for breakfast beers and then to the match. It was absolutely immense. I'm now a Hammarby fan for life."
"Eh, they have a lot sure. But we are better ;) MY team is a Stockholm rival so I will never give them credit.

I have seen a few hammarby matches. The derbies vs them"
"They dont have fans all over sweden. They have a really passionate fan base in the south of Stockholm. Most non-stockholm fans who likes stockholm follows DIF for the most part. 

Hammarby is big sure but not bigger than the 2 other clubs in Stockholm"
"18 league titles for Liverpool since 1892 and 0 since the PL's start 92-93 sure.

Hammarby has 1 league title since their creation. 104 years ago. 1 title since 1897. wow."
The language no one understands when spoken?
"Well it is Zlatan so the prank part is pretty probable, but i still think he’s going to Milan or some similar club."
Can confirm that we watch quite a bit of Swedish TV shows in Norway.
"Guys, I literally didn't understand a thing but Scandinavian languages look really fun"
Både Hammarby's sportchef och Vd var i LA igår
Or Chelsea legend David Luiz joining Arsenal
> only
Exactly like what Man City did with Guardiola
"Didn't work though, they saw their sponsporship deals reevaluated to a more legit sum by UEFA. Had to comply and sold massively after spending those 400M momos on Neymar and Mbappe. 

It's literally written in the FFP rules my dude.

>UEFA accountants can review related company deals that might be from a sister company or parent company's subsidiary. Manchester City's deal with Abu Dhabi Investment Group and Paris Saint-Germain's deal with Qatari Investment Group fall under such reviews.

How is this sub consistently upvoting shite"
The chairman of Östersunds FK was just recently sentenced to three years in jail for putting money in the club
I see him being an MMA team
A bit melodramatic? Typing that question into Google and getting an instant response would seem a better way than asking on here
Shut it down boys
Will do.
"No, I never said that Hammarby was the biggest in term of results (although we did win UEFA Intertoto thank you very much). 

I said we are the biggest in terms of attendance in Scandinavia: FC Copenhagen has 12K on average and we have 24k."
"Among the biggest he said, not THE biggest"
"Nah, Leeds will get promoted."
So you were bribed. Good job by the lads.
Liverpool Stockholm?
"They do have fans all over Sweden, fans who travel to watch them as well from other cities. And never said they were bigger than the other stockholm clubs. And also you literally said “it’s really not” to my claim that they’re one of the bigger ones in Sweden, not the biggest"
"Just wanted to burn Liverpool for a bit hehe.
League titles isnt all that matters and even less so when you go back generations. Aston villa sure as shit aint no top 5 club and they are not bigger than city is by any metric other than titles."
Skåne tilhører Danmark bro
It was a pain during 2016 in Sweden when all Swedish girls spoke norweigan after Skam
"Där är en å, och i åa är en ö

That's an actual sentence"
Isf kmr matchen mot Malmö nästa år vara svinrolig att gå på.
He means the only Manchester club not actually in Manchester
He stole tax payer money man. That's a bit different. Anyone can sponsor a team with as much money as they wish.
"Well thats not really true. He was put in jail because he embezzled millions of Kroner which he then gave to the club. Anyone can give money to clubs, but no one can own more than 49% of a club as 51% is reserved for the members, the so called 51% rule."
I can see an MMA team joining *him*
"Advantage is that everyone who reads the thread can see the answer, so it saves time for everyone who reads the comment!"
"I don't think so. If I ask here, I may get a reply that gives me a good understanding what the significance of that team is, how surprising it is that Zlatan would choose them etc. On Google, I get the information that is a football club (which is obvious), from Sweden (which is kinda obvious), from Stockholm (which is sightly more interesting) and everything else I kinda have to find myself. Better to ask someone who may already have a good understanding of it."
"Someone asks it here, someone answers it, saves hundreds from googling it."
"I mean they took me to a lake with some really hot chicks and then we went skinny dipping.

The more I think about it the more I was bribed."
Their TIFO is probably the best in Sweden. Great atmosphere on matchday no matter the game. Id still consider them the smallest club out of the 3 Stockholm teams but they always show up on the stands while my AIK can be league leaders and still not get 50% attendance for a match vs a mid-level club
"Hammarby is 12th in Sweden in all-time points. Behind so called ""shit clubs"" currently battling in the 2nd division.

For reference Malmö is 1st and AIK 3rd, Djurgården 7th. Hammarby needs more than double their points (1627) all time to catch up to AIK at (3419)"
2019 — you can definitely have it back
"I read the other day that the mayor of Copenhagen wants make/rebrand Skåne part of ‘greater Copenhagen’ as the area could benefit from a boost via rebranding and the fact there are so many people who work here from Skåne. 

Just the first step in reclaiming rightful danish clay"
Därför Zlatan inte vill tillbaka till Malmö
"Skåne is literally a waste of money so be my guest, you can have it."
"In a Danish dialect, you could technically have the conversation ""Æ I u å æ ø i æ å? A æ å u å æ ø i æ å"""
No u
I assume 99.9% knows Zlatan will be joining a football club... Especially considering the context of Malmo in the same thread.
"Someone already mentioned Malmo, though. Even if you don't know Hammarby, the pieces are all there to put it together."
"> On Google, I get the information that is a football club (which is obvious), from Sweden (which is kinda obvious), from Stockholm (which is slightly more interesting) and everything else I kinda have to find myself.

I mean, if your question is simply ""What's that?"", I would expect that those are exactly the answers you're looking for."
"They still have huge support in sweden, not quite sure on numbers but im guessing not far behind Malmö, AIK, etc."
"Why the hate on Skåne? I think Malmö, Lund and Helsingborg are great cities"
The Scandinavian languages are a thing of beauty!

"Most people who say “OK boomer” are usually minimum wage children who contribute very little to society, though. And I say this as a millennial."
That happened
Still doesn’t make ok boomer ok to say. It’s just fucking idiotic at this point.
It's really no different than saying okay (insert race or gender) because some have a common ideology. It's no longer funny and is played out.

"So, you, a Republican, are saying that ""minimum wage children"" contribute ""very little to society"". Pretty much un-verifiable, but ok, cool. Is it because they are paid less, and so pay less taxes? If so, are you for raising the minimum wage? Because if not, your comment makes absolutely no sense at all."
"Someone who works minimum wage is working as many hours as anyone else, and most likely pumping all their money into the economy. How are they not productive?"
Ok boomer
"So women have a common ideology? No. It’s not even comparable to (insert race or gender). It’d be more comparable to something like ok liberal, ok republican, or ok racist."

"A lot of K9 units have remotes to release the dogs, for just this reason."
"I love how casually he steps back to open the door. 

“Why’d you have to go and do that”"
Dayum. That dog was about to rip that dude's arm off.
Fur missle deployed.
Looked like he had plenty of backup to me. The kind with big teeth too.
"I love the slow, calm opening of the door...""it's time for me to release the big gun""."
This has to be one of the best JusticeServed I've seen in a long time.  Thanks for posting.
Howd you break your arm ? Well ..
"""Why he do this without backup?"" __cop turns to his K9 backup__"
"""My partner would like to play tug, if you don't mind."""
The K-9 is the backup
Say hello to my little friend
Definitely had back-up.
I appreciate a man who changes out his wiper blades to give us that ~~clear~~ 240p quality
Looks ruff.
"Police Officers of Reddit:

If that you're that 2nd, or even 3rd cop that showed up, what are you trained to do about the dog? Pretend it's not there? Say ""Who's a good officer of the law?"" and pat it's head? Grab where the 1st officer's hands are, and wait for him to remove the dog? Is the K9 trained to recognize your uniform as ""friendly human, not food?"" Would it respond to you, if the 1st officer was incapacitated? How often do you get to pet the K9? Is that why you applied for the job?

Thanks, in advance, for noticing."
Has to be mental disability. Who punches a cop then just stands there like  he's going to box you.
Dudes got like 4 elbows now
"Former K-9 trainer here, that dog is not properly trained and the officer is not properly trained in use of the dog. 

Once the suspect is on the ground and has given up, the officer should give the dog the command to release him so he can be cuffed. When given the ""OUT"" command, the dog should immediately release the guy. It looks like the cop just let the dog chew on the guy for awhile, and then when he finally decided to get the dog off, the dog had other ideas. I have worked with dogs like this that were trained by departments themselves instead of private training companies. They are loose cannons. The dogs are usually motivated by jute tugs, so during training sessions they just won't perform if they aren't getting to play with their special toy after each bite. Once they bite, they want to hang on for dear life. This is encouraged in training by allowing the dog to take the bite sleeve and prance around shaking it like the dog did to that guy's actual arm. 

If you watch a schutzhund competition, the dogs release instantly on the first command nearly every single time. That's how European police dogs and personal protection dogs are trained. That's how protection dogs for homes of rich clients are trained. That's how dogs trained by most private companies and sold to police departments are trained. That's not how most departments with K-9 programs are training the dogs themselves, and it shows in the amount of lawsuits generated by use of force incidents involving those dogs. Working K-9s with an officer handling them generally do poor in ring and schutzhund sports, which makes you wonder if they should be out in society with all of our lives in their hands every day."
He does have back up.
"Yea let me assault a police officer, this is gonna end without pain or consequence."
"""He should have brought backup.""

Uh, he clearly did bring backup, effective backup at that. Also, the person recording fucking sucks."
Can't a guy do his kegels in the alley in peace anymore without being harassed?
"I mean yeah this dude deserved to be arrested and taken to the ground in a forceful manner, but definitely didn't deserve to have a dog nearly chew his arm off. Could have easily bled to death from this or lost a limb. Like others have said, he could have a mental problem or something, we have no idea. Shit is kinda fucked up how long the dog was gnawing on him. But yeah don't fucking punch a cop, moral of the story as well."
"The thing people seem to forget. You dont fucking start a fight with police (no matter how minor the physical assault) and expect anything less than this, a tazer, a gun. Cops dont deal with your petty ""i feel like fucking with a cop"" shit, theyre trained to keep themselves safe. You start acting like a dumbass, you get treated like a dumbass. They have a dog, why not use the dog? You are the one who fucked up, you are the one who deals with consequences. Under the right circumstances, he would have died given any form of punishment: tazer=cardiac arrest , gun=its a gun dumbass, dog= blood loss/fucked up body part. Fucking with a cop, you gamble with these options. Your choice.

Or you could just, ya knoW, NOT FUCK WITH A COP"
What if he opened the cruiser door and a whole swarm of police bees came streaming out? Now that would've been a real surprise.
"Alright, I don't want to condone violence, but this is one of those times where the guy was asking for it. He literally stood there in boxing stance and punched the cop for no damn reason.

I loved how the cop was like, ""Fuck you, you shit. Lemme get my buddy, he'll show you."""
"dude is wearing white socks with black shoes & pant/s, what a phsycho."
Release the kraken!!
Permanent nerve damage in that arm. Hes probably tripping on drugs.
"After all these years, we finally know who let the dogs out."
Cameraman would starve in a grocery store
At what point in one's life does punching a cop become a good idea?
Looks like he had a back seat full of backup to me.
"Misleading headline. 

He had the best backup."
"I am surprised how chill that officer was... he tried to talk the dude down and then when he swung instead of drawing his gun or a tazer he's like ""ok, diplomacy is over... that's how you want to do this then..."" and opens the door to have dog help take down perp.

I was seriously surprised how relax and calm the officer was in the situation."
Prolly would have gotten the officer arrested if this were here in San Francisco.
QUIT RUFF-SISTING!!
"I went through and upvoted everyone that deserved it....

Apparently someone with dislike for K-9’s is on here downvoting everyone.....

Good dog!!"
"If I’m ever in a situation where I’m faced with the potential that a K9 is going to be released on me, I’m giving up. I’ve seen too many cops episodes where these dogs are having *WAY* too much fun eviscerating somebody’s arm/leg in a death hold."
That sure looked like backup to me.
"i like how he is about to fight back, but then he rethinks it and is like, ""you know what, i got something for you"""
"And the award for Best Narrator goes to...

Wooooiiii THUDwoooiiii THUD
r/killthecameraman.  Jesus.
"The cop thought about it too...he thought about pepper spray, he thought about the tazer and then he was like fuck it get the dog let's make it hurt lol"
That’s a happy dog.
ok but the guy passing by on the bike and deciding to stay and watch the whole thing is my favorite part
The fucking balls of this dude. He's lucky he wasn't immediately shot.
Satisfying
I hope that dog managed to bite his balls off
Truly beautiful - made my day!
Necessary.
Good
He had a shitty officer safety stance. If the officer was responding to a disturbance call he should have approached and stood in a bladed stance in front of the subject. He could have prepared and possibly evaded the punch the subject threw at him
That cop looks like he would have been completely helpless without that dog. Why don't they train them better?
“You’ve just activated my trap card”
"Bet hell think twice before getting high and being an ass again, with anyone. So today, he learned a valuable lesson. He may even thank the cop one day."
He got is hand chew off
The PCP is strong with this one.
"Damn, that officer didn’t want no smoke he had to go get his dog. Well, at least he didn’t shoot him."
Love that sweet instant karma.
Why is nobody talking about that dude's warrior stance?  Guy was feeling himself.
"A punch, eh? Let me just grab something right quick."
Couldn't the cop have just tackled the guy? The punch didn't seem to affect him enough to affect him that much.
that by definition is not... a sucker punch
Doggie treat!
Dont tase me br o shit!
"To those saying he should have tased the guy, The guy had a jacket, the taser would probably not work. A failed taser deployment leaves you open to retaliation."
i know this is a terrible thing to happen but man when that dog came out my eyes lit up. Good BOI
Let me dislocate his arm real quick . -Dog
It appears he does actually have backup. I'd rather have the doge personally.
Can't wait to see this on Donuts channel.
K9 unit inbound
That’s not really a sucker punch.  Dude squared up.
This guy is lucky this wasn't LAPD... fat cops will shoot your ass.
What are you taking about the dog is his back up.
I love how the give the dog a little extra time on that chew toy before they pull him off
Look at that tail go! Someone likes getting up for work in the morning.
Bark bark m'f'er
"He should've made that ""punch"" count.. Idk why he gently tapped him on the face just to get mauled by a dog and then go to jail for a felony.. Not the sharpest tool"
Sergeant Doggo wagging his tail the whole time. Nice.
">Why doesn't he have back up?

The dog: Am I a joke to you?"
"Even though the dog was the main show,  I was waiting for the guy on the bike to something else"
"""Say hello to my little friend!"""
rip that guy's arm
This guy definitely had it coming to him however sometimes cops let dog hurt someone way beyond what is really necessary.
That’s going to leave a mark.
"If anyone’s interested, this is a Newburgh, New York Officer."
"He didn't have backup, but he did have a back-pup"
"Holy shit. Is this classified as necessary force? I mean, that’s kinda intense."
Siklo
He had to have heard the dog. Whenever they’re on Cops the dog is always barking if their human is away from the car.
"Just out of curiosity because I heard somewhere that if you kill the k9 then you will be charged with killing a police officer which is death penalty or life. 

If you attack the k9 like kicking or punching it then what can happen to you legally?"
The way he swings that door open was the perfect combination of “you fucked up” and “I can’t wait to see this.”
Imagine if that dog had bees in his mouth that shot out when he barked...
Good use of escalation of force practice there. (/s)
"He protec, he attac, but most importantly, that criminals a pupper snac"
I hope that dog’s bites are accurate and he doesn’t bite his handler.
"I would have struggled to get my cuffs out, just a bit longer....."
No taser?
But racism in America is why blacks make yo for so much of the prison population. Kay
Oh... he got back up
I'm curious how much damage was done to his arm. Probable won't work right for the rest of his life
"""Mommy, how do I get a 72 hour psych hold?""

""Well dear, first you..."""
"That was just beautiful, made my morning!"
Good. Dont be a dick.
I love the number of comments by people saying the officer should have used his taser instead of the dog.  These are the same people who have seen videos of drug users continue to beat on police after shrugging off multiple taser hits and probably joked about it.  I think the officer reacted correctly because this dude was either mentally ill or on drugs.  That sounds like the odds of the taser working are a lot worse than the odds of the K9 working.
Stop. I only get so hard man.
Does doggo get to keep the hand as a trophy if he rips it off? I’m picturing him having a lil shelf in the back of the car with all his trophies
"Well, he DID have backup"
That dudes arm is now 80/20 ground chuck.
"Dog having a ball, just watch that tail wagging."
Play stupid games win stupid prizes. My guess is mental illness here.
Turn the wipers OFF!!!
Over the top escalation of force.
Oh he’s got backup...
Hey it's Newburgh. Go figure.
He did have backup
It looked like the cop pulled out something from his pocket but when nothing happened he stepped back to open the door. He may have one of those remotes and it just didn't work.
Is that for an internal crate or for the truck door?
"Does the button on the remote say ""Release the hounds!"""
"The guy got what he deserved, let the dog have some fun too. Teach that guy a real lesson"
"I’m curious, not sure if you’d know. But I’d assume that pretty much any officers that may be in contact working with the dog would have to be fairly familiar with it so it never attacks another officer in the heat of the moment? What if there’s some sort of large police response to something involving officers from different precincts?"
"He even gave him a chance. 

“Hey that wasn’t cool. Do I need the dog?”

“Fuck yeah. I’ll jack that mother fucker t.... oh shit!”"
">he steps back to open the door.

I was wondering what he was going for!"
"A K-9 officer used to live across the street from my dad and they’d have them over for dinner often enough, so we’d get to hear his stories. A lot of it was basically him begging people not to be idiots because it makes his job a hell of a lot harder if he has to do any real policing. Especially if he was on patrol on the highway, because if he had to pull someone over and they needed to be arrested, he’d have to call someone else to come take them in because he can’t put someone in the back with the dog."
That door opening was absolutely the coolest thing I have seen in a long long while. Heck i hvent felt like this since I’ve seen tht cool Netflix Punisher show.
"Looks like he reached for the taser at first then thought, “Nah, fuck it. I’ll let Rex have this one.”"
"My sister owns a 100 lb police breed GSD (they cost like $7k btw) and that doggo does NOT fuck around. I literally can't even sit next to my sister on the sofa without triggering his protect mode and he'll either jump on me (not aggressive, just as a GTFO dude) or try to squeeze himself on sofa in between her and me. And I'm not even a stranger, he knows me since he was a 3 month old pup. I play with him and we homies.

I've seen some videos of dogs jumping in when people are fake fighting to see what they do. I wouldn't fake fight with my sister for $1M because I KNOW that dog would come in and fuck me up.

I feel bad for any burglars who break into my sister's house. RIP those guys."
"The way he turns and starts walking back after opening the door...

That's confidence."
I like to think Everytime he does this he says under his breath 'release the hounds' in a Monty Burns accent.
Lol I just read this in Marvin the Martian's voice
"That dog has trained for this their entire life, guarantee it is going to be tail wags for months just thinking about this"
His arm is straight hamburger meat after that.
Don't think he'll be using it to punch any cops anytime soon.
I can't help but think about how bad the dog really got him.
"You have no idea. My German Shepherd/collie mix bit me once accidentally when he dove for a treat that fell in the covers my hand was in. Nearly broke my hand with the little nip before he realized what he did and immediately slammed me over licking me to make sure I was okay. He was the best boy. But man, I feel bad for anybody who ever tried to put their hands on me in front of him."
"Well, hell, dude hit his PARTNER!  and his BEST FRIEND WHO FEEDS HIM!  What dog wouldn't go wolverine on dude!"
"One minute in we were pretty much playing ""how long until the arm comes off"""
"Now imagine if the guy didn't deserve it and was an innocent bystander, and the cop was running to catch up to the loose dog who had got the wrong person

This is why I don't think the police should use dogs. Yeah it worked here but even here, and everyone is hesitating to say it: this was clearly disproportionate retribution. He should have just tazed him, drawn his weapon to subdue or brought another cop along in the first place.

You'll all downvote this because it hurts your justice boners but it makes no difference: when was the last time you didn't expand a ""comment score below threshold"" notice and read the comment out of curiosity?"

The best good boy backup available to mankind.
"Came here to find this comment, damn good back up buddy"
All the easier to eat you with my dear
Exactly! The K9 is literally their partner!
Can we call it barkup?
How your comment and others like yours aren’t the top comments is beyond me. A loyal and situationally aggressive dog is about the best backup you can get.
"They keep using this word, I'm not sure they know what it means."
Cop: \*sigh\* I really wish you wouldn’t have done that. \*opens door\*
"Yeah, a lot better than a rogue mod posting stuff that's completely OT, (and violates multiple rules) and then banning people who call him out on it."
"more than break, mutilate... look up pictures of k9 dog bites."
"Did you notice how freaking HAPPY that dog was? Tail wagging the entire time.

“Officer in need of assistance?!”  
“Fido help!”  
“Fido train many hours for this!”  
“Fido make officer happy with this new toy.”"
He *is* the cavalry.
"Yeah, we were all surprised."
Bit off more than he could chew.
"Correct answer is the dog will bite the first person they identify as a threat, and when you show up as backup the handler will call/pull the K9 off.  If the handler is incapped you call another handler to get the K9.  Typically unless you are a handler yourself they won't listen to you because you don't put the right inflection on your command and they don't know you.  You can pet YOUR K9 as much as you want."
"I'm not a cop but I'm pretty sure the dog is trained to focus on whatever the cop is focused on. Since the cop was interacting with that person, he knew to attack that person. The owner will tell the dog to get off when the other officers take control of the situation."
"Hey I’m just upvoting and commenting so this maybe doesn’t get buried, cause I’d like to see the answer here too."
"When I first got hired I too was terrified of the dogs. Will they recognize that I’m on their side if I jump in to help subdue/cuff someone?

They do. They can differentiate who is the threat based on the energy of the other person. That being said even in uniform I wasn’t going to just go up and pet one. 

Getting chosen as a K-9 Officer is a process. It’s time on the job coupled with your record and reputation as a good cop and interviews. Then lots of training with your dog. You take your dog home with you after work and must care for him/her. Your shifts as a patrol dog handler are almost all late afternoon/night shifts. 


We also had bomb dogs for the airport and transit unit. Trains.

You must also live on a property where a dog run can be placed. Typical back yard is fine. You are not likely to be selected if you live in an apartment. You get a stipend to care for the dog. Food etc.

K-9 officers get only hot calls. It’s a high speed high adrenaline dangerous position. Your not going to be dispatched to take routine cold theft shoplifting calls while your dog waits in the car.

My buddy was shot and his dog was shot and killed on a track. Some yahoos broke into a gun store. 

It’s not for everyone."
K9 mauling beats getting shot too
You'd be surprised at the amount of cocky dumbasses there are in the world. There was kid at my school who punched a cop and then just stood in front of him and laughed at him. Kid got fucking rocked lol.

DRUUUUUUGS
This is the only worthwhile comment in this entire thread
"More if this on reddit please, comment with some weight behind it! Well done."
"I'm curious on your opinion of whether the use of a dog was justified here in the first place. I mean the guy hit the cop but mutilating a body part (which seems inevitable, even if the dog properly responds) doesn't seem like a proportionate response. I'm actually asking too, I don't have enough personal knowledge/experience to come to a conclusion on this."
"We're sitting in here, and I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we in here talking about backup?"
"I posted it on here already, but the cop pointed to the door like he asked him if the guy was gonna calm down or if he needed the to get the dog."
Probably just high. Got distracted by texts. Even says so lol. Also looks like he might be zoomed in already. Can be a bitch to steady.
"Yo, why didn't he bring back-up?

K-9: Am I a joke to you?"
wut?
Filmed on a Nokia
"I'm not sure if you are pro or against what transpired in the video, but I'm not sure that permanent disfigurement is the correct legal repercussion to punching an officer."
"Agree. You can only get away with shit like this in inner cities or obscure small towns, because OP people in San Fran are aware of their homeless population & don't take too kindly to abuse of authority by officers. There are parks around Berkeley where the homeless just chill & no-one bothers them. Or on Telegraph Avenue."
How’s that?
Sounds like a crappy system for the cops then.
Damn. That’s super shitty. The cop handled himself super controlled considering.
"k what happens if he tackles him, lands on him and snaps his neck and accidentally kills him.

or he loses during the tackle and the suspect gets on top... or gets a gun etc...

cops are humans, there is no guarantee and in fact it's guaranteed that they won't win every 1 on 1 fist fight... hence whey they carry things that give them the edge"
It’s a brand new cast!!!!
I thought it was chapstick
"There is a panic button on his radio. First thing he did was hit the panic button, as is standard training in most of the US."
"Ah, good eye!"
"Later on it looks like the door on the othersode of the SUV opened, the dog was probably keyed in on the handler."
I thought he was giving the dude a warning but what you said makes more sense.
"I thought he was radioing to get backup officers before he released his k9. If I had to guess that dude is completely out of it on PCP or something similar, going to fight whatever comes near him."
"That's actually exactly what happened. The initial ruling on the field was he had no remote. Upon further review of the play, he in fact did have a remote that appeared to malfunction possibly due to the rainy weather or a bad battery. This results in an automatic first down for cop and dog cop, and you will not be charged a timeout for use of a challenge. Reset the game clock to *why the fuck did I take this joke so far*"
For the door itself
"I'm just picturing a cop releasing their dog, like ""oh you're so fucked..."" then looking back to see why he's not backing you up and seeing the dog just ripping the seat cushions to pieces"
"From what I've seen they are more like full inserts, like this:
https://www.rayallen.com/k-9-transport

where basically the whole truck door becomes the ""crate"" door."
"A cousin of mine was a K9 unit for a while. He could click the button even pretty far away. The dog was trained that if the door popped open, he should IMMEDIATELY find the officer to help him. He would leap out the car and go into tracking mode sniffing him out. IIRC he was advised to not wear any strong scented deodorant or colognes as well."
It's the 'Cry havoc' button
Excellent.
nom nom nom
If you don’t already know that attacking a cop isn’t smart then he probably didn’t learn much cause he’s a fuckin idiot
"That's always a danger.  Dogs can be unpredictable, especially when excited.  I've seen quite a few police videos of chases where they broadcast something like "" K9 unit advises officers not to give chase when he [the suspect] bails"".  I assume that's because they want no one else running within site of the dog, or the dog could get confused and latch onto one of the other cops."
"Dogs are taught to attack on command. When the door is opened with the remote it makes an audible pop, which is also an attack command. Once they attack, they don’t let up until pulled off. 

It is dangerous to pop the door when too many people are around, the dog will get confused on who to attack and potentially pick the wrong person. Even if the owning officer is engaged in combat, the dog may choose to attach someone else they see as a threat. 

Most people are savvy to the dog, usually just the threat of popping the door is enough to get folks to cooperate. 

Source: brother in law is K9 cop"
All cops are taught some physical techniques to restrain a k9  but there's always a chance of an accidental bite. The rule of thumb: stay behind the handler.
"It has happened, but some dogs just aren't really suited for the job and you can't tell that until they are on the streets.  Same with the 2 legger cops.  Mostly the dog sort of recognizes the uni, plus the dog probably has been introduced and hangs out with the other cops in the area.  Probably even goes to the same bar with his partner.  Dogs can tell friend from foe, but some dogs are just too aggro.  YOu want a dog willing to attack, but for good reason.  This dog SAW DUDE HIT HIS PARTNER.  You do that with any cop, they will put you in a world of hurt."
"I really want to know what he says when he points back to the car! 

“You want to dance with my partner?”

Meth tends to negate the shock value of a taser. He had plenty of time to decide how to respond. He could have pulled his gun but knew the guy wasn’t going to back down.  The dog was probably the least lethal option available to him."
"One time in college we got stopped by a K-9 unit, as we were being drunk and loud bouncing from one party in our apartment complex to the next, as you do at that age. He yelled out the window, ""don't run or I'll set the dog on you and I promise he can run faster."" (it was in a really shady area and we just finished setting off fireworks in the field adjacent to the complex, so they prolly got called on suspicion of gunshots. Not that real gunshots weren't a rarity, hence the threat and heightened caution. Plus there was 3 of us)

However, we were pretty tanked and I had half the remains of a 30pk under one arm and a couple pounds worth of mortars under the other, so I assured him that he needn't worry as running was not an ability we possessed at that moment. He made us dump out the beers on the sidewalk, douse the fireworks in water (generously borrowed from a neighbor in the nearest apartment who came out to see what was going on - which is how we met our stoner friends from MI), and then told us to make our way home.

Anyway, that's the closest I've ever been to being nommed on by a K-9 unit, and by the looks of that dog he was itching to. I sure as shit wasn't ready to tempt him."
This made me realize I need to watch it with the audio. It looks excessive without knowing he said all that shit. Thank you lol I feel a little bit better just hard seeing a guy get his arm totally fucked like that
"Looks like he steps back and point at the car asking him if he wants the dog. Dude should have just laid down at that point, he had his chance"
"He's going to have dreams about gnawing into that arm long into his retirement.

What a good boy.. the best boy."
Full on red crayon
"From an old thread:

>
Anyone who flees on foot when the cops have a dog is a god damned moron.

At that point, you can either go to prison, or go to the hospital and then go to prison. You're not going to outrun any German Shepherd, and chasing and biting people is literally this specific dog's favorite thing. Motherfucker loves to bite people. He's probably spent most of his life, since he was a puppy, being trained to chase and bite motherfuckers. This shit is like the Super Bowl and Grad night all rolled together for him.

You see how he's pulling on his harness? He's like ""FUCKING, LET ME GO! LET ME BITE HIM! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU I'M A DOG! I'M A DOOOOOOG FUCK YOOOOU!

He does that every time, and his handler pretty much NEVER lets him do his thing. And now, this time, miraculously, he has. He's let go of the harness, and now this majestic beast is at last fulfilling his purpose as a living missile, and my god is he ever thrilled about it.

Eerily similar to how US Marines feel when they finally get to deploy.
Just tootin in his sleep.
"Right? You can see his tail wagging the whole time like it's just a game of tug of war, and the dog is definitely winning. He's so happy to do his job protecting his human."
Looks like it broke
It looked like they had to pry the dog off of him. He should be trained to let go on cue once they’ve got the situation under control. Dudes arm is toast

"Why did I listen?

Don't google: K9 dog bite wound"
"Thank you so much for the information!

I'm sure I'll only continue to think of questions, if you'd be willing to answer.

Do you need to 'register' the dogs credentials with the department? Like, if your K9 was also trained in tracking & recovery, or trained in German. Did this video show an automated door that failed to open remotely?"
"You are a kind, and generous person. Your lucky numbers are 3, 7, and 42.

(I bet that's why they apply for the job.)"
"Thank you for your input. Kind of you to share. You, and those you mentioned, are appreciated."
Could also be all of the above.
He was treated for intoxication at the hospital.
"Yep, I think the cop showed great restraint when he didn't take out his gun when the dope punched him.  He escalated but only a measured escalation with the dog."
"Naw, it could definitely be a meth/crack head"
What? Near 100% chance that its a mentally ill person? Drugs are usually the first suspect when someone is doing something that is out of the norm. Like punching a cop for example.
If they don’t have Down syndrome how the fuck are you supposed to tell the difference between drugs and a mental disability? Jfc lol
"Doesnt really matter. In modern society all people should be upheld to the same laws. Just because your dog told you to punch a cop doesnt make it fine, reasonable, or important. Assault is assault"
"“Unfortunately cops don’t know and aren’t trained how to handle mentally ill”

No that’s false. Police departments have made great strides in learning how to handle mental illness and deal with situations like this. While they aren’t perfect they’re working on it with a very limited budget. The other issue is the cop worries about his life and will protect himself adequately. 

Also we have no idea if the person is mentally ill or isn’t; or under the influence of drugs/alcohol. Lots of people make dumb decisions when they’re doped up or sauced. I think he handled the situation very poorly especially with the use of a K9 (using a K9 is just shy of lethal force) he should have warned the person he was going to sic his dog on him. 

Just need to be careful and not use mental illness as a crutch when it could be possible the persons doped up or drunk. 

Source: I’m in my city’s citizen police academy and we just had a fire deputy chief come in talking about mental health training/mental health for officers and they touched on these types of instances"
He was just doing some sumo squats in the ally and this cops all up in his grill......
Explanations are not excuses. Mental illness explains the behaviour; it does not mean the behaviour is excused (ie free from consequences).
Well that's what darwinism is for.
Or drugs. Or both.
"Well tbf the cop doesn't really have time to diagnose a mental illness in this situation, suspect could've also been high. This cop responded with appropriate force to defend himself. He didn't over react with a gun he simply tried to subdue the suspect. This is about the best police work you can ask for when someone is looking to fight everybody"
"I think you’re mistaking mentally ill with stupid. 

Cops do receive mental disability training (although it’s less likely in smaller towns), the only question is if, with the litany of things they have to keep in their mind during a confrontation, the cops decide to exercise that caution.

The cop messing up here could mean that him and any nearby bystander could be potentially injured or worse. Cops can’t take that risk which is why many choose to contain the situation immediately instead of spending to much time deliberating.

Regardless of that, nothing about this dumbass screams mental disability. He seemed clearly coherent of his actions when he hit and tried to provoke a police officer. Odds are he’s just an idiot or high on something or both."
"> theres a near 100% chance you are correct that this is a mentally ill person.

That’s not a reasonable conclusion. He could be on drugs."
"It's hard to make that judgement without hearing the call that went out over the radio. If this guy was reported to have a weapon, be mentally deranged, high on angel dust, etc, the extremely close distance makes the use of any other less than lethal means very risky. A taser needs enough spread on the prongs to cause NMI, which is impossible to get at this distance. It also looks like the suspect is wearing enough clothes that it wouldn't be a good chance at working anyway. The officer looks bigger and stronger than the suspect, but there are 150lb UFC fighters who could kick that cops ass. I'm going to say it was justified, but that doesn't always mean it was necessary. Sometimes you're justified to shoot a guy until your mag is empty, but if you're able to de escalate the situation, that's obviously the better choice."
It seems completly unethical to unleash an attack dog on someone outside of situations where lives are at stake
"Because he's sitting there saying ""Why didn't he bring backup?"" while said backup is currently pulling the perp down. Thus, he would starve in a grocery store saying ""Where is all the food?"" when it's right in front of him."
"This is /r/JusticeServed.
They just don’t like black people here"
Oh poor cops lmao
It was certainly chapstick. That's very important in situations like that. All cops carry chapstick.

Could have been his can of whoop ass.
"Yup. Most of them also broadcast GPS location and turn the mic on (or at least are capable of being programmed that way). This way dispatch instantly gets a readout of location the panic button was pressed, where the radio is now, and unit in distress (by radio ID) and can listen in on what's going on.

Usually it's the first thing they hit before an altercation. This way, they can do radio calls hands-free, and know that backup can find them while they're otherwise occupied.

It's been one hour and no ones made a joke about standard training for police in the US. Good on us
Hm
I can guarantee you he did not hit his red button on his radio. He doesn’t need all frequency to stop because someone hit him in the face. This isn’t a legbail or shots fired call dude.
Yes why did you
It looks like he tried to open it remotely but it didnt activate. That's why he walked back and manually opened the door. I could be wrong.
There are remote releases that drop the windows too
Lmfao

Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of public protection and service.
"> Once they attack, they don’t let up until pulled off.

and sometimes not even then!

I kind of hate police dogs. I've seen so many videos of poorly trained dogs that were engaged for no real reason, that the officer is unable to disengage, causing undue pain and suffering to the citizen."
I didn’t know that about meth vs taser. I knew there had to be a reason he went for the fur missile and not the sparkle thrower
"Not to mention, it is usually policy to only use a taser when you have backup with deadly force ready. Taser first, but not by yourself."
">Meth tends to negate the shock value of a taser. 

That's not true. Tasers, in ideal circumstances, cause your muscles to seize up, regardless of the drugs you're on.

My guess is he in part decided against a taser was due to the guy's clothes."
"Meth doesn't negate the direct muscle cramping that a well-applied taser shot will cause.

A thick jacket may keep the probes from making/keeping good contact though, and now you have an unharmed but very pissed methhead."

Honestly it wouldn’t surprise me. A German Shepard’s bite force is actually really fucking insane if they legitimately want to dig into whatever they’re biting.
Good.

Some of the dogs understand commands in German or Czechoslovakian as they get their initial training there. The new handler in the US must learn these commands obviously."

"Or none of the above, if we are being thorough."
Makes sense
The cop showed great restraint by not shooting him? What kind of dumbass I want to be John Wayne world are you living in son?
"Great restraint. ""A guy hit me. I should kill him"". Sure perfect logic."
"Showed great restraint? The dog probably mutilated his arm. Just use a taser if you want to show restraint. The dog attacked him and then the cop started punching him in the head lol. The guy who punched the cop is in the wrong, yes, but there were better options to subdue him."
"I’m probably in the wrong sub to make this point but...In modern society, punishment is handed down by a judge or jury. Moreover, mental state plays a role in the amount of culpability the justice system applies to a crime. 

If this person is mentally ill and does not understand the gravity of his actions, he should not be judged on the same grounds as someone who willfully disregards the law.  

That’s not my opinion. That is how the US penal code is designed for these types of crimes. 

Apprehension of a violent criminal does not always require him to be viciously injured by the police. That is not considered to be justice in a modern society, nor does it necessarily uphold the ideals that the justice system is designed to protect."
I agree with that however the cats wishes must be followed if I want to wake up in the morning .
"All people being held to the same standard of law requires all people to be rational, and that just isn’t the case. A sane person (and most people, as most people are sane) should listen to the law, generally speaking. Some people are bad and deserve to go to jail. There’s no dispute there. Some mentally unwell people cannot abide by the law, and it is not their fault, illness can take away their rationality. 

Mentally ill people need help, and we can’t blame them for being mentally ill. We can’t blame an officer for defending themselves, police officers deal with difficult situations as part of their job and sometimes noticing that someone is mentally ill can be difficult if not outright impossible, especially in the middle of a confrontation. In an ideal world however, I’d hope that everyone would want someone that is mentally ill to not suffer for their illness in the form of being on the receiving end of an officer defending themselves, and even less so to suffer by being sent to jail for years.

As a last little point, mental illness can hypothetically happen to anyone, though unlikely. Our brains are delicate things. If you don’t understand unfortunate people with mental illness, try to put yourself in their shoes. 

Would you want to get beat down by an officer, and get sent to jail for years for assaulting an officer while you were unable to think properly? Would that be fair or reasonable? I’d hope people would try to help me if that happened to me."
"In modern society, people who suffer mental illness should receive care, not punishment.
  
Or we'll treat autism and paranoia in jail."
"Even though it may be fucked up on my part, I feel like just because someone thought it was OKAY to kill someone (insanity plea) should actually increase their sentence, someone who kills, trying to cover it up and all, knows what they are doing is bad, and prison time will teach them, someone who thinks it fine to kill someone is far more likely to repeat crimes."
"Laws are not absolute, and context is allowed to be taken into account. For example, it is illegal to drive on the shoulder of the highway; however, if you suffer a stroke and drive off the road, we shouldn’t arrest you for reckless driving.

Same for speeding.. it is against the law to speed, but if your kid is in the backseat having a medical emergency, it is ok to speed to the hospital."
Don't buy it.
"/r/Im14AndThisIsDeep material right here ""mental illness is no excuse !!11!!"""
Yep. You’re responsible for your mental illness even if it’s not your fault you have it.
"I had a relative who was a jail psychiatrist for years before going into private practice. They used to say quite candidly ""even crazy people know right from wrong."" So yeah, I'm 100% with you on this."
"Context is important and that's something sorely lacking in law enforcement.  Systemic issues are completely ignored saying ""the law is the last"" but if rich people can hire the best lawyers and get off with no problem, we can't really say the law is the law now can we?"
This is incredibly simple-minded.
"That's not how the criminal justice system works. Under your philosophy, a 5 year old is held as accountable as a 40 year old. Being unable to discern right from wrong or predict likely consequences for an action is *absolutely* relevant in how punishment and 'justice' is dealt.

Also this 

> Just because your dog told you to punch a cop doesnt make it fine, reasonable, or important. Assault is assault 

Is a strawman argument. No one is suggesting you should get away with a crime or it be ""fine"" because you're mentally ill, it just means punishment must be adjusted to suit the needs of both the perpetrator and society in general. It does not aid us to lock up a mentally ill person in a regular prison, which is why we have psychiatric facilities that are better equipped to rehabilitate.

What you're describing isn't justice, it's vengeance."
"I dont think your comment makes much sense. 

A retarted person should and often times get more leeway in interactions with cops or judges

Logic follows that documented mentally ill people should get similar treatment."
Lmao
Can you dumb it down a little?
Just borrow some from the *school nurse*. I know *she* has *like* five *sticks* in her drawer
"While those features are available, ""most"" only open the mic for a period of time and let the dispatcher know which radio set it off. While GPS is a feature all the major radio companies offer, I know of precious few departments that have the kind of money to spend on that."
"I totally agree. I did 20 + years in patrol in a major metropolitan city and I never pushed that button once.

It was designed for and we were told/trained that it is only to be used say for example if you can’t speak. For example if someone has the drop on you and you can’t key your mike or you are gurgling and drowning in your own blood.

Dire dire emergencies only. If it’s pressed for anything less or on accident it’s a combination of embarrassment and ass chewing.

If you push it everyone and everything is dropping what they are doing and coming."
I think he did try the remote but it didnt work. I've talked to a K9 officer and he tries to use the remote as little as possible so he doesnt have to rely on it.
It's probably fail safe to prevent accidental release so less reliable than it should be.
"Was just about to say this. 
I can’t remember where I saw it, but there was a dash cam video that showed the dog jumping through the window to help his partner who pressed his button."
"I will title this ""farva from super troopers gets a k9""


But then the dog does eventually get out and somewhwat helps with the takedown.  Why?  Dog is sluggish from lunch.  It was fed donuts and chicken wings.

Guy knocks cop on the ground and they are sorta arms locked up.  Dog stops, tilts his head and looks at them.  Crook pauses then laughs as doing isn't doing anything.  Dog starts.....humping motion?    Cop is pissed.

Nope, dog projectile vomits donuts and spicy wings onto bad guys face.  Bad guy keels over as it's like pepper spray.  Dog feels better and now starts biting the fuck out of bad guy.

Farva has some vomit on him.  But he's mostly pissed the dog threw up that lunch he bought for the dog.

Backup/the chief arrive later and are astounded at how the dog is now 100%, head to toe covered with orange vomit.

Farva, and the car are cleaned off with a garden hose.

Everyone else papmers the dog to clean her.  The dog is female, they put a sexual harassment warning on farvas file.  Because he's received more than 5 warnings this week, he's back to desk duty for the rest of the quarter."
To feel fancy.
Because a taser is almost guaranteed not to make contact through that heavy clothing.
"Frequent meth users are not only resistant to pain, but chronically dehydrated. Electricity doesn't conduct as well in a dehydrated perp."
Tasers are dog shit a lot of the time against anything.
"I swear I could find a cite on that but my Google fu is failing me. All the results indicate a possible meth taser heart complication that was not backed up in a single study / publicity stunt with goats. 

I have anecdotically heard from multiple LEO that people on Meth ignore all damage including a taser. Of course the taser causes muscle seizures, but does it subdue someone on meth or do they get right back up?"
Layers of clothing make the prongs not stick.
"I’m this case I feel like the dog was the least deadly force available. You can almost see the officer going through is options. He first reaches for his gun, but recognized the suspect isn’t currently attacking. I hope he was wearing a body cam and audio is somewhere on the intertubes."
Your friends dad is a German Shepard?
Belgian Mals live to be 12-14 years old. They can operate as working dogs up to 6-9 years old. Dunno where you got that info from
That’s just the breed. Nothing to do with their work.
"My uncle and cousin are both K9 officers, the 3 dogs they had have lived to be 11, 11 and 12 and the one my cousin is still working is already 9. Dying that young is far from normal."
Pretty sure they’re only put into service for that long. They live full lives lol
This is not true.
"I see some of the bomb sniffing dogs at my work. They are retired around 7-8 years so long as their health and weigh keeps up. Retirement for them is staying home and enjoying nice relaxing days. Although the dogs I’ve met would probably prefer working to relaxing. 

Also when they are retired, the handler gets to keep them, but they also have to deal with the medical bills associated with the pup. I have donated to the charity run for them so it gets the handlers and dogs assistance for medical bills if needed. Check out pawsofhonor.org if you’d like to help the pups and handlers."
"That span seems to be their working lives, not their entire lifespan."
Are you sure it that is the lifetime and not the retirement age?
"Errrr my old partner was a GSD K9 breeder and most of them lived to at least 10 before they started even getting hip issues. Quality of life with proper diet could be maintained well after that.

Maybe you misheard about how long pups would stay in service?"
My dad’s cop dog lived to be 12.
"That's just plain wrong. My uncle retired two dogs while working, both GS, and they both lived to 13 and 14 respectively."
This is not true at all. German shepherds and Belgian malinois can easily live to 12 or 13 years.
"...that's not accurate at all, a simple google search shows otherwise. 11-14. For a Mal."
"I was a K9 handler with a Mal for 4 years. I had him until he was 7 (was 3 when I got him). He’s still working and is perfectly healthy at 10  with a new handler (I advanced). He will work until he is 12 or so barring any injuries. He and I have been bit by dogs together, stabbed together and have even gone off a small cliff together. These dogs are tough. Arthritis and his joints will eventually give out, but not because of his work, that’s just natural in all dogs when they get that age.

My partner is the goodest boi and he is hecken tough. They have a great life and in my humble opinion, a better life than mere pets. They get to ride in a car with a custom kennel and see the world, they are appreciated and loved by all."
I thought it was because the dog had the jacket and the guy quit fighting. Doesn't look like it is through the arm. Right?
Anything but the smallest dog has an incredible bite force when they mean it. Even small dogs do but just relative to their size I’m sure.
"The dogs normally won’t let go until you are on the ground and not twitching.

Except they are fucking gnawing your limb"
"You do...but if you knew anything about dogs you would know that isn’t always effective and isn’t a make or break thing for working dogs, nor should it be"
"My wrist pains are flaring up watching this, I can only imagine how much damage that dog did holding on that long. I mean yeah, fuck him up, but damn that seems a bit excessive if he had his arm broke and floppy like that, not to mention the infections he'll probably get from the puncture wounds."
"He was so happy to help, best boy...."
"Ohhhh this fucking drought is killing me. I'm spending all my extra time playing pubg instead of watching uncle chael. 
  
The hype train needs some fuel."
How do I delete someone else’s comment
We're at the point where we're congratulating any cop that doesn't shoot on sight.
"Excuse me, but this is Reddit where we applaud excessive force and infringement on rights by a cop as long as it's a cute wittle doggie."
"Well, that's just the way it is with cats."
Why would you want to wake up in the morning?
"An insanity plea isn't someone saying they thought it was fine to do what they did, it's someone saying they didn't understand what they were doing. It's usually some sort of acute psychotic break with delusion, they're literally perceiving the world differently."
"just for the record, successful insanity pleas do not reduce your sentence or get you off scot free. Mental institutions are generally really awful places."
"Sometimes it actually does increase their sentence.  Stints at mental institutions are uncapped, and they have a bad reputation for holding people longer than they should through misdiagnosis.  Someone who gets ""off"" on the insanity defense and is institutionalised may actually spend the rest of their life in said institution as they can simply refuse to release them, whereas if they're sentenced to prison they'd have a definite cap on their sentence, and may be released early on parole for good behaviour.

Of course, the insanity defence is realistically a lot less prevalent than popular media would make us think, as they need to prove that insanity.  It's not like they plead insanity, stay in a mental institution for a few years, and walk off scott-free, although there probably are cases where that's happened as it's obviously a very imperfect system."
"If I’m not mistaken, in the case of the law, if you can prove someone understands the consequences of their crime, and planned it and did t with full intent, then the “insanity” defense doesn’t apply. To be successful in that defense, you basically have to prove that your client is so detached from reality he did not know what he was doing or understand the consequences of it. 

I feel free to correct me if I’m wrong."
"What does ""increase their sentence"" mean? Of course, everyone would agree that a violent, medically insane person does not belong in society, but treating their sentence like a mentally capable person makes no sense. 

In both cases, the goal would be to rehabilitate them so that they can safely rejoin society. Also, in America at least, there is absolutely a ""punishment"" aspect involved with a prison sentence. Now, a punishment makes no sense for a truly mentally incapacitated person: that'd be cruel and do no good. Hopefully we agree on that?

If your post is implying that we should ""increase"" the punishment aspect of a sentence for mentally incapacitated people- then yes, that's fucked up. If you're just saying that the standard for allowing them to rejoin society should be ""higher"", then sure, that's up for debate."
Word.
"Insanity plea doesn't get you out of jail it gets you into the psych ward. Possibly a lesser sentence and *possibly* a better alternative to wherever you would be going otherwise, but you have to be severely misinformed to think that an insanity plea is a get-out-of-jail-free card"
"You need to look into insanity pleas beyond just what you see on tv. For example, the only insanity pleas that fly in Missouri is if you can prove you didn't actually know you were killing people, so if you had schizophrenia and you saw certain people as demons so you tried to kill them then you get an indefinite stay in a state run mental health facility"
You should read into what you actually need to show to prevail on an insanity defense and what the result of that is. It’s not a get out of jail free card for anyone who thinks it’s ok to kill people.
"Insanity plea it's not for people who just ""think that killing is okay"" it's for people that can't think straight, and everything else you said you are assuming the mentally ill person can think straight."
That’s a pretty good take
"Yeah the one scenario is much easier to sympathize with and is arguably way less morally offensive, but that in no way affects how you need to deal with it. Feel bad as you lock them up, but lock them the hell up none the less (hopefully somewhere conducive to treatment as compared to punishment though)"
"I’m sorry, the second point doesn’t fly

Plenty of examples of where the driver has been convicted. They may have their sentence reduced, but they still receive a conviction. The response is “call an ambulance”."
How else are we gonna keep our privately owned prisons filled and their politician investors happy?
That’s just completely and totally fucking wrong.
Camera dum
"Yeah, what I described is vv fancy pants and ideal. It was more to illustrate the panic button's importance in the order of operations than it was to state that this exact scenario was in place. Only the most posh/well-funded of departments would have all these bells and whistles."
"A shit ton of cars come with that standard tho if you have a remote, just push and hold open button to open windows and hold lock to lock windows."
I would buy that dvd. Only other DVD I've bout in a 5 years was super troopers 2. Super Snooters K 9-5 would be an excellent edition to the collection
Oh.  I see.  Thank you.
Makes a lot of sense.
"This is wrong. 

Conductivity will not change significantly depending on the hydration level of a living human. There's more current in a taser than your nerves (kinda the point) and if you ""are dehydrated enough to not conduct a taser shock"", you're too dehydrated for your nerves to work, performing functions such as sense of touch, keeping you upright, or pumping your heart."
That would be interesting to learn. I’ll ask a cop buddy next time I see him.
I would love to see goats on meth.
i could see someone high on such a powerful stimulant succumbing to fibrillation after taking a shock from a taser.
"From my understanding it's that tasers tend to not be a long lasting take down. You seize when it's active, and then you're just tired/sore when it stops. The stopping power comes from the threat of it happening again. So when you're already jacked up on meth, you're certainly not going to be tired, and that soreness is going to be completely ignored. At that point the police officer is essentially required to be actively tasing for any effect, and a long term tase is probably not the best thing for a person."
"oh for sure. Besides, it's just like a fast car, sometimes you just gotta let them stretch their legs a little. That dog is gonna be happy for months to come."
And an absolute unit of one by the sounds of it.
"It's mostly to do with the German Shepards that used to be used as service dogs. Some departments still utilize them today, though I believe Belgians are now the dog of choice."
This is a GSD
Are you sure it’s not a German Shepard?
That wasn’t a Mal. That was a GSD
"Typical life expectancy for a shepherd is 9-13 years, definitely not ‘just the breed’."
"Actually they can only work for so long until they have to be retired. Normally the dog lives with the officer and once the dog is retired they go into depression because they are no longer working. It’s that the handler leaves them everyday and it can cause the dog a lot of stress that often leads to an early death.  

It can be even worse if the handler is assigned a new K9 because the pupper sees the handler leave every day not only without them but also a new K9."
"We’ve never had one make it past 10, but most get to 9. We also like to give them a couple of years to lay in the sun, because they won’t stop working on their own. 

So, who gets him when he retires?  We go by the handler who had him the longest gets first dibs."
I think I can see dudes hand out the end of his sleeve
"Definitely the dog got the meat, No chance it was just the coat.

I'd rather get manhandled by half the force than one of these dogs, damn."
dude definitely got his arm broken dude
It's almost certainly broken. Probably in a few places.
"When a dog's blood is up it kinda stops listening.  The best way to separate a dog (from a person or from another dog) is to anchor the other entity somehow and then grab the dog's back legs ""wheelbarrow style"" and begin walking backward and to one side."
I was so afraid best boy might injure his teeth.  I’m so glad he’s ok
"Still, someone like that shouldnt be allowed in public"
I visit clients in State Hospitals (pc way of saying Sanitarium) and IMDs all over California and I can attest that Prison is a significant upgrade.
You're very welcome.
"heres a video showing the good vs bad of tasers that is quite useful

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yaie4bzsFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yaie4bzsFI)"
"I think that was supposed to be a joke. Otherwise it makes absolutely no sense, because you would have to be so dehydrated that your nervous system is impaired and you can't barely move, in which case you would be long past dead."
This is now top of my non-political discussions for Thanksgiving. I’ll try to remember to post an update.
Taser amount of effective or ineffectiveness is dependent on the spread of the prongs and good contact (i.e. heavy clothing can prevent good prong contact) I’ve never had a deployment malfunction that was based on how high someone is. If he gets up you run the cycle again until you either get compliance or cuff him “under power” while the taser is cycling.
"It depends honestly, with a good regiment of joint supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin, the effects of hip displasia(sp?) can be reduced. I've owned two GSDs in my life so far, both pure bred. Both lived to about 13-14 years old."
"Yes I know the US seems to be using Belgian Mals more. Here in Sweden however 70% of police dogs are German Shephers, not sure why."
"It could very well be yes, afaik GSDs have lower life expectancies than Belgians Mals"
It's probably the cocaine
"I don't know what that guy is talking about, a colleague of mine keeps retired police dogs and he has 5 who are all plenty old.

His house is also burglar proof."
Their lifespan is no different than any other of their breed. Their “working “ lifespan is about eight years and then they are usually retired to the care of their partners.
"It’s not accurate. We retire them around 9 or 10 depending on the dog. Most make it to 12 or 13. My last retired dog made it to 13. They get good food, lots of exercise, and they get better vet care than most pets.  

I work one of the larger K-9 units in Ca. And Shepard’s are getting pretty rare. Mostly malinois and Dutch Shepard’s now in large part due to GSD’s health issues."
"Typical retirement age of a police k9 is between 6-9 years old. Regardless of breed. That is not the typical life expectancy of police dogs. Not even military dogs. 

The orginal commentor is spreading false information. A German Sheppard will retire and live a couple more years barring any underlying health conditions."
"Where are you that they retire K9s in the same home that a new working dog is in?  I've done a lot of work with LE units and in my experience they almost always rehome them if the handler is getting a new dog.

Edit:  FWIW my old PD took the handlers off rotation for a few years when their dog retired and left the dog with them.  It was easier to rotate handlers because they could start working up new dogs as the active units got older to limit downtime, and to give the old handlers coming off a break.  A K9 rotation is absolutely exhausting, 32-40 hour work week on top of constant training with the dog, and the retired dogs still need a lot of time because you have to ""retrain"" them to new duties to keep them happy.  Working dogs never really want to stop working at least to some degree, so many officers casually train them after retirement, train them to hunt, use them for search and rescue, train them on agility, etc even after they retire."
"Nah, for this particular situation a breaker bar or a “hard out” is the best suited to avoid a reattack or a negligent bite while the dog is in drive."
Hey quit hounding up on these guys.
Which is why you will likely be civilly committed for life to a mental institution. Are you under the impression that people successfully plead insanity and then just go free?
"Absolutely, but punishing them *more* than someone who knew what they were doing is absurd, arguably punishing them as much as is absurd.

Imagine you spend days being followed. You're sure you're being followed, you hear the footsteps behind you, you see someone slip around a corner every time you turn around, you're sure they're in your house at night but you can never find them. You're terrified and one day someone startles you, you club them over the head with something close at hand sure they were going to hurt you.

Comment
"1) what kind of fish lurks in the ground water

2) how the hell did a combo of eggs, mentos(?) and coke help him fish? Did it scare them to the surface or something?

3)what the fuck"
So basically he tear-gassed the fishes out of the hole.
wonder how long he must have grinded to get his fishing level up
"The hole is usually connected to a nearby river that is always overpopulated with Catfish, but catching them in the river can be hard, so this gent puts mentos in the hole to wait, adds the egg because it's the real bait here, the fish comes to eat the egg and then he pours in coke and it adds the mentos coke reaction of pushing all the oxygen out of the water and the fish since it's a fish and facing forward tries to swim forward so it can keep breathing (because the process of adding so much CO2((I believe)) to the water at once effectively makes the water unbreathable and begins drowning the fish.

Tl;dr egg bait, coke and mentos make bubbly, fish runs from bubbly, man grabs."
"2nd fish comes out like “Bitch, where you take my wife!?”"
I'm mortified and curious on what kind of fucking fish lives underground
I’ve never watched something so incredibly compelling
oi wheres the sound.
"EXPLANATION: The egg is the bait, the scent attracts the fish at first, then once the soda goes in, it's starts creating a ton of CO2, suffocating the fish, the fish then thinks ""oh, if I go near/to the surface and near the bait, I'll be able to breathe AND get food"""

"I think those are catfish and the coke/mentos/eggs combo reduces the oxygen in the water, causing the fish to move upwards where there is more oxygen"
">3)what the fuck

My thoughts exactly."
Nobody answered why there are fish in a hole
"All he needed was the mentos, or any product with menthol. I've seen this done with toothpaste also."
It’s the marinade and egg wash. They don’t show it but they dredge it in Panko and deep fry it immediately.
4) Pepsi ok?
"The eggs, mentos, and cola are actually a pre seasoning."
"The fish live in a river that the the hole is beside and I think that type can dig through the ground so the egg baits them to that area while the coke gets rid of the oxygen. I'm fairly certain the mentos didn't do much since the reaction only happens with *diet* coke. They have no oxygen so they swim up to look for some.

Edit: Apparently the mentos truck works with other sodas too"
Ralph Simmons of the Hill Tribe
"So, this is all a guess, but, I know Catfish live in holes in the side of the river, which are generally underground, and this makes them a pain the get because they can bite you pretty bad (as you can somewhat see in the video, from the blood kn the guys arm) so just grabbing them isn’t a great idea unless you have the proper protection. What this clever fellow seems to be doing is he first dug down and intercepted their burrow, then uses the egg as bait perhaps and the mentos and soda to either disturb or confuse the fish. Then he reaches in, grabs its, and its a catch! If someone really knows whats going on here please do tell me how close I was to the truth!"
Hong Kong fish?
Mentos.  The freshmaker.
Idk barehanding catfish is pretty solid xp/hr. They're about to nerf it though with the next patch in the name of QOL.
Nice.
Final Fantasy XV flashbacks.
I don't think the egg is bait. It seems like a cheap way of increasing surface tension and preventing the bubbles from the mentos from just rising into the air and popping.

I'm not gonna challenge your theory since I'm not a redneck fisherman but if I was a suffocating fish I certainly won't be thinking of food. I would swim up regardless.

"He's only a master fisherman, not a master fish handler."
"Cat fish have several barbs on the dorsal and pectoral fins, and they don’t feel great if you get stuck with them. Looks like he caught one at some point because his left fore arm is bleeding by the end of it."

"Nah, noodling is when you make a fist and stick your arm in the water, then pulling out when a catfish tries to eat your arm."
Noodling is more stick your body part in a hole and hope there is a catfish inside to bite it. This is more like suffocating the fish and the grab it when it comes up for air.
hes just making the broth for the ramen
Still got the fish though. Does this not qualify as fishing? (I really don’t know)
Do you recognize the bodies in the water
"Not only did he get creative with the bate, he mastered the bate."
"Yeah, pretty much. He's suffocating the fish and forcing them to come upward for air and then capturing them."
or maybe just don't kill them at all
I think the eggs are for bait
"The egg creates a thick film layer, increasing the surface tension on top of the water. The effect of this is that when the mentos begin to fizz, they don't rise to the surface and pop into the air. The yolk keeps them contained in the hole and the water."
The hole will have been dug near/next to a river.
Isn't it supposed to be diet coke? Or is it really just mentos with any carbonated drink?
I'm offended.
"You can do it with any soda, must people use diet coke though because: 1. It has a larger reaction by a little bit and 2. It's not sticky

https://youtu.be/iS2vG1o7Op4

Edit: a word"
Oh thanks
Catfish bites don't hurt. It's the spiny bones they have poking out the side that stab you and hurt like FFFFFFFFFF.
"Im thinking the egg makes it very hard to breathe once it gets mixed up by the mentos and the coke. It forces them to move up towards the top, away from the egg/water/mentos-coke mixture."
"If I’m remembering right from when I saw this somewhere else on Reddit (or maybe it was Twitter) he’s using Coke and mentos to mimic the “turbulence” (best word I could think of) of rain, which, along with the egg, lures the fish out. I might be misremembering this tho."
High five friend!

A fellow intellectual I see
The fishmaker
"impressive knowledge this sounds professional as hell, I'll take your word for it"
I think so too. I was wondering where the hell were all the bubbles from the mentos + coke combination. It seems like the egg captured all that fleeing gas and turned the hole into a death chamber for fish.

"Take my upvote for ""enbucketed"""
Use raw eggs to ensure that only the swollest of fitness oriented catfish are lured.
"I think the eggs are bait, and then the mentos+coke forces them upwards to the surface, because, well, mentos+coke."

I'm keeping this forever cause it's amazing knowledge
"Yup, some cocktails/drinks use just a little bit of egg whites to make them frothier/hold onto their fizz for the same reason. I remember I thought my bartender buddy was crazy the first time he did it."
"After questioning the same thing on reddit people told me that it's done with diet coke as there's no sugar in it so the mess doesn't make everything sticky. 
This is the first time I've been able to pass on this almost useful bit of info."
Just carbonated soda. It doesn’t matter if it’s diet or regular.
Thanks
The master of Fishermen
TIL! Thanks stranger!
In theory they don’t hurt. But I’ve caught some channel cats that chomped down hard enough to hurt. Not nearly as bad as the spines oh their fins though!
"It’s just a guess, I’ve never been noodling before. I just figure that if the egg was bait, the mentos/coke wouldn’t really be needed, and they’d probably just confuse the fish more than coax it anywhere."
Soap reduces surface tension instead of increasing it though
Not if you have chickens
That is probably a West African lungfish.

"And it cannot contain a  string of three letters that you've used in the past five years, in any order."
"Having to change your password every month, and also the whole 'one special character, upper/lower case and one number', is actually considered unsafe because it leads to people keeping their passwords written down on some note on their desk

The biggest factor in password security is length (together with not using popular words/phrases). This is why proper sites will only indicate a minimum password length, no maximum. If security is actually important they will make you use 2FA anyways"
My dumbass didn’t see the woman in the doorway and thought the dude was giving an invisible audience (us) a meta explanation.
You know that sound your gf makes when she reaches orgasm? No?
Sly Marbo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
How would I know that my partner's key wasn't compromised? Clearly they need to also use a hardware token too to assure safe word integrity via a physical layer as well as a separate signature that assures the hardware key itself wasn't stolen.

"No kidding.

At my work we use 3 different systems that have monthly changing passwords, with length and case requirements.

What's even better is that the dates that we need to change our password on our out of sync by default, so it's not even like we get to develop a useful system of remembering each password.

I manage to remember mine just about, but the rest of my team has sticky notes all over their PCs."

They also didn't force a minimum number of characters for the password. 

Then, when their clients systems were inevitably compromised, they made every password a fifteen character long string of random uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.
