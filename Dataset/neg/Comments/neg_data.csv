I wanna play a video game where I can do this
Me irl and in game....I'm a rogue in game.
I want to play this video game.
"This reminds me of the game ""Evolution of trust"" (which 
everyone on  this planet should play this game once):

"Undertale. Litteraly, its the point of the game to not murder anything at all, just to befriend all of it."

The scary thing is whatever we allow Trump to get away with today will be normal procedure under the next Republican president. W was a terrible president but compared to today he seems almost tame.
Barr's interpretation of the constitution in regards to holding the president accountable seems a ticking time bomb. Even Trump  supporters should see that this line of defense would create an insanely dangerous precedent.
"""Destroys"". I hate this type of ""journalism""."
None of them are above the law. I hate when people in power pull this bull crap. If your are guilty then face it!
"So then, what should we do with rogue unaccountable government agencies like the Department of State and the runaway corrupt NGO's like NED?"
It made it worse.
Fake laws.
His Throws are all really bad because he has small hands
"The leader of a key country in global politics being unbelievably incompetent is boring you? Kindly fuck yourself. If we had a leader we could trust then perhaps we could defer to their judgement to help in the situations you mention. Also, calling the situation in China “tomfoolery” shows your lack of understanding and compassion. I suspect you are a troll."
"Sadly, US politics affect the world. There are those that give fucks and those that dont."
"I suspect there will be one of two outcomes. He leaves his presidency and nothing of consequence will happen to him, or he leaves his presidency and is completely fucked up.

Nothing will happen whilst he is still in office."
"The orange idiot is digging with dynamite. Rock bottom will not stop him, he just keeps blasting through and going lower. The only hope is when he gets to the centre and starts going up again."
What law has he broken?
"Can you cite sources of his comitted crimes? Im trying to compile a list because everytime I talk to someone about this, their reply is always ""he hasn't broken any laws"""
The Senate is broken and is unlikely to be fixable given its design.
"""Liberal judge. Fake laws.""

Then Fox repeats it ad nauseum.

Then the people believe it."
"He literally called the emoluments clause in the constitution ""phony"", he's well past the concept of fake laws by now."
Fake Presidents?
"GOP will force their base to nominate someone like Romney, and the nation will be lulled into complacency after 8 years of democrats. Hell it might even be 4 years."
Unbelievably incompetent yet leading the country to record level stock market highs and lowest unemployment...right
">I suspect there will be one of two outcomes. He leaves his presidency and nothing of consequence will happen to him, or he leaves his presidency and is completely fucked up.

Assuming he doesn't get reelected."
"SS will do it.

God that sounds so weird."
To why would they reverse the decision to not release his taxes? Just confused with the hype and then the turn around? Will it become a national Security issue not to release his taxes because of the issues at hand?
"Yeah, but even if he gets impeached, that doesn't necessarily mean he will get removed from office."
He did lost over a billion at a time when *everyone* was making money. He truly is America's worst businessman.
"[looks at keyboard in soviet]

Comrade, is *that* a typo or also a terrible abbreviation?"
They’re not saying the system doesn’t exist. They’re saying the US doesn’t have that system. And making that change would be extremely difficult.
Seriously.
If you mean the casinos thingy that was a money laundering operation in all likelihood.
I mean yes. And also no. The alternatives there are quite literally asking for genocide against natives so. Yeah.
"United States Secret Service. They don't like being called the SS. But with Trump incharge, I get really uncomfortable whenever someone calls them SS."
I thought he was suggesting such a system didn’t exist. My bad.
.. that’s the point. FPTP is dumb as fuck
"That makes me wonder, does he use his fat fucking sharpie to keep score at golf too?"
"I looked at that assuming that meant he wanted the presidency to become a Trump family business, not that he wanted to be elected again himself, but slide one of his sons in perhaps.

Scary thought either way."
"It would require an amendment to the constitution, which is very unlikely to happen in the next 4 years."
"Maybe Lee Harvey Iswald *was* a time traveller, he just shot the wrong guy"
Seriously who fucking says that

The author was oofed so badly that even i feel it
"I hate that everyone calls a hash a hashtag. It is only a hashtag when it's being used as a hashtag. Otherwise the symbol is a hash or pound sign.

Don't do my boy Hash dirty like this..."
Doesnt hashtag also mean number and pound on the phone.
oog oog social media thing bad
"I mean, they’re basically just the equivalent of subreddits"
"No, you're not the only one. I'm actually a little bit disappointed in Elon for saying that."
"Yes but you see, social media bad"
because misuse of a symbol sucks and creates s bad image/stereotype?
You mean datetime.datetime.now()
">The amount of comments are a representation of your failure.

Me: writes no comments, because fuck the poor sod who has to replace me"
I wouldn't say it's necessarily a failure on your part. Sometimes it's just the language (or library/framework) that causes the code to be confusing without comments no matter how well it's written.
"That's not the conclusion I made from that chapter. There are plenty of valid reasons for writing comments, the book also shows a lot of bad comments that make readibility worse. I think the author made a mistake in calling them failures."
"Pound would get confused with £, so I'd avoid that one."
">creates s bad image/stereotype? 

What?"
"The sequel was much worse, let me tell you"
"Hello fellow {{ data._human._value }}, did you mean search(“SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP”)?"
"You mean

It's not that bad of an idea. If you're going to be stuck waiting for laundry to get done you might as well have a beer
Fuck ya!
Even from behind everyone looks like an alcoholic =(
Don't you need a liquor licenses for this? Aren't liquor licenses expensive?
Dangerous
Folding clothes while drunk seems like a terrible idea.
Looks sad. Like alcoholics meeting.
We got one in Vegas that they record a segment from. Don't know the bar but the bit is called dirty laundry.
Shoutout to Dirty Dungeraees
"""Do you feel sad and alone while going to the laundromat? Fret none! TheWash & Slosh brought *other* sad and alone people to make you company!!"""

I’d be afraid of my laundry being stolen in the time between it finishing drying and signing the check to go get it

Very disturbing
Probably thick as molasses in the bottom
And the award for worst Bobbing for Apples party goes to...
I was about to say this isn't too bad... then i saw the needles.
"That makes me sad, but I guess they are not strewn about."
I like all the comments trying to guess the city when in reality this could be any city because the world has a fucking problem.
Subcutaneous needles for injecting insulin. Still dangerous but not exactly heroin needles. Trashy that they didn’t use a sharps container though.
Holy fuck.....
"I want to say Mosswood park in Oakland ca, but the needles are capped so I would be wrong."
You know it's bad when Satan himself gets aids
me. fuck it.
The grease barrel behind my work In pioneer square I see
I’m curious as to where you’ve seen needles in the city. I don’t doubt it but surprisingly I’ve never seen anything as bad as in the OP even in worse parts of the city.
Fucking MRSA
"> stick proof gloves

Do those exist? Seriously, I need a pair. I don't think they exist."
Meanwhile we use a bottle because the containers cutting thingy broke
Bro ill do it for a mil save yourself a mil
"They are sold as ""needle resistant"" or ""puncture protected"", not needle *proof*, but yes, they do exist. Gardeners for example use them as well, as protection against thorns and spines. You can buy them on Amazon for example, they aren't even that expensive."
That sounds scary.

Fuck I hate Toby
I just really don’t like Andy honestly. He’s moderately annoying to me for the majority of the show and probably the worst part about season 9 as a whole.
Bad bot
:(
Yeah. Probably because he thought Andy was the reason Erin dumped him and then got all mad at him.
"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy."

I like Chinese food :(
Terry ain’t wrong though
They do kinda burn in your mouth in the slightest bit. Like I can’t eat them because I hate that burning banana taste. It’s gross.
Fuck! I hate being white and not having the ability to have perspective on anything...
The fact that people even engage in these tweet exchanges feels kinda sad.
is he the same guy who said Indian food is terrible?
Chinese food from a takeaway is always horrible. Msg gloopy shite
Guy at the bottom looks disgusting
It's probably bland and boring cause he only gets the chow mein or lemon chicken
"And he complained about the food being too bland, so it's not even applicable. It's actually a terrible attempt at an insult. Downright embarrassing."
Its like those people who get angry in the unpopular opinion subreddit.
Heh. Is that a chopstick joke or am I reading it wrong?
let’s go crazy tonight! how about italian??
America in the 21st century sounds like a stupid place.
I never thought people took it any serious at all. After all Europeans conquered everybody else on the planet in search for spices.
"Are you fuckin dumb or what?

Lemon chicken and chow mein are the two boomerest anglocised Chinese dishes you could find. They are bland as fuck."
"Spicy? No

Delicious? Bet your ass"
"Don't forget the posts like: "" i think murder is a bad thing"""
I'm so fucking confused about why you would pick Spain of all places.
"Soooo are you saying u/GearAlpha is black?

Coz if so a lynching is probably a bad idea"
It's just retarded gatekeeping by people that have bland personalities.

Wait does this mean she clocked her manager in the face and his teeth fell out?
That woman is asking the serious questions.
Fuck that film
"I mean, it's just dentures."
One time on a prono KAREN was in you know the self proclaimed boss queen manager bitch!!! (Looser) she was getting fucked so hard she looked at the camera and her fake teeth feel out during the clip! So yeah it was your teeth on this sub. Nobodys fooled dumb ass!
You can be nauseous from something completely unrelated you still don't want them in your mouth as they make it much worse so you try to be discreet about getting them out and then tuck them somewhere. I know one lady who tucks them in her bra. Worst situation I seen with her was when she forgot she wasn't wearing one and they dropped on through her shirt and went skittering across the ground like those old fashioned clattering fake teeth.

What a terrible opener
Tinder brings out the worst in people.
imagine the amount of guys that reference that line in her bio and take into account your really lame opener
"Wow, sick burn my dude..."
Fuck Karen...no that’s an order
Fuck Karen.
"Is this one of those /r/niceguys?  Maybe the woman was sick of shitty pickup lines.   Dude goes in with a tired old line, so she shuts that shit down, and he then responds with petty insults.  Jesus Christ, just move the fuck on!"

"I mean, that's why you're on tinder tho."
"Why are you such a fragile boy OP, pathetic."

She was about to him with the “so let me solve your problems” but homie fucked it up!
"He even went with the ""well you're not attractive anyway!"" line"
karen (and women) bad updoots to the left
Ah but you forget *women bad*

"Yea that response he gave basically acknowledged to her that what she said was right, regardless if it really is. Awful response"
"saying someone looks like a ""Karen"" because of their haircut doesn't mean calling them ugly. Are you dense? He's just roasting her haircut, something people do literally all the time"
Wtf is cactus cock

Idk what “ball don’t lie” means and at this point I’m too afraid to ask
I wish I could watch a raptors game without seeing a drake reaction shot :/
This is why I hate the NBA
Wgaf about drakes reaction? Show me a fucking player
DO NOT let this distract you from the fact Embid at 0 zero points this game.
The ending of this game will be insane
BALL DONT FUCKING LIE
"Seriously, some coach is going to pull his team to the locker rooms and refuse to come out until refs are changed mid-game"
"Ball don't lie.

Refs are blind.

I don't feel bad for this guy."
"Ball lies all the time, but this time the ball said fuck you."
this was just clearly game 8 of the 2019 eastern conference semi-finals.
"I scrolled all the way down to find you. What can you say though, the call was bad."
"That’s our Superfan, Nav Bhatia. He’s not missed a home game in 25 years."
"If that was a foul, then it was on the floor and not in the act of shooting. Not sure what you're smoking, but pass me some!"
That’s even lower cus of stacking probability I think. I might be wrong though
"One of my favourite parts about our guys though, they call it like they see it either way, and admit when they're wrong too."
Meek mill is at the game sitting court side

Yea if im correct its illegal to make CGI advertisement for food
I thought it was fruit punch tbh. Is there something wrong with me?
All this effort to make part of a commercial for incredibly unhealthy mass produced food products is a pathetic waste of human time and ingenuity.

My dad did this to me and told me we were going camping. I believed it until I saw the Disney sign. It was a 16+ hour drive. Man I was stupid
Obviously the parents are the idiots that got lost and forgot the cat
“Bless his heart” means “What a moron” in Southern.
"Hold up, they picked him up after school, then drove 4 hours to Disney. What fucking time they think Mickey Mouse works till?"
Seems like this kid might be particularly fucking stupid.
Poor cat
"KidsAreFuckingConsiderate 

Fuck you if you mock a child for this. They don't enter the world caring about Disney, we mold them."
I feel like that is just a fake plot created for the parent to feel validation from strangers.
Yeah also how he is stupid? They lied to him. I didnt like being lied to as a kid. Just taught me to not trust them.
"Also some kids don’t fully grasp how jokes or sarcasm work.

As a child, and still today, I tend to take people at their word when I’m supposed to get that they’re joking or angry or whatever."
Am I a horrible person?
I'm afraid so
I have bad news for you
"My dad did this whenever he re-homed one of our dogs. He’d tell me it was my responsibility and I had to train them (even though I had no idea how you’d train a dog, and I wanted a cat).

Because theyre stupid? I dont get the way you think
It used to be actual gifs and videos of kids being stupid. Now it’s all parents or adults tweeting about when they were dumb kids or their current dumb kids.
"No, this is meant for this sub. This kid literally thought his house is 4 hours away. That's fucking stupid. But of course it is, he's a kid. He's stupid and doesn't get it. That's the point of this sub. Kids are stupid. And it's cute and funny.

Almost all these posts against google almost always end up with misleading headlines where google was eventually right in their firing. Its so boring and tiring with these rage culture.
Isn’t that illegal?  Every job I’ve had has one of those signs posted somewhere saying employers can’t fire employees who want to organize.
"""Don't be evil"""
"Unions are for all workers, people. It's not a contest for who has it worst."
Fucking NYTimes account wall. Can someone copy-paste the article?
Do you think Google gives a fuck about your union I can promise you they don't.
"Oh boo hoo, the poor office workers and their substandard ""lifestyle""."
"They are lefty and don't want a union. This combination is not uncommon.  Across the spectrum, there's plenty of hypocrisy."
"Let me guess, you actually read the article? Ugh, let me just be outraged in peace."
the number of people in here from chapotraphouse is ridiculous
"Unions are not about how bad your work environment is, or how badly you are paid. Everyone deserves a union because everyone should have self-determination and ownership over their work. 

And it is a decent lifestyle but they are still overworked and exploited. and as someone said, Google doesn't provide those things out of the goodness of their heart, it's designed to keep you working."
"Seriously, that’s just irresponsible parenting!!!"
">anti-place-that-employed-them.

There are a few of these people at every large company. 

No matter where they work, the employer is this evil entity that is forcing them to *do* stuff."
"As someone who has tried to unionize people at a job, this is an outstandingly awful idea. We had to switch venues to meet and organize at least 3 times while trying to get a union consensus because of union busters spying and harassing us (which is absolutely illegal btw). Giving an app just does all the work for them, once they find a little stooge amongst the working folk. There’s always one asshole who thinks sucking up to management is a path to promotion."
That's like the coolest version of workplace werewolf ever.  The union is town as fuck and just slowly finds out who else is town.
If it were compromised that would be really bad.
For a company whos supposed to not be evil. They are starting to seem pretty evil.
"""This is the worst company I've worked for,"" they have been working there for 10+ years, and still be there in another ten."
"I have no information on that. Presumably, either google knows who they are and they've been punished, or Google doesn't know and they haven't been. Either way, there's no evidence that these people leaked anything (and in fact a lot of circumstantial evidence to the contrary).

Punishing people who aren't accused of leaking anything to the public by trying to imply, without proof, that they leaked something, is a bad look."
F-Droid = Google can fuck themselves
"They did get rid of the “don’t be evil” motto, after all"
"1. It's not an EULA
2. ""Don't be evil"" is not a useful ethical guideline"
"In my country, the engineers union is one of the largest unions. I am a member as an insurance, because if any of my employers try to fuck me over like in the article, then the union lawyers will fuck them up if any labor laws were unlawfully broken.

Without unions, employers can just go these kinds of things with impunity, because they know that they will meet no resistance."
"While yes, I agree based on wages and physical need, if you consider the amount of money these companies are pulling down and the disastrous effects their operations have on local cost of living, those people making 400k are still representative of an insane rate of markup on their labor."
"And we never will, guns are dangerous and people are going to kill each other. The alternative is Hong Kong."
"There are other ways beyond forging logs but again, that would be risky as you said and very unlikely."
It's too depressing for me. It's all around me I look to reddit for escapism.

omg r/killthecameraman wtf is that filming
I don't even feel sorry.
Well earned. Darwin is somewhat disappointed.
This is literally the plot of dumb ways to die
"If you think that is infuriating, now imagine the scene immediately after this video where she and her family get an attitude toward the train conductor, start screaming about lawsuits and stuff."
Because people are stupid and think that trains are the same width as the track.  My dad did accident inspections for CSX...that shit was ridiculously common.
She's a complete fucking idiot.
"I mean, according to ethics, we can't cull the idiots, that'd just make it eugenics-adjacent"
Well. It's because theeeese days we childproof everything so the stupid ones die. The Darwin award can't be handed out anymore without being a scandal
It happened because we protect our stupid above all else. Other animals would have let the morons die out long ago.
Thinning out of stupid people is encouraged
"The size of the train makes it appear deceptively slow, but she still packs a punch!"
"To get smarter on average, our brains have had to be so complex that the outcome is a bit random."
It’s what happens when you try to legislate safety instead of just letting evolution take out the dumb ones.
Wtf....what is wrong with ppl...
I went searching for video proof like an idiot and now I'm a sad idiot.
"All of them are standing too close to the track to begin with: Say the train hits a pebble that shoots off and hits a person in the noggin, I mean someone was bound to have a bad time here."
Run a train on Karen? You sick fuck.

"Alright, take your fucking upvote and leave. Three puns in one comment, this is bullshit."

Add to that some people put that camera in their hand and decide to do even dumber shit than they would have done otherwise. For Fame and fake internet points.
That was my exact thought. That poor driver was probably screaming inside his head for these idiots to get out of the way so he doesn't end up accidentally killing one of them.
Conduct her? I hardly know her!
"That train isn't even equipped with one, I'm just being a jackass"
I'm not sure you can run a train on karen unless it's a steam locomotive and you found a way to burn all her awful clothes.

Jokes on you. I'm in the process of writing a algorithm to compile everyone who has purchased that sweater in the past 10 years and has bought a plane ticket to Machu Picchu this years. We will have your name in mere decades
Aguas Caliente is the name of the tourist town  at the base of Machu Picchu.
Machu pichu wasn’t too bad but the town Cusco where I stayed before/after was bad. Altitude sickness forsure
Is the hike dangerous? I've heard about trouble due to rain and people getting robbed hiking up.
"and the town where the train stops is Aguas Calientes maybe?  Btw, did the conductors show off the alpaca fashion the train ride? I had the unfortunate experience of eating 'alpaca' at some buffet in Cusco the night before. I didn't know it was an animal, I thought I was  eating tough beef. On that train ride, that little fashion show made me realize what I'd eaten and I felt a sad nauseous pit in my stomach."
"
>I didn't know it was an animal, I thought I was  eating tough beef. 


Spoiler: beef also comes from an animal"
Unfortunately beef is also an animal
"meaning if I knew it was  llama type animal, I wouldn't have eaten it. Not sure why a llama gets a pass in my hypocritical carnivorous book, but it does. I guess same reason I'd feel bad eating a giraffe or a dog."

That Eyebrow raise made him look evil

Does anyone remember David Bowie in The Labyrinth? They literally had a dude put his hands through David's jacket to do all the crystal juggling. He did it blind and it took them hundreds of takes.
Stupid Question Alert: Would this be easier or harder than juggling 3 balls with 2 hands?
Am I a bad person for hating juggling?
I'm so confused.

"I was thinking about how dangerous this looks, then I remembered it's probably safer than mountain biking."
This reminds me of those vids of people using gym equipment hilariously wrong.
I thought it was weird CrossFit
“And that’s how I fucked up every muscle in my body doing stupid ass CrossFit shit.”
Or for really vicious hardcore porn.
Fucking crossfitters...
I thought my girlfriend is a FUCK’IN BEAST in bed!
"Probably stupid question, but does this help with arm pump?"
WTF is GOING ON
"I mean.... I’m a mountain bike racer. 

I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s weird."
This feels so unnecessary
Goddamn do I hate CrossFit.
Thanks I hate it.
the fuck you doing just ride a bike
Why I am feeling tired by just seeing this
that looks really difficult
Pump fake training.
"What the hell. Just go mountain biking, you fucking idiots"
"Contraption for unusable shoulders by the time you are 40.

I would say this is dangerous."
"As my friend broke his rib riding today... yep... shits dangerous,"
"Careful with that.   


One false move and.... SNAP!!"
You mean Crossfit videos?
Jesus where’s the fucking headphones warning
"Weak, try again."
Careful what you say around here. This is the internet. Not everyone thinks that sounds like a bad time.
That obnoxious yelling and whistling was infuriating.
"Small hill biking =/= mountain biking

Everyone knows that."
"Yep, sorry I should’ve specified. XCO world champ!"
"Look at the mirror reflection it's not ""perfectly"" stabilized"
That sounds very painful
Evil minds plan thots destruction

It’s her smile at the beginning that’s terrifying
"This isn't oddly, it's just terrifying"
This isn't really oddly terrifying i was pretty unsettled before the picture frame or before she turned around.
"Kids are terrifying. Why are little kids so creepy, especially girls?"
This is so cringe im tired of seeing it
Wtf is this?
This isn't oddly terrifying.
Imagine blink-182 playing behind this. Any song. Scary shit.
Oh fuck.
Yup. This is turning into a weird horror media-sub. It's really annoying.
Maybe not so much scary as just creepy?

"I hate Trump, but I agree with this"
"Oh Christ, he actually fucking DID SOMETHING! I'm not being a dick (in line with the one rule of this sub) but damn...good to see something beneficial to all of us."
Finally trump does something nobody hate
"how does this law work for beef, chicken and other meats? there is some hypocricy here"
"Watch the Democrats come out in support of animal cruelty now, fucking children"
Leave it up to hardcore liberals to spin this into a bad thing because Trump did it.
I hope Jimmy Kimmel tries to make a joke about this and fails horribly
"while I would rather kick Donald off a bridge then spend 10 minutes with him, I won't be surprised to sit and watch Democrats figure out a way to freak out over this as if it's the worst thing to ever have happened."
"Trump: ""See? I'm not all bad!"""
... animal torture porn? Well now I'm sad.
I wish every fucking bad thing to the waste of humans beings that do it and the creeps that are into it.
You mean pets?
It’s beyond devastating that they will pass an animal cruelty bill but we can’t get legislation making police brutality a felony.
Wtf I hate animals now
"As a sad fact, that bill didn't pass. It passed the Senate but hasn't had a House vote yet. I assume it will in this Congress, but next time you feel angry and want to call your congressperson please mention S. 488 and HR 3536!

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3536](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3536)"
That's disappointing.
"“Just” bans a horrible practice.

Fuck Moscow Mitch
"Whatever Trump loves, I hate."
Holy God that's awful.  I'm going to hug my animals now.  They think I'm weird when I do this.
"Probably a sad number of people, unfortunately."
It was a thing a few years back. A bunch of it was posted here while Reddit was ramping up that user base.
"and with AG-gag laws, it's a criminal offense as well as civil offense (in Worst Carolina) to record video of animal abuse. the animal abuse part isn't punished as harshly as recording it.

https://www.animallaw.info/article/brief-summary-ag-gag-laws"
"*Unleashes devastating uppercut with the force of a thousands suns, rending soul from body*"
"Holy shit, what the fuck?!"
"Karen leaving her dog in her car doesn't rise to the level of Felony animal abuse, it would likely be a misdemeanor unless the dog was left there with the intent of causing suffering. 

Unfortunately being an inconsiderate idiot isn't a felony."
Did this dumb bitch ever get caught? There is no way I want to research that.
Yes its as horrible as it sounds... dont google it.
It's the most fucked up kink I've ever found. Evil vixens stepping on dogs with their stilettos is a thing.
"Unfortunately it means exactly what you think it means. Don't go down that dark hole, just know that bad things happen and bad people exist."
"Or maybe it's illegal to reveal the horrible conditions, treatment and processing of the farm animals.."
"Wouldn't that make mouse traps illegal ?

Mice are mammals and the traps literally crush their spine."
"Here where I live, we had a guy torture a dog until it was basically a bloody skeleton and all he got was a summons to appear in court."
I wish I never even read this comment section now...It's times like these when I wish there was a hell for these evil fucks to burn for eternity in.
"> But remember this doesnt make it illegal to grind baby chickens because it's part of an industrial process.

maceration is a humane method of euthanasia.  it kills the chickens instantaneously -- they feel no pain.  it looks gruesome, but looks are deceiving."
