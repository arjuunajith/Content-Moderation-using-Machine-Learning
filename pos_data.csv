"This is what happens when games become a service. It's easier and cheaper to maintain a community than it is to produce a sequel -

GTA V, Skyrim and other such games will be dried completely before a new game will be revealed."
"Hey guys, Mr Sony here. I know you all have been wanting to see what new leaps and bounds the PS5 is going to make, so heres PS3's GTA 5"
Haven't really looked into this but is it a free upgrade if you already own it?
Just dont buy it people
"This is quite amazing they managed to launch the exact same game for three different console generations, and people still wanting to buy it"
"Dan Houser left Rockstar,also read somewhere that they said story for GTA6 will be shorter to concentrate on multiplayer. Not good omen for future of this franchise, Gta5 might be the last of the good ones.

Hope i'm proven wrong."
I guess you either die a Lamar/10 or live long enough to become a Stretch/10
"The problem isn't Rockstar. The problem is the customers. Every fucker keeps playing it and buying Shark Cards.

If poeple keep buying Shark Cards, they will keep re-releasing it and introducing shitty DLC.

Vote. With. Your. Wallet."
"Ah shit, here we go again"
I wonder if being on the new consoles is more of a boost to the consoles or GTA. There must be a lot of people still playing it who might not upgrade if the game didn't get ported.
"Last time they released GTA V for free America turned into apocalypse a week later.

We're doomed."
Let me be the first to *console* you guys.
GYAV the new Skyrim...
"I feel like we’ve hit a plateau in the gaming world. Graphics and content in games improved dramatically from the 90s until now, but I feel like games haven’t changed *that much* from the late 00s until now."
"Like, ironically it’s still one of the highest financially performing games on the market right now. So they don’t really care about the minute negativity"
"I recently restarted GTAV on PS4, making this news extra disappointing. I’m in dire need of more  single-player GTA but V has been done to death."
Rockstar: BABABABABA
"yeah. not buying another gtav or skyrim. 


get me some new shit goddammit. i want more pictures of spider-man."
Skyrim on the xbox one literally had no notable improvements. I love skyrim but what a fucking scam. Couldn't just bump up the dog shit framerate to a modern standard?
If you all stop playing it. They will make a new one.
Why would it also be ported to Xbox Series X? Microsoft has already stated that everything playable on Xbox One will run on next gen with enhanced performance
Just don't buy it. They won't keep selling it if you all would just stop buying it.
3 generations of platforms....wtf
Move GTAO to free to play and focus on a story based GTA6. Problem solved on all ends.
"I'm just hoping this will make them open Character transfer again, and give me a reason to download the PC version"
"Ya see this is the problem with consol generations. If you're used to playing games on PC then not being able to play a game you already own just because you updated your hardware is a foriegn idea. They had the right idea with the PS2 and PS3 for at least awhile with the backward compatibility.. Speaking of wich, I'm curiouse about with the new consols. 

So giving it out for free to people on PS5 for example that already own it on PS4 doesn't only make sense, ots something they should have been doing with all games from the start. However when they start time locking things and start charging you to keep playing something you already own, that's when the bullshit parade starts."
I've already bought this game for 3 different consoles. I'm not doing it again.
I'm not buying this shit again
"/r/gaming:

> You know le gem from my childhood? Why will no one release on modern system???? :((

Also /r/gaming:

> Stop porting popular games!!!!11"
If they keep buying the bullshit why would they think someone would ever stop selling it?
"As good of a game as it is, and for as many hours as I've sunk into it, I'm so sick of GTA V."
Re4: 5th time?
Cant wait for it on PS6
We’re gonna see next GTA sometime in 2022-23.
"Look there’s 26 million of us, just don’t buy it"
Stop buying shark cards and it will go away
3 console generation old games.
Shark cards are so expensive and shit how tf do rockstar make so much off it
"If people keep ploughing their money into it then it'll continue. 
Why would Rockstar bother working on a new GTA when GTA V is a crazy cash cow for them?"
Also skyrim
#*skyrim x258*
"Won’t be buying this and won’t be buying GTA 6 (if it is ever released) if it doesn’t have a long solid storyline and huge map like RDR2, don’t bulk it with a stupid multiplayer cash grab."
"All they had to do was announce ONE, JUST ONE large DLC in the style of the last and damned or the ballard of gay Tony and the majority of people would have been fine.
But nope just a port of a 7 year old game...
Although Rockstar are my favourite developers they really let me down this gen."
"Just wait till they announce Skyrim. Its only a matter of time. Could be stand alone, could be a pre order thing with Elder Scrolls VI but itll happen"
"Aw shit, here we go again"
"Both systems are backwards-compatible anyway, why do this?"
If they actually port skyrim onto it i’ll flip my shit like guys please make something new. I think it just proves how new consoles are now no longer HUGE leaps in graphics
"I don't see a problem with this. People complain that they release some games on every console, but that's because they wish to keep those franchises alive and want to give every newcomer the chance to play them without having to buy an older console. Then when the sequel does come out, gamers from all generations will  be informed of the game's legacy."
"Sony rereleases all PlayStation 4 games on the PS5,  packs up all the briefcases full of gold into it's Toyota truck, and relocates to Mexico under the name Sono."
"Gamew have become services that milk you dry while you don't even have fun half the time, grinding is not gameplay."
So they completely skipped a generation (PS4 saw no “new” GTA game)
"Man I used to love video games and get really excited for big releases. When AAA titles used to be the epitome of gaming. Now whenever I see a game branded with Bethesda or EA I roll my eyes and say ""here we go again"" as I play some bullshit pay-me-$20-for-a-cosmetic ""service""  

It seems devs now are just killing the shit out of games via nostalgia with all these remakes, I mean they remade GTA for the third fuckin time now. We don't want another stupid online mission. 

Gaming has become so diluted from what it used to be. Or maybe I'm just getting cynical and older."
"I'm so tired of gta5. It was a good game but definitely one of the weakest in the series. At least remaster 3, vice city, or sa if you want me to rebuy the same game"
As if anyone will pay to play this on the PS5 once more. There will be many new games to play and i hope GTA5 will bite the dust next spring.
The biggest heist was getting you to pay $60 for the same game 3 times
"DONT BUY IT. 

Seriously. Make them complete a new game and stop milking this old cow of a game."
"They'll keep getting away with it as long as people give them money through shark cards/microtransactions and re-releases.

If you care about gaming, don't support these blatant attempts at turning you into a mindless consumer."
"English is not my main language, but shouldn't he have said ""we were"" ?"
"Yeah but, we’re all gonna get it again"
Meanwhile Red Dead Online is rotting without new content for 6 straight months.
This is has been reposted several times ......
Yet we still all get it again
Get used to it
Can we just get gta 5 on switch
"I really don't understand why people are losing it over this. I completely get that it was infuriating to start the show with and I hate how they did it as will.

But the fact that GTA is getting an upgrade is a good thing, the game is insanely popular and have an active community for years. And I trust Rockstar to deliver a significant upgrade, unlike Skyrim where the game played and looked the same across its multiple releases. And it is definitely better than sports games that release a new game every year with barely any changes that they could have easily added to the previous game, and the brainless players will end up buying their MTXs all over again each year"
"god, they really faked us out. as soon as the Rockstar logo flashed I was like “HOLY SHIT THEY’RE COMING OUT GUNS BLAZING” and it was going to be GTA VI or dare I say it Agent since it was PlayStation’s conference. 

I’m not mad that it’s coming to PS5, GTA V’s single player is great and I can’t wait to play it again at (hopefully) 60 FPS since PS5 should have the horsepower. 

I just wish that Rockstar would realize they built their foundation on great single player stories. they basically invented the modern open world game and it’s sad that their focus is on GTA Online, which should in theory be a lot of fun, but is instead riddled with hackers, dying two seconds, laser cannons reigning from the sky, and the worst offender of all, micro transactions. 

I still have hope for Rockstar since Red Dead II’s singleplayer was awesome and arguably better than the first, I just wish they’d get the ball rolling on the next GTA or revive Bully or something. I was a sophomore in high school when GTA V came out and I’m now going on 23 without the next GTA."
A child could have been born in 2013 and be 8 years old and only have one GTA released in their lifetime
I read that in franklin's voice and accent.
"if you think about it, it is pretty mad 

this game has been tossed around for 7 years! it's seen (or will see) 3 releases across generations

it's actually seen the Ps4/Xbox One's entire life!

GTA V wasn't *that* good,"
"Would that be the ""Commuinity"" that is still playing the same game for years anyway?"
Aktually..... it's called the Xbox Series X........ Digital Edition Deluxe Edition. Pre-order now!
Milking til death
I think we can't was.
it's like skyrim all over again
"Haven't played GTA v yet, so I'm hyped as hell!"
What happened to gta vi
It's just not clear. So will GTAV not work as backwards compatible then? Or is this some sort of enhanced ps5 only version?
3 months of it for free isnt really exciting if you already have the game on ps4.
"I'm not excited about GTA 6 anyway, they need to do something really different or forget it. 

I think it would be cool if they had ""new austin"" and ""lemoyne"" and etc from red dead redemption but set in like the late 60s/early 70s. Something like that will get my attention. Just another visit to modern liberty city or even vice city or some shit like that would be so boring."
GTA V for the ps5 and Xbox series x comes with a free skyrim special edition
They at least better add all the stuff from GTA Online to single player.
I'm done with this sort of thing. I have played GTAV to death on Xbox 360 and played it a fair chunk on Xbox One. I will not be playing it again on Series X (If I even get one). Rockstar pls make RDR2 Online content!!!!
"....now presenting, Skyrim: Definitive HD Steelbook Edition"
"Do we even know what improvements the game will have on PS5/Xbox X yet? The frame rate online on ANY current console can border unplayable. The loading times are still shocking. The economy is so bad I would need $1,000,000 a week free before I'd even consider jumping back into that grindfest."
I didn’t even want a new game. A San Andreas or Vice City remaster/remake would suffice.
"Will we get the long ago announced single player DLC?  If so, great!"
I love that xbox's naming is so confusing that the meme got it wrong
Someone made a [compilation](https://youtu.be/Ha39RV0v9dc) of streamers' extreme excitement followed immediately by soul crushing disappointment in finding out the Rockstar reveal was just GTA V again. It's hilarious each time.
"Last time I was this early, Single Player DLC for GTA V had been announced by Rockstar for 2015."
"Ah yes, we was trying."
Can't wait for the ps5 version of skyrim.
You couldn't wait an entire day to repost this?
"Surely they could remaster San Andreas using the GTAV game engine?

No new story, voice acting or game engine*. Seems like an easy few billion dollars to me.  

*might require _some_ rework, but nothing compared to a completely new game"
It was the highest grossing media title of all time within weeks of launch. 7 years later and they're milking this cow half past dry.
"I'm just waiting on crossplay, atleast between consoles if that's ever gonna happen"
A kid who turned 13 when GTA V first came out will be turning 21 (or nearly so) when the PS5 version comes out. Absolutely insane.
"Wait, with Xbox’s smart delivery, I wouldn’t have to rebuy the game."
"Well, on xbox gta will work on backward compatibility, on ps5...."
"Todd Howard should come out and say ""Okay, Rockstar, this is getting a little ridiculous."""
Just dont buy this shit again.
We all know we all gon get it anyway tho
Don’t know what led the community to think anything else from rockstar
"I mean if they are going to add everything in GTA5 DLC, what will GTA6 have? Just new map and plot? Even new DLC vehicles are inspired by modern day ones what kind of vehicle design will GTA6 have different from 5?"
What’s Todd got to do with this?
were*
It wouldn't happend if we not buy this for 2 gens already and didn't spend shit load of Money for online
"I don't see any problems with this. I just played through a game from 2004, and if I only had a console at home I wouldn't mind if those games were available to me.
If the upcoming consoles would be someone's first then I suspect they would be interested in GTA V, it wouldn't be any worse."
I've lost my hopes to see gta6 at this point I won't buy any games rockstar and completely forget they exist until gta6 comes out.
"""16 times the detail """
They are printing money off the online why would they stop. Why make another amazing peice of art and narrative when micro transactions print money. There's are sad times for games.
Personally I enjoyed GTA Online for a good couple of years but would only play in friends only lobbies to avoid the bullshit. But then they introduced public lobby only missions and all the cool shit was for multi millionaires only... yeah I haven't been back in a while.
"We need to boycott it

No one buys it and they'll realise that they need to release a new game if they're going to make any more money from it"
"“Todd you can’t keep rereleasing Skyrim”


Todd: “Say hello to elder scrolls blades”"
It's funny when they put these community relevant soundbites in their trailers.
I don't get how one enjoys memes. They take about 50% of the set up of a joke and just sit on it. It's ironically like dumbing down a joke so the fucking stupid can understand them. Why do so many of you identify with this?
"The good news is though that while maybe 9 years ago or so I'd contest the idea indie games were better and dodged this money-grabbing crap, (they were typically short and ""meh"" in quality; it felt more like people were supporting them out of hope for something better to come) *now* it feels like Indie games have hit a point where they can truly be better than the stuff the main studios make.

Just look at this list, with the bold ones being as large as a AAA open-world title (not to say the non-bolded are bad, they're just other genres):

-Binding of Isaac

-Darkest Dungeon

**-Kenshi**

**-Kingdom Come**

-A Hat in Time

-Lisa: the Painful

-Celeste

-Disco Elysium

**-Stardew Valley**

**-Terraria**

**-My Time At Portia**

Honestly...? These days all the games I play are indie made or Nintendo. It's good to see Nintendo sticking to what they do best and just making games that are fun, but it's nice to see the indie market flourish too. I know the Sims is expected to get competition too for example, cause there's an indie title named Paralives in development."
You could say... it just works
It’d be fine if they added shit to it like new areas or some cool new vehicles or guns but its just the same bullshit. It doesn’t even look different from the other games
"4 times 4 FREAKING TIMES MAN OLD GEN, NEW GEN, PC AND NOW PS5 AND XBOX SERIES X!!!!"
Skyrim Super Serious Special Short Bus edition.
This makes me think that the one x will be supported for seats for the next two years.
They should have released the whole series again in remastered glory. I would shell out for it then
would have been more hype if they release a GTA san andreas remake on the ps5
"Fuck this game. When it first dropped the online missions were rewarding enough to not feel extremely grindy but the quality of the game quickly plummeted right around the time the money hacks were going on. No one wants to come home from work and have to play for multiple hours for the hope of getting a house or car, I dont need to play a videogame to do that lol. 

Grinding is a game killer for me, within reason."
If you buy the title you are part of the problem!!!
Ah the free karma for easy relate able posts that I didn’t make nice
GTA and a few others have now gotten to where profit motive surpasses any artistic vision or desire to tell a story.
San Andreas I thought was pretty bad and the story and dialogic was cringy as hell. I was always laughing at how bad it was. It turned me off the series for so long
"Todd Howard is the Palatine to GTA's Vader...uh
Someone help me complete the metaphor, who's Luke here?"
">The Entire Community

You mean the Reddit community. I got bad news for you. The community for this game outside of Reddit is massive and they will buy it again."
"I will never go back to this game, there is nothing fun about it.

Maybe if they added shit from All Points Bulletin then we could have a fun game on our hands... but as it is now... it’s just a shitty Gary’s mod RP server."
The consumer voted for this with their wallets.
Who do they think they are? Skyrim?
"> Ah shit, here we go again"
5 more year till next gta
Have they confirmed if this is free if you have the Xbox One / PS4 edition? I’ll play if I get it because I have it digitally on Xbox One but not if I have to pay again.
Feel like such a old man (27) but I remember when there games were single player masterpieces and single player dlc existed. I guess who doesn’t enjoy getting spammed killed by jets and paying/grinding for multiplayer dlc.
">GTA V, Skyrim and other such games will be dried completely before a new game will be revealed.

People are still modding Morrowind and Oblivion (According to Nexus, there's currently 14 new Oblivion mods this week and 23 Morrowind ones. That doesn't count updated ones). Skyrim's mod community is a behemoth right now and the game has been out almost 9 years. It ain't drying up anytime soon.

GTA5, on the other hand, is a different story. Hackers are everywhere online (at least on PC), and there hasn't been a single player story expansion ever."
"I get GTA5 has GTA online but how is Skyrim a service?

I just feel like they are trying to buy time as they are making a new one. I would say it's getting pretty insane for both of them as next year it will be a decade since Skyrim came out."
"Skyrim isn't even a service. It's a single-player game that hasn't seen an expansion in 7 years.

The ""service"" part is due to a modding community that doesn't get make any money for Bethesda and when they tried, they got stomped into the ground."
I think GTA V and Skyrim both are kinda the 'perfect state' that a game in the series has reached (not without its flaws of course) but that does not mean innovation cannot continue with sequels. Hate as much as you want on Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed but I think they're at the very least a good example that sometimes its good to reinvent yourself and/or take some risks.
"I was trying to figure out when my mum starting letting me stay at home on my own last night, I figured it out as I knew I had GTA vice city at the time and it was 2002 then I made myself depressed that GTA 3 was just a year prior and San Andreas was two years after vice city.. and I used to think the wait was agony then now it's ridiculous."
"This is exactly why when they release them for free on next gen everyone and everyone is the important part, does not download it or play it on older gens after a while they will be forced to at least start the next one then business as normal"
"Agreed, but Skyrim isn't a GaaS though. Rainbow Six Siege is though"
What do you mean? Rockstar just released one of the greatest games of the decade not even 2 years ago? Yeah they're milking the crap out of GTAV but it's not like there hasn't been any games since.
"I feel like Skyrim ran its course though, even with mods. Sure they released the beyond Skyrim stuff but I’m sure people have played through that by now"
Also incremental improvements in game engines instead of whole new versions. Rolling releases are the future of software methinks.
"Good. It lets them keep a longer production running before releasing, and therefore making a better game."
Rockstar has made a massive video game
isn't there a new ES game in the works?
Talking about sucking them dry....
They could at least give us some new content ffs Bethesda has shitty little mods in the creation club that are too expensive and r* only releases online dlc which every single person I know stopped playing 3 years ago ago. All I’m sayin is if you wanna keep people playing one specific game then make new content for everybody not just your “biggest” player base.
"I’ve got kids, I don’t have time to get good enough for multiplayer, and finding enough uninterrupted time is always going to be an issue too. I enjoyed GTA V *7 years ago* on the PS4, but I wasn’t going to buy it again for the PS4 and definitely won’t for the PS5. 

Give me a decent solo player experience I can dip in and out of and I’ll be using every minute to play I can."
"Unless your portfolio include sports games or Call of Duty, in which case all your live service games get annual full priced releases."
"I actually thought the showcase last week was pretty solid overall, but what the hell were they thinking when opening with GTA5? They must have known people would ridicule them for it."
It’s not about the free upgrade it’s about the fact that this game will stick around for another 5-6 years before we see anything not official about gta6
"[Rockstar, Free?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)"
I seen some people say that GTA Online will be free as a standalone on PS5 but I am not sure how true is that - I am probably gonna buy the game again if they don't give it for free for previous owners only if there's a huge update that changes the Online landscape for the better.. but who am I kidding this is Rockstar ~~they don't put that kind of effort anymore~~.
"Sounds like this will be the case with Xbox Smart Delivery. They used Cyperpunk 2077 as an example, a copy for XB1 will automatically upgrade to Series X enhanced edition once it’s released. Would not be surprised to see certain publishers find a loophole around it."
"Hey, never gotta buy anything if Epic Games keeps releasing games for free lmao"
"Unfortunately, the people buying this shit again and again with the e currency are not the same people on reddit"
We did it boys.
"I bank on it being 13-15 year olds who don’t remember the ‘360’ and there parents are just now letting them buy it. 

Jesus, I just realised, that 13 years olds were born in 2007. Fuck I’m old. And I was born in 2000 but it feels wrong"
Multiplayer just feels cheap...
"That feels short sighted, I know GTA:O is a money maker and possibly RDR:O, but the whole reason they generate so much money and interest is because the install base is so goddamn huge because the single player games are MUST plays. It's easier to get someone to try your crappy online pay2ball service when they and 20 of their friends already own the game.

Not to mention game sales of RDR2 and GTAV were huge money makers without multiplayer. If they came out with reviews like ""Was an amazing, but short 15 hour game! GTA Online 2 announced to launch 4 months from now"" People will be meh compared to on fire like when GTA5 came out."
"Leslie Benzies (Former GTA lead designer producer on the GTA series) announced a game in 2016 called 'Everywhere'. I had high hopes he might the one to carry the original GTA spirit forward.  

 I guess he still might be, but apart from legal fights with Rock Star over royalties, and copyright quibbles I've heard nothing more about his game."
GIVE ME SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGNS OR GIVE ME DEATH
"Last actually good GTA game was San Andreas. We all knows it. They've become *prettier* since then, and that's the only real improvement"
It seems like the vast majority of video games are trending towards being multi-player focused. There’s lots more money in it for the companies.
Rockstar have said literally nothing about GTA 6 so whatever rumor you're trying to spread is really just speculation.
Lamar was the funniest and best character in GTA 5.
Rockstar on that Ryder bullshit.
“Capitalism leads to innovation” my ass
Getting this game ported to the newest console is a no-brainer pretty much it will bring a big number of people to either platform.
I hate and love this comment at the same time.
"GTA V was already released on 360 & Xbox 1. Also my 360 version will not work on my Xbox 1, but GTA 4 will. They are going in 3 generations.

The Xbox 1 is going to sunset without a new GTA or Main Elder Scroll’s being developed for it."
"At least Bethesda has announced ES6...

Rockstar: *crickets*"
the sad thing is IV has an arguably better story but no one cares about it enough for it to get a remaster (or a decent pc version even now)
"At least brad didn’t have to stick through this bs, he died before the shit hit the fan"
It had all the DLC and graphical improvements.
"Improved graphic,  better loading times, change to 64 but so it can utilize more system hardware and all DLC."
I personally only got it for achievements on my PS4... played the game to death already on PC and since the modding scene is limited on console there's nothing to keep people playing it on Sony's hardware.
It looked a lot better tbh if we’re talking about special edition
"Enhanced performance and graphics are up to the game developers. Microsoft is just giving them the option to do it.





Ex: CDPR have stated they’ll release the Cyberpunk on September 17th and than later upgrade it for the Xbox series X.






But I highly doubt Rockstar/Taketwo would do that"
A ported version would still take better advantage of the enhanced hardware than the Xbox One version
Enhanced performance still needs an update to the game. Developers usually put locks on frame rates. And the xsx can't just magically remove coding. It can force a higher res for better antialsing and you'll have a more stable 30fps. But to unlock for 60 code needs to change. A small quick fix from developers. But to enhance a game means basically what pc users have been doing cranking up settings. And settings if we take rdr2 as an example on consoles is meticulously chosen. Options that you dont even have on pc. My guess is rockstar will go in and bump up the settingsake sure everything is stable and release a patch for a 4k 30fps ultra setting or 60fps. But gta 5 on these modern machines should be able to run 60fpa 4k at ultra no problem. Since my 2080 an i7 10700k runs gta 5 at 60+fps at 4k at ultra everything
Oh what is even better is that this sub goes after the wrong games. Skyrim is a baby compared to other games like Street Fighter or Doom or Mortal Kombat.  Not only did you have multiple console ports but you also had arcade ports as well.
"I used to play a lot of Online b4 I stopped and looked at myself ""bro what the hell am I doing repeating a cycle of just grinding mindless just to bust these money into a second on some new overpowered toy?"" and then kinda gave up mentally on the whole thing. If I ever get on the game nowadays its just to drive around in my cars tbh."
I'm from the future and were still playing GTAV on PS12.
Because a lot of people buy them and they don’t have a lot of costs associated with them.
"He's speaking in AAVE(African American Vernacular English), which breaks a lot of conventions of regular english, otherwise you'd be correct."
"Franklin grew up as a gangster in the rip off of South Central LA, so of course he talks urban or whatever the term for that dialect most black gangsters in movies speak."
You have not played a lot of video games have you? The grind actually isn't that bad IF ass holes in public lobies are not trying to destroy your supplies or sales.
"Never going to happen, it couldn't run the current GTAOnline content which is the only incentive there is for Rockstar."
"> unlike Skyrim where the game played and looked the same across its multiple releases 

I dare you to play skyrim on PS3 and then PS4 and record it and try and say that again."
How is this even possible?
I wouldn't be surprised if it's been replaced by GTA online at this point. Rockstar have proven multiple times now that they're more interested in making money from the multiplayer modes.
"Ha this is me, bought it on 360, PC and One. Definitely not buying it again especially since it should be backwards compatible. I wonder who their target market is"
I know that feeling
Maybe a working anti cheat system?
"He showed the world that if he releases Skyrim 500 times people will still buy it, so now Rockstar are following his lead"
Skyrim being released on literally everything
"Internet circle jerk from people who don't actually know video game history and how often games were ported in the far off old days of the 80's and 90's.   Take Doom 1993 when that game was ported at least 10 times is not more.  


Or Street Fighter that has had arcade, console and HD remaster ports of it."
"This. 
Also I now need a mod to use the new online vehicles in story mode, as they removed that option."
"These do still exist to be fair. The Witcher 3 and Spider-Man both fit that description, and those were both hugely successful games"
One of the main reasons I'll get a PS5. Their exclusives are fantastic single player masterpieces.
"GTA Online and RDR2 Online, yes but both single player stories are fantastic, in my opinion"
Dude on the 28th of October every 2 years a new grand theft auto used to come out... that was until they discovered micro transactions.
Even older man here I remember when the full story was released without any held back content for dlc haha
"Yeah, making it big seems to turn a lot of once-great game studios into factories that churn out mediocre DLC."
i remember when single player masterpieces came all included with no dlc to speak of. the fact we are seeing paid dlc in a positive light now is pretty depressing
"So, at 27 you still had a small taste of it but you'll never understand just how bad the market used to be for games. Sure, there were plenty of masterpieces but there were TONS of very awful, very broken games that got released on every platform. 

The Nintendo seal used to be a mild promise the game you were buying wasn't a total dud. PC had shareware clubs that'd send you demos and almost all of it was trash that never really saw true development past the first ""modules"" (I'm looking at you Dungeons of the Unforgiven""). 

The Wii is probably the closest you came to really knowing what it was like back then. The first PlayStation had some of the same, aka those old pizza hut demo disks, etc. 

So yeah, there definitely used to be single release, power developers but the market used to be just absolutely saturated with miserable, awful games that you could neither return nor upgrade."
Same. I played GTA V for the SP on the 360 and haven't touched it since completing it. Online doesn't appeal to me so I don't have much reason to play it again on PS5 especially as my progress won't continue.
"I really enjoyed GTA V online, for like the first 3-5 months. I also really enjoyed RDR 2 online, for like the first 2 weeks"
"They even did it to my boi MK11. Luckily it's the most polished game I've ever played but Konsumables, DLC characters and all that other shit can go to hell."
And all the good single player games with actual updates and dlc are exclusive releases too :/
A lot of games still do.
"It’s not as fun if the shoes on the other foot either. Back in 2014 when I first got the game the introduction race I did online was hacked and I won like 2 billion dollars from that shit. I never could really get into it because I’ve never had a challenge in that game, I let my 6 year old go wild and still have almost a billion"
The Balad of Gay Tony
"Dude I just bought the new Modern Warfare and beat the campaign in a few hours.. 

$44 for a few hours of SOLID gameplay but damn.. it used to take me a year to finish some games on the PS2."
*Cries in Mass Effect*
"I remember when we didn't call them DLCs but expansions, for some games they were sold in a store in a fucking box of it's own, and holy shit how much did they change and/or add."
Fingers crossed for Cyberpunk
"Srsly, lately I’ve ran into quite a few lobbies in games where kids see something they like and ask how much it costs with actual money like wtf. I remember when the $15 DLCs in COD felt over priced especially the season pass for all of them. Feels like a new generation too willing to cough up money sometimes to me."
"I enjoyed GTAV for a while when it first released. Online launch was a nightmare and has almost never been for to me. Watching updates since then, and seeing the community reactions, I feel the game has significantly lost entertainment value.

Single player is still fun though."
"He-hem...

*Expansion Packs"
"We are grown out of the gaming majority where developers aim at. Games are made for kids around the age of 14-16. Our interests are not the same as those younger people. Almost all games nowadays take you by the hand and guide you through the missions  it's all too easy/forgiving. It's the sad truth we are old now.

There are just a few developers who aim at our generation and make great games we enjoy. But it's a small minority and lower budgets because if that, most of the time."
"Been getting back into Quake. The stock game has plenty of replayability, the official expacs are great, and there is TONS of additional community single player content worth playing. You should check it out. The whole Quake franchise is like 25 bucks on Steam."
I remember vividly how the community and industry thought single player DLC was the end of gaming.  I wish we were still in that golden age of X-pack level DLC add ons.
Hopefully they added gang ware fare to single playing this time. It looked like to a bit in the trailer
"Theyre out there. Zelda games for one is still like that. Dark souls is similar. Wither 3 is the same. Pokemon as well. 

Its crazy what you find when you paying attention to media and just browse and look at games."
"Yep. I’m 28 and I miss single player good story campaigns. 

I talk to people who say they go straight to online and don’t even play the story. Seems so weird."
"Red Dead is pretty good, in fairness. Otherwise, yeah."
Apparently this is the focus for the ps5. I've heard they have had so much success with their single player exclusives that they want to leave the multiplayer scene to Xbox and pc and focus on story driven. It could be bs but if true it's enough to get me to switch
"Look up FiveM mod and get on an RP server.

Alot less chaotic."
Piracy is largely responsible for the death of amazing single player games.
Gta5 sucked I'll say it. You used to be able to play GTA single player forever. There were always things to do in the city even after you beat the game. Gta5 had nothing
You know what's scary? When GTA V first came out you were around 20. Now you're talking of yourself as old man and the game is STILL being milked.
I played this game on PC when I was in junior high.  I'm 38 now..it was shown directly overhead and you could steal cars and all that but that's about it.
CoD 1 and 2 are still some of my favorite FPSs. It feels like the genre hasn't progressed since then except in graphics.
"I've been dumping hundreds of hours a year into Skyrim since release, and its all because of the mods. Without them I would have sucked the game dry back in like 2013.

You eventually build a perfect set that diversifies the game to the point you're willing to invest insane time into saves, to achieve specific goals and experience every possible build style."
"> GTA5, on the other hand, is a different story. Hackers are everywhere online (at least on PC)

The way Rockstar regularly destroys mods that make their game more enjoyable while simultaneously failing to deal with mods that make their game literally unplayable is the most infuriating aspect of the whole thing. To me, at least. YMMV."
Yeah just playing the story mode and seeing the records for all the races being 0.00 convinced me not to touch multiplayer
I love Skyrim but Witcher 3 proved that it can be done infinitely better.
"For me AC is dead. I mean wtf is this mmo bullshit doing in these games. You stab someone in the neck and survives but a dude that looks exactly the same gets insta killed because he iss form another part of the map. What is the point in sneaking up to someone to assassinate them but you can't because there are no fucking diamonds on the glove were the blade is hidden inside(that was in Origins, don't know how it's handled in Odyssey)"
"I mean I would be completely happy with just a new map and story, I don’t expect all new graphical innovations"
">Hate as much as you want on Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed but I think they're at the very least a good example that sometimes its good to reinvent yourself and/or take some risks.

Boom. Exactly. And AC is a great series to use as an example. Constantly making new games, with new settings, tweaking gameplay in little ways, tweaking stories to make it more interesting, ect."
"Yeah, lots of good stuff was shown for sure. Ending it with Horizon 2 was awesome (and looks amazing). Plenty of options to open with besides GTA5. Just stupid."
"Reddit’s little bubble doesn’t represent a significant fraction of gamers. That’s why outrage here doesn’t translate to anything, and it’s why people’s ridicule doesn’t really make it past these subreddits. GTA5 is insanely popular and I bet a lot of people are happy about the news given the player numbers that game has."
"GTA online will be free for 3 months only, on PS5.

Not sure if that's for the 1st 3 months after release or it will have to be bought after the 3 months is up.

lol?

https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/gta-online-ps5/


Edit:

GR isn't what it used to be."
As far as I know they said there will be big updates coming to ps5 and pc
I’ve already bought it on Xbox 360 and xb1. Not again..
I waited 7 years and copped GTA5 for free thanks to Epic. Its my first time playing GTA online.
Honeatly theyve saved me 60 dollars for what I know will be a buggy launch with TW Troy.
"Dude I was born in 91 and got really confused when you said about 13-15 years olds but you was born in 2000...

That was only 10 yea—- faaark"
"13 year olds are younger than the 360

Hoo wee"
"I'm in my 30s and I really wish 20 somethings and 30 somethings would stop with the ""I'm old"" nonsense because no, you're not fucking old."
"I don’t have the time to grind a video game 24/7 to buy shit and there’s no way I’d ever spend real money on shit. 

I hate where video games have come."
But at the same time expensive as hell...
it is. Instead of designing a game you just design an environment and let people run around it and shoot each other
"RDR:O has been all but abandoned.  
There's been a severe content drought for about 7 months now.  
It doesn't make nearly as much money as GTA:O, so they don't bother."
He pulled that out of his ass. Rockstar haven't said anything about GTA 6.
"not to mention theyre printing money at this point.

they can invest the same amount of money they have or even more for gta 5 and still make even more money when they release online.

is online development that taxing?"
"Not spreading rumours,Dan Houser is gone (not good as he was a huge part of the satirical sense of humour of GTA) and i did read about a shorter campaign,most likely on Reddit cause i don't do other social media."
I wish Franklin had more missions to flesh out his relationship with Lamar. They kinda got shorted on story compared to Michael and Trevor.
I've always hoped for a dlc involving lamar and focusing on Grove street
"Well, it is an innovation. Not a helpful or positive one for customers, but it does innovate monetization."
Yeah shit just devolves into asshole moves to bleed more quarterly profit out of you with less effort and ultimately less product. And it is aggravating to see that majority of people go along with it an basically seal the shitty deal for all of us by supporting it because they don't give a fuck about anything.
Innovation in the form of new and more effective ways of making money
I've got to say that I'm pretty disappointed in the last seven years of console gaming. I don't know why I would want to buy a new $500 console every few years to play the same games (and don't forget to buy another $500 mid-cycle upgraded version of the console or else people will be killing you in your FPS of choice while you are still waiting for buildings to render). This generation will be the first Xbox and Playstation consoles I do not purchase. A Switch and a PC are just an undeniably better gaming combo at this point.
A fully remastered Morrowind would be dope
I'd put more money on Microsoft doing it themselves for game pass than Bethesda ever doing it.
You are not familiar with Doom are you?
Last month I played GTA IV on Xbox One X via BC and I forgot how much I loved the game.  The driving and the feel of the city was just so much better.  GTA IV has this glow to it that really holds true still to this day.
"Things I miss about GTAIV, the driving. Getting good on a motorcycle took skill. But while the base story was good the missions were so repetitive. There were far too many ""Get to point A in x minutes"" missions."
"The lighting overhaul was fantastic, and don’t forget the addition of mod support which, while didn’t have a massive impact on PS4, was **huge** on Xbox One. 

And Creation Club, despite its flaws, was a significant addition that you cannot ignore"
Exactly. Seeing titles on many platforms is *good*. But then what would the circle jerk run on?
You can literally make more money in 1 hr of doing bogdan
He's still correct. Just because it's a dialect doesn't meant it uses proper grammar.
"Never owned a PlayStation/just turned 18 (my dad wouldn't let me play it prior) So yeah, now I own a Mac, so I still can't play it. My plan is getting a ps5, so a GTA v there in better graphic, is an absolute win for me!"
"I am in the same place. I never owned a platform powerful enough to run it and now that I do, I don't have the time. Played once at a friends house though."
They probably took all the money they were going to spend on making GTA6 and said “let’s spend this money on making more GTA5 multiplayer expansions”
Rockstar on nonexistent RDR2 single player dlc “the multiplayer dlc is sorta like story dlc”
You need to mod to use them in multiplayer too unless you're willing to spend all your money on shark cards.
"Yeah, I did that for AGES, as well as adding a 'prevent despawn' button so I could keep the modded in cars in SP.

In the end, I really wanted to mess around with the bunkers, offices and the yacht etc. So I went online in a private server and hacked myself a few hundred million and a hundred levels. I'd dropped 300 hours on the game and wasn't going to grind all that again to get access to the content, and I sure as well wasn't going to buy shark cards.

Never actually played on a server with other players, since all they do is interfere with me bumping round the map. It also doesn't matter how good you are at the game, a guided missile from a flying bike or an orbital cannon is something you can't do shit about."
There are a lot of sucessful single player games around.
"For sure, just wish rockstar was still on board."
"Agreed. Lots of those on PC, too, mind you... but these days the AAA offerings tend to be PC ports of console games, or at least multi-platform releases where console is a major market.

It's the smaller studios and indie studios that are now making the best PC games. I can't tell you know many hours I've lost to Factorio and Terraria, and now Satisfactory is probably going to steal a thousand more. Minecraft may be owned by Microsoft now, but it didn't start that way, and it's one of the most popular PC games of all time. PC seems to really shine when it comes to sandboxy, creative games."
Bloodborne is one of the best games I think I'll ever play in my life
"To be fair, the games are also much larger and more technical now. Plus, they spent a massive amount of resources building RDR2. Not saying they aren’t milking the cash cow but things have changed."
"I dunno, The Lost & the Damned for GTA4 was like a completely new game. It was genuinely my favourite DLC ever, and one of my favourite games full stop."
"DLC and expansion packs have always been a thing, a great thing: You liked the game, well here's even more game

What's depressing is that lazy greedy devs like EA have dragged the idea of DLC down"
Definitely fair. The gaming industry seems to be motivated by trends. My childhood gaming nostalgia comes from the peak single player experiences and I miss it. I imagine there might be a time in the future where a 27 year old is whining about the lack of battle royale games and wishing season 100 of fortnite was out.
"I am not in the ""Older is always better camp"", but there is way more miserable awful games now, there are way more games in general, I mean asset flips alone is more than every game on the nintendo."
"PC was absolutely brutal in terms of the game even working. I remember when games wouldn't work if you had certain sound cards or other hardware, they would crash to desktop constantly, just proper janky messes that needed community patches up the ass to work. Console games could also be spectacularly bad in terms of quality, but they had basic standards since the 8-bit days where they at least worked. Some PC games straight up wouldn't work on some configurations. Shit, when that Microsoft service for online play on PC got scrapped it effectively bricked some of my games."
">The Nintendo seal used to be a mild promise the game you were buying wasn't a total dud.

*laughs in LJN*"
I bought every item of clothing I could and every high end vehicle just in case they took my billions from me but I didn't get caught in the Moneypocalypse so I kept everything. I've finally whittled it down over the years but I still have millions to blow.
"You can sorta understand why Bethesda pushed so hard to monetise the mods. I’m totally against the idea of it, but it’s understandable. 

Bethesda created a game that you can play basically forever, but they don’t ever see anymore income because of it- you could’ve bought the Complete Edition in 2012 and played it ever since without any more money going to Bethesda. 

It’s like the idea of selling a lightbulb that lasts forever- it’s technical possible to do that, but lightbulb companies would go out of business. Skyrim is the accidental forever lightbulb."
"I wish I could enjoy a game like that, but the themepark-sandbox style of open world game is just so shallow. We *could* do so much better than that now."
"I capped out at around 1000 hours on Skyrim and can't really enjoy it anymore after that. I've pretty much experienced everything the game can offer at this point, the only thing to bring me back would be some kind of complete overhaul mod that's actually fully finished."
"What example? Revealed means nothing. It was just a fly-over of a large region, we don't even know for sure what region it is. I am hoping they come out with a solid teaser this year but I don't expect the game for a couple more years. I won't be buying it until there is a ""complete"" edition, as I do with all Bethesda games."
"Much as I love Witcher 3 I wouldn't say it did ""it"" better than Skyrim; they're fundamentally different games.  Skyrim is a sandbox designed to allow you to be anyone.  Witcher 3 lets you be a specific person.  They share elements certainly but they have fundamentally different goals.  The attitude to the main quest is a big example of this - in Witcher 3 it's a Big Deal, in Skyrim a lot of people forget about it asap.  I do think that Witcher 3 benefited from seeing what worked and what didn't in Skyrim and drew inspiration from that but it never tried to be a 'better' Skyrim."
Skyrim provides something quite different from Witcher 3. The world in Witcher 3 isn't anywhere ear as interactive as in Skyrim. Like you can interact with every NPC and every item in Skyrim. And NPCs themselves can interact with items like if you drop something they can pick it up. It's obviously up to your preferences but having unique NPCs is more fun to me than just having them as background props like in W3.
"Odyssey was infinitely worse than Origins to me, but I really don’t quite know why. The second I saw the announcement that it was an ancient Greek setting, I knew it was just going to be a lazy shit copy and paste job of Origins.

Valhalla does look promising though, it seems like they’re scaling back the stupid RPG levelling to some degree"
"The amount of money GTAO makes says otherwise. It quite possible makes more than any of the other games announced at that conference . The last number I saw was over 500 million in a year and it’s been out since the ps3 generation. 

It sucks for us that don’t care for it but what is 10 minutes in an over hour show that showed a large variety of gaming types that appeal to different niches. It’s easy to ignore"
"Open with Spider-Man instead! Put GTA right after it so that the people who care will be happy and the people who don’t will still be orgasming after the Miles trailer. 

As an Xbox fan looking to dabble in Sony’s wares that’s a pretty damn good lineup."
I'd also say ripping the bandaid off at the start was a better place for it than later in the livestream.
"ew.

i'm sure there are only dozens of us, but i 100% the single player and then turn rockstar games off.

all gaming communities are shit, but the gta community wears their shit like warpaint."
"I was worried about this too. That given the massive success of GTA Online, rockstar would abandon singleplayer or drop their quality to focus on multiplayer. But since RDR2 happened, I don't think we have to worry about that"
The physics are what make it feel so old though. I want modern VC physics. I want modern VC.
"God what a shit article. 

Title: GTA Online will be free for PS5 owners for three months

First Sentence: Rockstar have confirmed to GR that GTA Online will be free for PS5 owners for the first three months 

Second Sentence: GTA Online will be free for PS5 owners who have PlayStation Plus when the game launches on the platform in 2021, for the first three months after launch. 

The article was 250 words long and they spend 20% of it telling me that it's going to be free for 3 months, 3 times."
"I’m still not quite getting how this “free for 3 months” is going to work, do we get a GTAO that ceases to work after 3 months and need unlocking by buying it, or will GTAO become a subscription game altogether."
"Same! Now if any game is on Epic, I just don’t buy it and wait because they’ve pretty much made everything free or reduced the price at some point."
My dad calls kids who he thinks are very young ‘foetuses’ - very true
"I was born in 82... So yea... My first console was an Atari and then the NES.

The internet didn't come until I was a teenager, and it was 2400 baud followed by 14.4 dialup.

There was almost no GPS / maps when I started driving. Had to print directions from MapQuest or actually ask people."
"Exactly. I've had GTA 5 for more than a month since the free epic games thing and I'm still pretty much piss poor after grinding out a ton. And not to mention this is with the criminal enterprise starter pack stuff, can't imagine how long it'd take to get rich from scratch without spending real money."
I personally liked GTA 5 on the initial multiplayer release. The incentive for grinding out cash with your friends was very high since you wanted to have the fastest/best car. It felt really natural.
having high hopes for cyberpunk 2077 is all i have left
"Cheap to produce, expensive to play - maximum profit margins!"
"> i did read about a shorter campaign,most likely on Reddit cause i don't do other social media.

This is 100% speculation."
"Anything you’ve read was a rumor, because nothing has been announced. So yeah, you’re spreading rumors."
"IMO the Michael and Trevor story was more interesting and high-stakes. Franklin and Lamar is just about two people who are trying to get ""out of the ghetto"" so to speak, one grounded in reality and the other who is doomed to failure but thinks he's on the way to wealth."
"I wish Franklin had more missions with Michael. Michael starts off treating him like a naive kid, and develops something closer to respect over time. It's kinda fun to watch that relationship mature as his relationship with his own son matures. 

By contrast, Michael's relationship with Trevor never really seems to move; he's always just trying to manage crazy."
"I heard that Lamar was going to have more participation in the story, in fact,it was planned that you could kill Franklin in the last mission and you would play with Lamar.
But supposedly, the voice actor for Lamar got arrested sometime during the development and they had to change the story."
"Right? I feel like Franklin was only in the game to have a black character as a nod to CJ. There’s nothing remarkable about him and once Michael and Trevor get in the story, he just becomes an accessory."
"Cynical and accurate, I like it"
"I fucking hate rehashed games but if they did remaster it and kinda tweaked the hired merc's, it would be pretty dope.

But honestly, I want a morrowind that let you play Co-Op with your spouse/best friend."
For me the big difference is IV has a more grounded believable story where as V is just capitalism and Hollywood is bad
mods still have an impact on PS4. But Sony put so many hamstring restrictions that is really held back.
At this point Bethesda so much as sneezes and reddit will circle jerk over how they want everyone to die of Covid 19 for 4 years.
If your single player experience was to avoid the main scenario and most other features*
"The multiplayer story was alright, but I burned out on RDRO in like 3 weeks."
this is why i love doom eternal. the single player is sooo good and there is a totally single player dlc coming.
Not that we’re getting updates for RDO either though...
"I'm sure you have a point, but no part of me will ever bring myself to complain about RDR2"
What's annoying is they promised singleplayer DLC shortly after the release of gta v and eventually went back on their word with some bs excuse that current systems couldnt handle it or something.
"Meh, just hop servers a few times and you'll find someone dropping money. A couple of those and you can buy the online vehicles without grinding for months or spending another dime."
"Not really just need to spend a lot of time playing, I got 300h, haven't spent a penny on shark cards and have mostly everything worth getting ofc not everything but you don't really need nor want everything. I don't mind letting other people foot the bill for me to get free dlc"
"Yeah. 
For years online always crashed for me. 
One day it didn't and I got in.. 
And this was my experience, so I left."
"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a single player masterpiece, and Baldurs Gate 3 is arriving soon"
For real. I feel like we're in a golden age of amazing single player games.
"Yeah that ship has sailed. They are a public traded company. The amount of money gta5 online made shareholders is something they will demand now and until the end of time, that's never going away."
Yeah red dead 2 was such a not incredible single player experience.
"Yeah, luckily my laptop can play the indies and I have console for the AAA games.

I've been meaning to play factorio/Satisfactory for a while, but idk which one to get. Any recomendations?"
"My buddy wont stop telling me this. As an xbox kid and a PC adult, I cant do more than hope I get to try it with a port or even a remaster. I'd eventually like to get a PS5 or just get it on my rig to play with him."
^this guy fucks
"I mean, surely the games at the time were pretty large and technical for the era? I remember the change from gta2 to gta3 was just mind blowing. And Vice city to San Andreas was insane aswell. Might be rose tinted glasses for me though."
"gotta agree tbh. gtaiv as a whole was, imo, rockstar's best story to date

edit: best gta story"
"Absolutely. Just think of all the guys my age (mid 30s) begging for HL3 and all the guys a little older than me absolutely bursting at the seems for Baldurs Gate 3. There's plenty in between us that went star eyes for animal crossing. All great games but definitely fueled by the ""man, weren't games when I was 13 AMAZING!"" 

Hard to compete with those teenage crushes on games."
"Yup, asset flip garbage is a real issue for PC gaming. It's part of what comes with a super low barrier to entry. A lot of the one man band asset flip game Devs used to make mods for cool games, either good or bad ones, and that was fine. But then we gave them free game Dev tools, huge libraries of free and crappy assets and open publishing and let them run with it.
Even worse are the actual studios pumping out this kind of garbage.

Having access to proper pro tools doesn't make you a professional, and it doesn't mean your idea or skills are actually very good (sorry aspiring Devs! Keep improving!)

So now we either have huge AAA 'platforms' made not out of a love of games, but to make bulk cash for shareholders by getting players addicted to an endless grind in the hope they'll throw cash at the in-game stores. Or crummy asset flip trash pumped out by the thousands, which have more passion than the big boys, but are usually trend following knock offs with poor execution.

There are still fun, great games out there, but they're drowning under cash grabbing corps and incompetent rubbish"
No there isn't trust me. Nowadays you have the internet to let you know if a game is good or not. The 80s and 90s were filled with garbage buggy messes with a cool box cover. Not to mention that things like bad camera angles and glitches plagued even the good games back then. Granted renting games were common back then but you'd still be out $5 if the game sucked. There were hundreds and hundreds of games that should have never been released.
"Yep I’ve bought almost all the clothes, I’ve bought sold and re bought more cars than I could count, made other characters and bought yachts on them and deleted them when I was bored and I have a little over 700 million still. The only thing I’ve ever played for was lime green paint and after that it’s just messing around"
">  Skyrim is the accidental forever lightbulb.

Not really though? If they released TES6 people would buy it, even if they own a copy of skyrim."
"that's the need that drives innovation though.
the need to bring back customers gives the game companies the drive to create better and better games, until they can just keep the same people suckling off the same title for a decade."
"> a lightbulb that lasts forever- it’s technical possible to do that

For real?"
"My copy is barely recognisable from vanilla, I consider it totally overhauled, but that's because I have over 70 mods running at once. Spent more hours than some people ever play the game getting them to work."
"I get what you mean, but in areas that they're similar Witcher 3 was a lot better. The sidequests in Witcher all felt well developed in terms of individual story. Instead of interesting or unique stories, Skyrim at best would rely on how that sidequest connected to the larger mythology."
"Personally I found that while the Witcher 3 is more polished and has a wayyyy better story, out of the 2 the game that keeps drawing me back to it is Skyrim. Just something about the world building and lore that's more interesting."
"I dont understand why peoole are impressed by the interactivity in skyrim, its almost all entirely pointless unless you add mods to fill the gaps.

Who cares that you can pick up and move any item when they explode across the room every time a new area is loaded? Who cares that NPCs pick up items when nothing actually happens as a result? (AFAIK they never equip them unless they're a follower) Who cares that every NPC has a schedule if that schedule does not provide a single gameplay opportunity?

Skyrim is a great starting point for mods imo, but the base game misses out on far too much for me to praise its interactivity."
I hope they do.
Really? 500 million A YEAR? That's a lot of money for development. Or pina coladas
Lol what do these fools spend their money on....? I played online for a bit and I genuinely don’t get it.
I'm convinced the vast majority of its online userbase are annoying teenagers/kids and as a grumpy old man in my 30s it is not for me.
I’m one of the dozen.
"I'm part of the dozen when it comes to console games. I just don't feel right about having to pay for a membership to play online on console, when I can just play online without a membership on PC. 

All these memberships are getting expensive."
"I used to be the same way. I did the assassin/stock market trick with my single player characters and was more or less done with the game. Then [This video](https://youtu.be/zjaanmZ2ZK0) popped up on my suggested in YouTube and I was hooked. 

This is all I try to do online with a group of friends. It’s fucking bananas so much fun."
I’m still so salty about RDR2 online. It could have been the greatest game ever.
It's probably intentional to game Google search rankings. Modern internet writing is a joke.
So does that mean its going to be free for 3 months or not?
"But you know... Even after days people don't know this and talking bullshit.... I think it wise to repeat it three times that those dumbfucks, who don't really give a shit but starting to complain only because it's cool to complain, understand it."
"Something significant about the 3, Conspiracy confirmed."
So that means we'll have to buy the game again right?
"It's free for people that have Playstation Plus, so if you're already paying for PS+, you'll be able to get GTA V for free on PS5 within a 3 month time period after they release it. They're giving you the full game for free, and that includes online, but in order to play online, you need a PS+ subscription, which will have GTA V available for free for up to 3 months after it gets ported. 

Basically, you get the game for free for buying into the online play service that you'd need to play the game online anyway. It seems like Sony is trying to get everyone to buy PS+, and now here's an incentive to buy it for 2021."
"I think it's a case of people getting wording mixed up cause game journalists are kinda shit.

 To my understanding, they'll be rereleasing the total gta v game again for a price, no details on what that price will be. Later on they'll be releasing a standalone version of GTA online that appears like it's going to be free to play for everyone but require that you have a ps+ subscription and that standalone version or potentially both the rerelease and the standalone version are going to be PlayStation exclusive for 3 months.

Now, this could be partially wrong because the announcement was kind of shit and I haven't watched the PlayStation event so I'm going solely off the one trailer that I saw."
/r/patientgamers welcomes you
"I'm in the same situation. It takes so long to make money in this game. 

Gotta love that 10km long PostOP van cash delivery mission"
its almost impossible now though. Every good money making business attracts opressor griefers like how light attracts moths.
"I think that concept is fairly interesting in and of itself, but I do feel that it would've been better if Franklin and Lamar went through some type of character arc through the story. For example, if Lamar had grown up over the course of the game or got in on some of the heists.

On a side note, you think Lamar would've been a gunman or driver?"
I haven't finished it yet  but isn't that just the story of GTA 4 (the Franklin and Lamar one)?
"That could have been really interesting, the problem is that Franklin's story basically abruptly ends halfway through so they can just focus on Michael and Trevor, and their story was never really resolved. They were even fighting *during* the last heist, and that should have been the time when their relationship was mostly patched up."
"To be fair, 69 missions isn’t a lot of room to fit in character development.

Also 1 thing that really grinds my gears is that GTAV was based on San Andreas/Los Santos BUT lacks the other two major states of San Fierro and Las Venturas that was features in GTA:SA even though they had *SEVEN FUCKING YEARS* to make them. 

Instead, all we got were shitty heists that wasn’t even worth the effort and risk with randos, still shit long loading times, hackers and moddeds, griefers, flying motorbikes that also shoot homing missiles, etc.

Like, fuck, man. Shame on rockstar for being so money grubbing. Not even $1 billion in sales within 3 days and up to $6 billion as of today was enough to get them to make two cities."
Method actors man..
"Every BGS player’s dream is just to get a co-op mode, we got ESO and FO76 instead... good games, just not what we wanted"
For me one thing that struck me when I played GTA IV again was the feel of societal shift between the NPC's in the two games.  You could stand close to people in GTA IV and they don't spaz out and be ready to fight or run in split second.  The biggest shifts for me was the two DLC's The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony.  These two DLC games didn't just be stapled to the game.  The enhanced the story from seeing events in the game through different perspectives and really seeing the city from different angles.
"Yeah that’s why I said it wasn’t a *massive* impact, definitely a *\*cough cough*\* fine addition to my collection"
"Which is ridiculous. Bethesda has had many missteps, so much so I worry for some of their IP... hate on those mistakes! Skyrim was a great game, I'm glad they're keeping it and the spirit of TES alive.

We'll see what the future holds."
"What irritates me is the constant updates to the online stuff in RDR2 caused minor bugs here and there in single player and it gets really annoying. (e.g. crates disappear in certain areas, small items continually found floating in mid air, some animals die just by being targeted, etc...)"
RDRO is only good for designing your ideal western outfit and taking in the sights
"That long? I burned out on RDR's multiplayer a solid year before it was ever seen by a player, because it's just fucking cowboy themed GTAO, which is bullshit and fuckery, top to bottom, on purpose. The day of release, getting to read reports of hacking and greifing, only solidifed that knowledge."
Took me about 3 hours
"It’s too bad because I would easily drop a good chunk of money fo undead nightmare 2, and I’m sure a lot if other people would too. But they make so much more money selling gold bars through micro transactions. Microtransactions are the worst thing to happen to gaming"
"The single player is *okay*. I played through it, and I liked it, but it feels so much less focused and tight than Doom 2016. After a certain point each combat becomes rote."
"Yup, I don't race, don't play with others, don't do heists (seriously Lester shut the fuck up) or any of the other stuff.

I just want to buy and modify neat cars and drive around the map. I'll spend an hour slowly driving along a little dirt track, then helicopter to the yacht, then sail to the city etc. I don't need any more than an actual sandbox to mess around in, so that's what I've made it for myself.

I actually don't play a single online game these days, they're 90% who can click that pixel in the distance fastest shooters, team hero shooters (OW) or ""sandboxes"". I think the only online game I had any fun with in the past ten years was Rocket League because getting good meant actual skill beyond clicking fastest and not being headshot by someone you can't even see, but I stopped playing ages ago.

It's a shame, I love gaming but I'm pretty much only ever playing the odd strategy game, lots of games like Dishonored, Titanfall 2 (the SP) or Forza Horizons. Oh and insane amounts of Minecraft. That's all my PC is used for. Hell I play at least as much on the Switch now (thanks BOTW and Pokémon, neither of which id played before the switch).

I did play Spiderman on my brother's PS4 and adored it, but I'm not buying a whole console for one game. I don't even have a TV!"
And there's a new DLC coming out
"300+ hours into divinity os2 and i've almost finished the game!! the first 150 hours or so i kept restarting and changing my characters and party around, this current playthrough i'm doing lone wolf tactician with a summor/ranger and a 2 handed hammer wielding blood knight, I think i'm about half way through the final act."
Yep! Im 35 and feel this is a great time for games!
"No wonder games usually get shittier when shareholders get involved, nobody wants be held to a higher standard."
People always forget that a lot of the gtao dlcs were originally going to be single player dlc. Take-Two is the reason that never happened.
"Satisfactory is more immediately approachable and is full of eye candy but requires a high-spec gaming machine (that said, I play it on a gaming laptop that's four years old... just  have to turn down he graphics settings a bit). The first person perspective and 3d environment make it very immersive. The fact that resource deposits don't run out on you also make it a bit different from Factorio - you don't have to worry about having to constantly move your mining rigs around while being attacked by aliens. Satisfactory is a more casual game in many ways, but it's also more work because it currently lacks features like cut/copy/paste and blueprints.

Factorio is much more complex (at least once you start fiddling with trains and circuit networks) and you can lose yourself in the details, but in many ways it feels less like work because the building tools (such as blueprints, cut/copy/paste, and construction robots) make it pretty easy to make large-scale changes to your factory. The top-down 2d world is less immersive, and procedurally made instead of hand-made. Factorio is about the factory an only the factory, whereas Satisfactory is just as much about the world.

Also, Satisfactory is less complete at the moment, as Factorio is about to hit 1.0, while Satisfactory still has a long way to go. Satisfactory will probably have some sort of narrative in the end. Factorio does not. Factorio is likely to be a more sandbox experience, though there is a goal of sorts to work towards.

Of the two, Factorio is the one most likely to cause you to reach for a calculator, or a pencil and notepad.

So I guess, decide which of those things appeals to you most. In the end you could always play them both, haha."
">I've been meaning to try **meth/heroin** for a while, but idk which one to get. Any recomendations?

You really can't go wrong with either. Personally I preferred Factorio, but both are worth picking up. 

Just send your friends and family a quick note to say that they shouldn't worry if they don't hear from you for a few weeks."
"I did! I never played the original so I'm looking forward to it. I've played DkS2/3 and Bloodborne :)

Can't wait for Elden Ring, either, although who knows when that'll come out"
I can only imagine the curve is exponential. But that’s my speculation.
"I meannnnn I’m playing through Black Mesa/HL2 again while I’m taking breathers from Alyx lol, and damn if they don’t hold up *extremely* well. But I agree with the nostalgia goggles take, to be sure—NFL Blitz, say, ain’t what it used to be."
"Yeah I was definitely in the hundreds of mods at some points, a lot of which was texture and graphics mods though. My mods increased the games storage space by like 10-20 times the actual game's size due to all the high res textures. I was always quite surprised how tiny the original game was by todays standards, only like 5-15GB.

And yeah sorting and downloading the mods was a whole other thing of it's own, although luckily it's not as bad as Oblivion in that regard."
"I somehow spent hundreds of hours without my items constantly exploding everywhere. NPCs do equip weapons depending on their preferences.
NPCs interacting with the world provides immersion. How does it NOT provide gameplay opportunities? If you're playing as a thief you can pickpocket people. If you hate some NPC you can kill them. If you like some NPC you can try protecting them from dragon or vampire attacks. Having them as cardboard cutouts like in Novigrad is just not fun or interesting. Once the quests end there's no point in walking around that city."
I especially love the ones that are clearly re-written by a thesaurus bot and about half the words are changed to something related but slightly out of place in the current context.
"This, or just click baiting and trying to fill up an article when they know they don't have much. They need a reason for the click."
"Don't think so, why would you say that?"
"Sweet deal then, if that’s how it’s going to work, with the PS5 allegedly running PS4 games, I can retire the 4 and keep it as backup console; cheers for explaining."
"Ah yes, this is most definitely the place for me."
"I don’t think there was anything mentioned about Lamar’s driving ability, but considering he’s able to survive and fight his way out of shootouts, he’d probably be a good gunman. 

I think it would have been cool to see a heist done only by Franklin and his crew (no Michael or Trevor)."
"Lamar is definitely a gunman. He's easy to beat in a race, but he shoots people at the drop of a hat."
"I haven't been able to beat rdr2 on pc cus certain quests just bug out every time and I can't move forward. The last quest with the artist dude where I walk him to the boat while he's disguised as a woman, textures stop loading as soon as I get home to the boat every time and the game freezes. Fucking sucks im like 35 hours into the game and can't progress anymore..."
"Yeah that really is total horseshit - having to put up with my mode being bugged out worse than it was before, for no possible benefit to me, but for lame patches to a lame mode I will never touch again.

Pretty sure this shit happened in GTA5 too, just less noticeable."
It's literally just to buy a fancy gun with gold bars and then do nothing as there's nothing to do and never was.
I had a game breaking glitch during a mission that took 20 minutes to get to it and there was no way to skip or cancel. Their help online consisted of reinstalling (fucking huge game) doing some stuff within the playststion and various other tricks. It took about 3 weeks to resolve and the second I got past it I just couldn't be bothered anymore. Utterly killed it for me.
Same... I still need to get back to it.
"i honestly enjoyed the more fast paced combat in eternal, and i think overall the new mechanics like dashing and resource management gave the game a fresh coat of paint. also the environments in eternal are like 10x better than 2016 imo"
">  but it feels so much less focused and tight than Doom 2016.

This is how I felt. I really wanted to *love* Eternal, but I felt there was just too much to the game."
New divinity DLC is already out
\^ this guy reddits
"But so is the power of the technology they're using to create it

Not that I know the answer either haha, just thinking out loud"
"Yeah, that's really a bold assumption!"
"I figured he could be a decent driver since he was in the same line of work as Franklin and raced him in their first mission together. But man, I wished Rockstar would’ve released more singleplayer heists as DLC at least."
"That's not a main quest so you technically can progress. I'd suggest doing another quest and coming back to it. 

Guarma is where I actually had problems. The one with the soldiers attacking the beach bugged out soooooo bad. So many reloads trying to fix it."
"Oh there's plenty to do, just none of it is fun or rewarding"
"It's hilarious that R\* thought it could apply the hyper capitalism that it mocked and then embraced within GTA:V, to the survivalism of the Wild West."
Pretty much every rockstar game
"He shot his horse in the head on accident, pressed the wrong button and skinned it, before realizing he was standing on train tracks, jumping out of the way before being showered with a fine mist of horse chunks"
"Not op but when I first got to online in RDR2 I only played like 2 of the story missions, got bored, tried to get into bounty hunting but couldn’t find the patience to ride my slow horse around finding gold bars, I also wanted to get into betting but don’t remember why that didn’t work out, then I spent the next hours riding around terrorizing citizens and hunting animals.  It’s probably bc I was a broke low level but I really just found online super boring, I rarely ran into other ppl and the things I did want ( like fishing and bounty hunting) weren’t enough to keep me playing. Story mode however was something I loved. Idk if thinking it’d be like gta is where I went wrong but yea it was not as entertaining as gta for me"
I playing through it right now and I completely agree. I like how combat is a puzzle with each enemy having a critical weakness to focus on. It forces me to experiment and think on my feet. Plus the story is there if you want it. Been reading all the lore and its METAL!
"Eternal has too much story getting in the way. 2016 presented the story on the sidelines perfectly, and being pulled from the action in Hayden's office made you (the player) just as frustrated and upset as the Slayer was, making it almost a perfect pacing moment.

Meanwhile there's dozens of cutscenes in Eternal that *pull you away into third-person view* that crap all over the perfection 2016 had."
The main quest I'm at is the one where i go with the native american guy and everytime we have to run away from the baddies at the end of that quest it bugs out there too. I've tried playing them both a dozen times and the bug out at the same part every fucking time.
Ah so GTAO then.
"What, do you not have a sense of pride and accomplishment?"
"It's not really on par with Witcher 3. Hopefully, cyberpunk and the next elder Scrolls, even the next AC start setting standards but I'd still be greatly surprised if there's rewarding aspects at every turn."
"That's why the most important people that made grand theft autos what they were, anti PC anti capitalism etc etc, have all left the company.


It's just run now by those that sell presentations on potential profits. That's it. GTA 6 will entertain us my guess a month before we get bored.



A huge downgrade from 3, VC, SA , IV and even though I don't like GTA V, I think after the initial shock horrors of the single player missions, even V will be better."
"Bought the game on PC a few months ago for myself and partner.  We loved every moment of the campaign. We finished and wanted to check out online...

We spent the next 5 hours just trying to meet up in the same place but the servers kept crashing, we would get kicked out of missions constantly.  One person would see and be able to use a camp but the other saw nothing.  Hell, I probably spent about an hour combined just getting stuck at the camp fire or stable trying to exit the god damn menus.

Most frustrating online experience ever.  Haven't touched it since."
"I just tried it for the first time last night (thought it was paid, maybe it was at first but it’s free now). Enjoyed making my character and get out into the world and I look at the catalog and laugh. I have $24, and everything is well over $200+ for a fricken jacket. I’m still a noob, but these stranger missions literally only give me like $6 for completing them. I can’t even buy a bow, and if I encounter someone they instantly kill me in 1-2 shots whereas if I try to defend myself my guns do little to no damage (they’re the starter ones). 

Is there an easier way to make money, or do they do it that way so you’re more tempted to spend actual money for in game money?"
"I decided to never even load Online for RDR2 once I heard it was a pay to play sham. I own it on two different platforms nand have finished it on both,  heavily completing objectives on the PC, and have never once loaded online. Saw enough of the online shitshow that GTA V was, and that only took m about 2 hours to quit playing."
Christ... I've punched my horse way too many times pushing the wrong button and I know its a fake horse but I still feel bad.
"You just invoked PTSD that I didn't know I had:

A couple of months ago I was sat at a bus stop waiting for, well, a bus. I noticed a dead squirell on the road roughly 45° to the right of me, about 5 metres away. Before I could even process how sad the though of a squirell getting ran over by a car was - and whilst I was still looking directly at the squirrel - another car sped over its carcass causing its head to pop with a crunching sound, spewing brains and blood all over my white t-shirt and face. That was maybe the worst bus journey of my life, and bus journeys are always terrible."
"I just want to rip and tear demons, not platform my way to the same fight over and over again that gives you every fucking demon at once."
GTAO with less stuff. slower speeds. and premium currency
Wow I didn't know that Witcher 3 had an online multiplayer or the next AC
Havent played RDRO but your experience sounds similar to my time playing GTAO. Glad to know Rockstar learned nothing from that terrible experience
Hunting and fishing helped me when I first started online play.
In the original RDR I accidentally shot my horse probably every time I played it. My brothers still joke about it in any game with a horse.
First night we were playing my SO accidentally shot a dog and I bawled like an idiot.
"I really don't mind the added mechanics but the way they are used is just padding. Like, I liked the climb mechanic, but the coffins you leapt to and from don't really... have a reason to be where they are besides being a route for the Slayer to take. Same for many of the rails you could swing from. Why are they there? Who did that? Some sections work and some just don't make any sense thematically.

Not to mention in the first five minutes no less than 20 new terms are thrown around without clarification. How did the Slayer escape from Hayden's clutches? What are Hell Priests? Why is there a giant floating rock in space above the Earth? Sure, some of these questions get answered toward the end of the game (in a series of motherfucking cutscenes), but it just turned me off right away that the action started expecting me to know this stuff."

This way too long for me to figure out who he was cosplaying as....
Wasn't he regenerating his hands though?
I dont know who he is
"What’s with this carpet? It’s really ugly lol 
Is this a convention center?"
He needs to go with someone cosplaying his roommate.
Oh that is just an awsome cosplay lol

I'm having trouble unpacking that...lol   Why is this at the Guggenheim?
Deadpool growing his legs back
Yes and yes. Can see the Dragon Con logo on the banner one floor down. Also back of a Dragon Con badge clipped to his shirt.
Deadpool whole he was rewgrowing his feet.
He's cosplaying Deadpool.
"No that was in the first one when he cut his hand off to escape from colossus. This is a reference to the second movie after juggernaut ripped him in half. Wait, am I a nerd?"
Deadpool from the second movie when he gets ripped in half and has to regrow the bottom part of his body.
"Ah, there is so much up with that carpet. Look up Dragoncon Marriott carpet and enjoy the rabbit hole."

I never knew ugly laugh was different from normal laugh because my regular laugh is pretty hideous looking to begin with.
What makes him a skeez?
"He has a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, which is a condition that impacts the frontal lobe, which controls speech and a lot of your personality. 

When it first happened, he described how it changed his personality. Most people die from it, but his was exacerbated by heavy drinking while he was making yogi bear 3D. Basically it’s a slow, silent killer that he aggravated to the point where he had seizures, which led to the diagnosis and saved his life. 

He had surgery, and stopped drinking for a few years after it, but staying in movies and tv and starting drinking again made it start bleeding again. 

So basically, he needs to buy a ranch in Montana and relax for the rest of his life - not because he’s a skeez, but because he has a brain defect that’s made worse by partying and stress. 

Also the whole college sexual assault accusation was character assassination https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7342745/amp/T-J-Miller-says-woman-accused-sexual-assault-stalker-college.html"
He's not a bad dude. He literally had seizures that caused brain damage and because of that cant control some things that we can.
TJ Miller isn’t even remotely funny.  Everything he says is cringeworthy.  How the fuck does he even get cast?
I am waalkiinn hereee

This scene alone elevated the movie to a whole new level.
"I think it might be Deadpool, if not detective babylegs"
Its rude to refer to oneself
I’m glad you got your happy ending!
Did I image a more graphic scene?  I swear they showed Ryan Reynolds' actual baby dick but all the versions I've seen since have his shirt covering his region.  This seems like a weird thing to get hung up on but it's just funnier the original way
"I respect your knowledge of the great assortment of movie prop baby legs on Amazon with Free Shipping, but I also have to question what kind of lists you're now for you knowledge of the great assortment of movie prop baby legs on Amazon with Free Shipping."
"Yeah, I'm taking this year off, but the cosplay next year is going to be all out. I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling this way"
"I expect it to be cancelled. But you are right, Dragoncon is best con."
Same. And it truly is the best con!
I thought it was Baby Legs from Rick and Morty ><.
Oh haha lol why didn’t I notice that
Oh I never saw it
"It’s not. Not sure if the person above was joking, but this DragonCon in the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta."
"Ah, thanks"
Ahhhh thank you!!! Fuck that’s good!
Well idk who that is but I'll look them up. Thanks though
"Yes.  Yes you are.  It's okay, we are all nerds down here."
"Oh wait... damn, I need to re-watch both movies"
"Are you there God, it's me Margret..."
"Oh forgot about that, thanks!"
"I have no idea. I ran into him I think It was 2018, snagged a pic, and he had a mini routine and it was just damn hilarious"
"Thanks, haven't seen it so had no idea what this was all about."
Sounds about white
You can see your laugh?
You have never seen other people laugh?
People tell me I laugh like Jimmy Carr. Pretty sure an ugly laugh is still better than the sound of a seal being molested.
"He was supposedly a bully on the set of Silicon Valley, and there's a sexual assault allegation from when he was in college. Oh, he also got drunk on an Amtrak train and called 911 to falsely report that another passenger had a bomb."
https://www.thedailybeast.com/silicon-valley-star-tj-miller-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-and-punching-a-woman
He’s had a drinking problem and the issues that come with it
"Nothing, he has mental health issues and reddit picks when they care."
"That's when my wife left the room. Not because it was TJ Miller, but because that's when it was clear that there was no story in the film at all.."
Which one was 2014? Was that dark side of the moon or was that a different one?
"Same here. I've thought ""he's funny, but something about his eyes tells me I wouldn't want to be alone with him."""
"If you liked that, you'll love the scene in Cloverfield when >!his character died!<."
Having a TBI doesn't excuse shitty behavior. It explains it.
"Before all of this broke, I listened to a podcast where he was being interviewed.  The host kept trying to ask probing questions (in a good way, to cultivate organic discussion) and all Miller could do was brag about working with Spielberg and kept dropping Emoji movie every other  minute.  I began disliking him after hearing that interview and I can't really attribute that to a lack of self-censorship, that's just being a self-serving douchebag."
"People besides you laugh at what he does, probably."
"Because at the end of the movie he modifies Cable's time travel device to go wherever he wants in time. Notable changes to the time line:

1. He kills Ryan Reynolds before accepting X-Men Origins: Wolverine role. 

2. He saves his love interest. 

3. He saves Sugarbear.

Edit: Kills Reynolds before accepting Green Lantern* 

(But he does execute ""Deadpool"" before Hugh Jackman gets the chance in Origins.)"
I’ve heard some theaters screen alternate scenes as some kind of test for the studio. Or it could be a director’s cut clip.
Marsh-mellow effect.
"I watched it again a few weeks ago. They briefly show Ryan doing a ""indecent exposure"" parody where you can see his baby dick for half a second."
At this point I'm not even surprised there is a great assortment with free shipping.  It did briefly take my mind off the fact the whole Donald Trump thing is real.
Did you accidentally a word?
"They can’t cancel it, they would lose contracts and a shit ton of money."
Same!! I’ve been going for a while now and always get Marriott. Last October was the first time that I missed the ball and I was so upset. But now I’m not even going if it even still happens and I’m so relieved I didn’t get a hotel room lol
Fuck me I thought it was a Happy! reference
Yes—Interdimensional Cable was my first thought after *this dude is waving a (fake but still wtf) handgun around at the mall*
Shirt-dickin' it.
OK thanks.  Really looks like the Guggenheim
Look up deadpool baby legs on YouTube
We watched them back-to-back a couple weeks ago. There were so many subtle jokes from the first one that were carried over that we missed the first time around  it made the second one way more enjoyable.
"*No wonder your president has to be an actor. He's gotta look good on television.*

I'm having an affair with my laugh.
[deleted]
"Wow! Kinda seems like Eric Bachman was written around him, if it is actually true"
"So from what I've read the sexual harassment accusation was from a problematic and resentful girl upset that he picked his wife over her. It's been a couple years since I read about it but her credibility seemed very suspect (compared to the usual), so please excuse any mistakes here. At the very least it's a massive gray zone, and it never went anywhere. I work with sexual abuse victims on the psych ward and this shit makes me mad, so I'm not just defending him because I like him. 

Also, he later had a brain tumor removed from his frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for managing behavior, and he's missing a chunk of brain mass there. Go figure he acts out? He has brain damage. I believe he needs some leniency for some of his nonsense. Somehow he's managed to be successful anyway. 

Fwiw my ex served him at a restaurant in Charleston and he was the nicest customer she ever had. Tipped like crazy, paid for the table of 8, wife was wonderful. Asked her if she wanted to see a magic trick and double fisted champagne bottles. Took pictures together and got the both of us tickets to his stand up. 

I'm just saying he's not your typical case. You're missing a lot of context."
"I thought he was good on the show but then I watched his standup and stopped liking him

it wasn't actively bad or anything, it just wasn't too good"
"From what I remember, the college allegation sorta fell apart, but the rest of the stuff is enough tbh"
I was wondering why his character was essentially removed from the show.  It went downhill pretty quickly after he left.
"to be fair, it kinda sounds like he is a real life version of his SV character"
en vino veritas
"I mean, he's been accused of sexual misconduct, Silicon Valley cast members have said that he was really hard to work with due to him being very entitled and rude. He also drunkenly called in a false bomb threat on a woman on an Amtrak train that he was apparently having ""hostile exchanges"" with."
Mental health issues can explain shitty behavior but it doesn't excuse it.
"You expected a story in a Michael Bay movie about shapeshifting giant robots from outer space, some of which are dinosaurs?"
"Smart of her. Saved precious moments of her life not watching that hodgepodge of a movie. If only I'd done the same. So many insufferable characters, the freaking daughter, ugh."
It was the first movie of the Wahlberg series
"If you liked that, you'll love the scene in Underwater when >!his character died!<."
Having paraplegia doesn't excuse poor lap times. It explains it.
why-not-both.gif
Was it a Radiolab episode? That sounds familiar.
"OH MY GOD THANK YOU
Sugarbear is okay again, that's good, that's what matters"
"The end credits sequence where he travels in time
https://youtu.be/lDrCCef6n-U"
I thought it was the green lantern role he was preventing?
There have been three different versions released on home media.
But pandemic? It's totally over with right?
They can cancel it. It would be expense but responsible. Money... Human life... Money... Human life....
I thought it was a Being John Malkovich reference.
This isn't a far off guess though
It looks like a convention. Usually everyone at those has to go through security and all fake weapons are marked
"Not a mall, looks like a convention center"
It’s at Dragon Con in Atlanta. Lots of people with prop weapons there. He’s technically still breaking the rules though as you aren’t suppose to brandish your prop weapons on the convention floor like that.

I believe it is dociliniation
*cockin' it
"Portman is known for his concrete work and great atriums.  Not as well known as Frank Lloyd Wright who did the Guggenheim but certainly well known for his work, especially in Atlanta.  The road next to the Marriot is John Portman drive as he designed the entire area, Marriot, Hyatt, Hilton, America's Mart, Peachtree Center and the Peachtree Plaza."
"good old doc, ""great scot!"""
Where was this stated?
"""Hello? Erlich Bachman? This is Mike Hunt. Is your refrigerator running?"""
"I had a buddy who needed brain surgery. 
He had a beautiful, loving, wife. 3 kids.  A good career. 
As soon as he recovered from them taking a chunk of brain out, he divorces his wife that tended to him through his recovery, quits his job. moves across the country temporarily to be with some girl he met on instagram. then moves back, then gets married to a different girl, then gets divorced, then gets married to a different girl.... he's all over the place. I haven't spoken with him in a few years because he's just a whirlwind of constant change and unpredictability.    
  
So yeah, I see what you're saying."
"TJ Miller is hilarious and in the link he obviously loves his wife. He’s definitely not following society’s norms. 

[TJ Miller shirtless with a battle axe story ](https://youtu.be/Fv6bQxEdRag)"
Okay but I have my own story about him where he was one of the worst customers I’ve dealt with. Just very rude and belligerent.
Which one?  There is one special where he is clearly inebriated and having a bad set. It's the one where he pours water all over himself.
"Ah yes, the ol’ accused = guilty rational. Even funnier considering that girl was found to be full of it."
"As someone with mental health issues, I fully support this statement."
My depression doesn’t give me a free pass to make someone else feel shitty.
"Why doesn’t it excuse it? Shouldn’t mental health issues be treated the same way other issues are in terms of excusing the negative and uncontrollable, aspects of the persons disease?"
"Who said YOU had to excuse anything? You shouldn’t judge in the first place, asshole."
"If you go into a transformsrs movie, you're gonna havs a bad time.

Unless you're just in it to see ol' toe thumbs work her magic."
Fuck I’m getting old and losing track of the years already. When he said “Transformers (2014)” I legitimately thought he meant the original Shia LaBeouf one.
Stealing this. THANK YOU
Except lap times don’t affect anyone and aren’t important. But if you’re being an asshole to people it’s not their responsibility to be gracious and understanding just because you have a medical condition. No one gives a shit.
Dude called in a bomb threat. Let's not be cute about why brain disorders aren't like missing limbs.
I think it was Nerdist but I'm sure he did a bunch of promotional stuff and probably behaved the same way.
It's all that matters. I will cry if he isn't in Deadpool 3.
How come I had missed this all this time? Thank you for the link.
"You're right! He also straight executes the ""Deadpool"" from Origins."
"It’s all based on our Looney Tunes Governor Kemp here in GA. The way I understand it, as long as he keeps the state open, DragonCon will have to happen less they lose tons of money by breaking contracts. The only way it gets canceled is if Georgia reaches a certain threat level that allows things to close down without breach of contracts"
"I thought it was a reference to a really bad trip I had in the 80's, but no-one alive still knows about that"
"It’s strange though. Usually you see a bunch of other people in cosplay at a convention, but although he is surrounded by a bunch of people, I don’t see a single other cosplay."
"Dragon con in Atlanta has like zero security. Literally just thousands of people in costumes walking around on the street, through hotels, in the mall... you pretty much just walk around until you don't see anybody in costume, and that's how you know to turn around and go back the other way."
"That is the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta during Dragon Con which is a convention hotel, so close enough."
"Ah OK, thanks. I thought dude in the background was an Apple Store employee but yeah…no"
"You shouldn’t point your weapon at anyone, even an airsoft pistol can do irreparable eye damage"
"It doesn’t say exactly that he was hitting on her, but had been involved in [hostile exchanges with a woman who was sitting in a different row from him in the first class car.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/entertainment/tj-miller-arrest/index.html)"
Sounds like we're saying he's a human with good days and bad days. Maybe a few really bad days.
"Giiiirrrllll..

We need the deets"
"Was he drunk, and that's why it wasn't funny? That kind of makes sense, because the jokes were okay but his comedic timing was all sorts of off."
"Found how, and where?"
"Mental health issues don't excuse behavior

He does need help but that doesn't give him a free pass"
"Id argue that there are very few truly ""terrible"" human beings, and those tend to have severe mental issues such as sociopathy.

 It pretty much all boils down to bad upbringing, socioeconomic circumstances, lack of education and trauma.

So yes, he clearly has some mental issues - doesn't mean he gets a free pass to act like a dick."
"lmao nobody is ever responsible for doing terrible shit, it’s their mental issues!"
"As someone affected by an alcoholic bipolar father, I agree as well."
"Hey, me too! Mental health high five!

And happy cake day!"
"In terms of other diseases, when something is wrong, that person gets treatment to fix the issue. You don't ignore symptoms of a disease, they help you diagnose the real problem and help fix it. If a person is able to claim they're mentally ill and provide that as a reason they committed a crime, they go into treatment. Theres a difference between recognizing a problem and doing what you can to solve it, versus shrugging it off and going ""well, I'm just like this so get over it"". Treatment is hard and scary but it can be life changing for those who need it."
Why?
People who don’t give a shit about mental illness caused by brain injury are assholes.
"I understand the sentiment, but like, when you have brain damage you literally don't have the capacity to act certain ways because the part that is responsible for it is destroyed. No amount of can-do attitude can really change that."
"You're right, brain disorders only cause people to lose control of their thoughts and actions, how silly of him"
"Come on Disney, man up and start working on Deadpool 3!"
"Even if it is for one frame, all that matters!"
He should get his own movie.
"Thanks for clarifying. Hilarious, need to watch again"
"additional tidbit if you're not aware but that was also Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in that movie, which might be why you got confused."
"They’re all dressed like NPCs. 


(And I think I see a couple less recognizable characters in the background)"
"Let's see we have heavier set dudes wearing black shirts, the classic pillar sitter, and some person in the background possibly in a bloody lab coat thing? A crazy hat on a guy on the right side. Definitely a convention. Looks way too light to be dragon con though so it's either on the very last day with no more scheduled events or it's Momo con which uses the same Marriott hotel and is a much smaller event."
"His earlier stuff when he was an an up and comer was much better than that special. He was clearly drunk in that special. He's certainly capable of being funny, or at least was at one time."
"Well sounds like it’s two unverified stories against each other, right?"
"No I agree, but saying you don’t excuse it is pretty much the same as saying you’re blaming them for it. For something that is out of their control. You don’t blame the boy who gets a sinus infection (illness) and starts crying (symptom) or the old man with Alzheimer’s (Illness) who wonders off from home (symptom). You understand that their actions are consequences of the disease, and you shouldn’t pass judgment upon them for it. I’m not trying to argue it should be shrugged off, just that the symptoms that go along with mental illnesses should be seen as the same as symptoms that arise from any other illness. Maybe I just miss understood how that phrase was meant originally."
"I will answer actually. 

Try to say to the people that say that mental illness explains shitty behavior that the illness itself has causes and that it’s not just a guy with no value or a broken genome, but that he’s probably trying to deal with his own issues. And then see those people that present things so they look good when saying that it explains but doesn’t excuse *shit on the guy* and try to make you say that he’s not human, that he’s not like them, that... Wait, those guys actually said that it explained? Then why don’t they understand shit? Oh, yeah, they just like to point fingers at someone. Nobody asked them to be behind the judge when the sentence is given, so why are they spitting on that guy ever since? Noisy fucks...

Oh, also. I know I’ll be said that ""I defend a sexist terrorist!!! Yeah, I’d rather defend him than the guy who doesn’t understand any word that I write but then quote Voltaire in another thread. Sure buddy, you are a freedom fighter... /s"
Let's not pretend that people with brain disorders can't also just be assholes.  It's not like every thought and action is completely at the whim of a disorder here.
Isn't it majorly delayed due to problems with the stunt crew in the last movie?
"So they're all playing Ryan Reynolds characters, cool!"
"Yeah that's definitely different than what I was trying to say, but I'm glad you explained it out a bit! I'll use myself as an example. I have PTSD due to childhood trauma. This has caused me to lash out to my friends and family on multiple occasions, and has also caused me to treat people poorly based on how PTSD rewired my brain at an early age. I still take full responsibility for my actions and apologize to those I've hurt, while actively doing what I can to prevent that again in the future. That being the case, different illnesses are treated differently, but there still has to be some level of accountability if someone hurts another person. I never specifically ""judged"" anyone, but I am saying that people still hold some level of responsibility for the actions that they take, regardless of what may have impacted them to do so."
But let's just assume none of them are. That's way better.
Oh I didn’t read about that and had assumed it was because Deadpool is edgy content and Disney tries to do family friendly material.
"So in your scenario, you are able to realize that your lashing out is a product of a mental health illness and take responsibility for it. How do you think those that are the target of the lashing out ( your friends and family) internalize those instances. Do they hold you accountable (as you do yourself) or do they excuse the behavior and understand it is a symptom of a mental health issue they know you have?


Edit: I realize after writing that those two options aren’t mutually exclusive. I’m not trying to be argumentative, just trying to get a grasp on how people in general react to mental illness issues. One of the best things I think my school has taught in its preclinical years is the importance of treating medial illness and they symptoms associated  the same you would a patient with any other condition. I fully believe by addressing this head on there has been a lot of biases, in my classmates and myself, that have been erased."

your stove is gay!

This is probably the coolest thing i’ll never get to see with my own two eyes. Atleast you let me see it through the lens of yours so i appreciate the share! Such an awesome coincidence... Does it happen consistently due to the knobs positioning?

What bout algae?
You need some plants /r/plantedtank
It's not like fish never see direct sunlight. From seeing this refraction you can realize that all the light isn't absorbed by the water.
"It takes a lot of sun for a long time to heat up the space of a fish tank. Maybe a fish bowl I’d be worried but a tank for 10 minutes or when the door is open? Windows aren’t going to cause it to have a magnifying glass effect, that requires curved class. There is nothing to worry about. I’m more worried about how many people don’t know you can’t put tap water into a fish tank without letting it sit for a couple of hours or a day."
"Weak. Thank you Apollo for saving me from another rick roll. 

It’s 2020 pleaaaaaase find a new thing."
I don't think it's about the temperature. Fish tank when exposed to sunlight on a regular basis causes uncontrollable algae blooms. Thus it is highly advisable to keep your tank away from direct sunlight.

Some company should put out retro style hi def tvs with knobs and dials and big ass speakers. Sound bars suck
Usually old TV is new TV bench. With the occasional wildcard being a geriatric stereo system that hadn't been used since grandpa had died so no more polka on Saturdays.
The bottom tv will probably be worth more than the top one in a decade or two.

Total old school carpeting and paneling.  Auntie's keeping it real.
"They really built those old wooden TV frames very well. If you pulled out the picture tube, and electronics and then put in some shelves, you'd have a nice piece of functional furniture."
Make the old TV into an aquarium
"Anyone old enough to remember the 80's knows this very well. The early 80's TV'S were so heavy and cumbersome, that as TV's got more compact, it was easier to just put the new one on top instead of trying to lug the old monstrosity to the trash. Not to mention a lot of places make it illegal to put old tube TV's in the regular trash. You either have to pay simeone to come get it, haul it to a special recycler yourself."
We got the same setup in my living room
My family did the same thing back in the day.
 The future is now old man.
Yooooou might be a redneck...
"This was pretty common when I was growing up.  Older folks had those TV's that doubled as furniture and were extremely heavy. When it finally came time to get a new one, TVs no longer came with wood enclosures so they needed something to sit on. Since most old folks didn't know anyone younger to lift the old tv and haul it away the old tv would act as the new TV's stand."
I follow r/crtgaming and thought I was in that sub for a minute
She's a great Aunt.
"Back when I worked at a TV repair shop people would say they had a ""floor model"" TV because ""it sits on the floor"""

Something something standing on the shoulders of giants.
Everyone did this in the 90s
major flex honestly
Growing up in the 80's we did that.  Just draped a sheet over the old one and know one is the wiser.
Hook a Raspberry Pi to the old one that just scrolls the TV Guide channel for her.  So she can know which channel to tune to on her newer TV.

This is the punchline of a Jeff Foxworthy joke....
"“If your new TV sits on your old TV, you might be a redneck”"
That old American house style always looks so depressing unless it's Christmas time.
ahhhhh yes. Back when TVs weren't just some soulless appliance. They had craftsmanship! They where art! A piece of furniture that all the other furniture would be pointed at.
Dual screens for better productivity when working from home

that’s pretty cool actually
"Upgrades, people upgrades."
"The setup of the TV in the corner together with the brick fireplace to the right, the faux wooden panels behind, and the window to the left really reminds me of our family room in the house where I grew up.  Even the placing of the heating duct is accurate. All that would really be needed to recreate it from 1990 is the TV on top of a cabinet from Ethan Allen with a 4-head VCR and filled with old VCR tapes, the carpet a shade of tan / off-white, and a busted cuckoo clock on the wall behind the TV."
Pretty  funny
I wanna see your great-aunt balancing her new TV in 10 years from now on today's new TV. That's what I want to see
I’m a little surprised there isn’t a Afghan or a Doily draped over it to hide the old screen.

"Aww, this reminds me of my grandmother, who passed a few years ago. She grew up in the Great Depression and recycled everything - wrapping paper, aluminum foil, you name it. Anyway, she would NEVER consider buying a piece of furniture to sit her new flat screen on, especially when she had the big old box tv sitting there. Took years to get her to get rid of it and mount the flat screen."

"This is an *incredibly* common sight in middle America. My parents have an old tube TV with an old plasma TV on top with a new OLED TV in front of the plasma, all because there is no way for them to easily throw away a television. (The trash service won't pick up something that big, and they're not paying for a waste removal company to come and take it away).

My guess is that they're either going to leave it in the house or in the front yard if they ever buy a new place..."
"Hey, she spent money on it why not use it? It looks pretty dope like that anyway."
"WOW that old TV takes me back!!  

Remember when VHF and UHF channels had separate dials??

When I was a kid we had two of those giant TV's stacked on top of each other.  The top one had picture but no sound; the bottom one had sound but no picture.  (Yeah, we were poor, both were roadside finds.)  It was kind of fun though; me and my sis would set the watching TV to a sitcom and the listening TV to a cartoon and laugh our asses off.

I have a 1981 Sony trinitron wood-paneled console tv. Only accepts RF but it is a beautiful piece.

It doesn't hold any really fancy china or anything, and they store files and other random junk in the bottom cabinet drawers.  It takes up a TON of room in that room, and could very easily be replaced by something slimmer and more modern, but they insist on keeping it.

Anyway, for the longest time, they've had an old CRT television sitting in that fucker, until they finally realized what HD was and decided to get a new TV to put in it.  Except they didn't take out the old one, they just put a new, small flatscreen on the shelf *above* the CRT, so now they have two working TVs in that room, and my dad will sometimes watch both at the same time so he doesn't have to flip back and forth between baseball and hockey."

"When you sit there and watch a film, technically you’re watching a film on a broken TV."
This was normal back in the days before time. I remember my aunt had one TV that had a picture on top of another TV that only had sound so she'd use them both.
We did this in my house until about 1999. Except they were both those massive clunky TVs.

"We had a big tv just like that one. The picture went out but the sound still worked. We also had a smaller box tv that we had on top that had good picture but the sound was all messed up. We would have to have both on the same channel so we could watch tv, most times it was out of sync a millisecond, not to much to be a real problem but just enough to be annoying. We had this set up for about a year, then one of my uncles got “a good job” and got my grandma a new tv. I was supper happy to finally play my Super Nintendo on a new tv with good color. Good times."
Parents did the same when I was a kid but ours was a huge 27” tube tv
That's the new '*Picture-on-Picture*' trend.
Love this. You can always tell when you're in an elderly person home because the TV is still in the corner of the room not the central focal point. Back in the day when TV was an accessories to daily life not the centre of it
Don't talk to me or my son ever again!

This is meme material
I remember when I was the remote.
All I can see was dual television.
"Top one for ps4, bottom one for Super Nintendo.  Auntie has all of her bases covered."
"This was my childhood. One for sound,  one for picture. Since I was the youngest I was the remote and antenna."
That’s called upcycling!

Did you pour water down the back of it?
"I had an uncle in the Caribbean who had two old tvs stacked like this, one for the picture, one for the sound."

How else is she gunna be able to gamble on the ponies and bet the over on the Chiefs and sweat them both when the NFL returns? Who doesn’t love a degen family member.
The bottom TV was our TV to play NES while pap watched a tube TV sitting on top. We had to sit on the floor of course.
A piece of technology standing on the shoulders of the ancient giant.
It’s a beautiful metaphor really
It stands on the shoulders of giants.
"My grandpa has had an ever evolving version of this for decades. Huge sports buff. For my childhood it was a big console tv, with a smaller but still big CRT on top. End table next to that stack with a third decent size CRT and a 4th small one on it. All working, all on, all different channels. As one failed, he’d stack another, for a few years it got pretty precarious with two stacked on this wooden shelf thing that was very obviously stressed. Once had a newer crt in the frame of an older broken console. iIt was and is a forever cycling thing. It’s different every time I visit. He’s more “with the times” these days, last I saw he had 3 of the truly huge like 65”+ flat screens and a 4th smaller but still very large flat screen. Literally the entire wall is tv now lol. He’s getting “up there” in age now (96 now I think?) so he just does whatever the hell he wants lol. Bless him. Was in the battle of the bulge in wwii and reported directly to general Patton as I understand it."
This is how a new TV asserts dominance
"Of course, you always have to keep a CRT TV handy in case you want to play Super Nintendo!"
Those Golden Girls episodes are gonna look great.
so old tv
I'm pretty sure this was a Jeff Foxworthy joke. Your great-aunt might be a redneck.

"Been listening to a lot of Dusty Slay lately and one of his skits is how people in trailer parks invented a lot of things, like using an old TV as a TV stand.

Obviously you've never had a great aunt before
"And then she answers « yes, the spirits can better communicate through the old ones » and then you can’t sleep until you die"
She paid good money for that TV and the picture still good.
you can almost see the older tv sigh.
Why does this make me so happy?
That’s what we did in the 90s.
"I had a similar setup in my room as a child, except the top TV was one from the 90's instead. I would game on the bottom and watch shows on the top."
I like it.
My mom does this
I would turn the old one into an aquarium or terrarium
"My question is, does the above TV have another evolution? If so, what does it look like??"
I want to play pong on that bottom TV
We all have a family member that does this. Heck I have 2!
Cant believe we used to stare at the ground to watch TV
I had one of these TVs gutted out and plexi glass put in the front. Made for a great snake cage.
She might be a redneck
The wind is gonna blow that right over....
"As a good niece/nephew, you could gut it and put some shelves in it for her."
Black TV's matter
I had one of those old tvs but it was huge. Like 30+ inches on the screen. I used to play snes and n64 on it. This was in like 2007/8 btw lmao.
That’s adorbs.
Works for me!  She didn't have to purchase a new TV stand.  All it needs is a nice tablecloth!
She has a lovely entertainment totem.
"My Great-Aunt did something similar for my grandparents.  Console TV finally died on them (20+ years of service) and they got a ""portable"" style replacement with the same size screen.  Great Aunt came over and saw this TV-on-top-of-a-TV and went and grabbed her toolbox.

She removed the innards of the console TV, cut out the control panel area, put down some plywood to reinforce the bottom, and set the new TV inside the old.  10 years later my Mom and I replaced the tube TV with a flat panel that almost perfectly fit the whole opening, and that lasted my Grandpa the rest of his days."
"When you get something new, but aren't ready to give up the old one"
My family does this. We dont use either TV though because I didn't want to pay for cable if no one watches tv anymore.
"My paternal grandparents also did this.

Large console TV at the bottom, Chinese-made Magnavox CRT-TV on top."
Big brain
"I still have the old TV behind the new one to put the settop box on. It also holds power bars, splitters, etc. inside."
"Karl Pilkington level of interior decorating. Remember in the podcast when he said his uncle had two TVs, one that only worked for sound and one that worked for picture so whenever he wanted to watch something he had to turn both on to get the full experience"
I did that once. I called it the tower of technology.
Finally a multi-monitor setup!
"Growing up, we had one of the TVs that was something like 4-5 feet long, all wood and weighed a couple hundred pounds. It stayed in the same spot for years after it died and we put the replacement on top."
I guess you gotta be smart in life. And this arrangement obviously saves the cost of buying a proper table. So I’d say well done auntie
"Love it.

That's from an age where things were built to last. They valued you and not the boards fat wallet."

Very nice idea
Can’t play Duck Hunt on the LED tv...Even Great-Aunts know that.
The flatscreen is just asserting its dominance
I can’t wait to see her next tv setup.
"I can smell the wood paneling from here. my god this is nostalgia.

also, jeff foxworthy has a joke about this."
this is so cute!
She should name the bottom TV “The Great Aunt’uin”.
"An age old tradition. She probably has cookie tins and Country Crock plastic bowls full of stuff stashed everywhere, too."
"Maybe I'm just weird, but IMHO that looks pretty cool!"

My dad did this lol. I eventually got him a sheet to put on the old tv to cover it up so it wasn’t so distracting. He doesn’t want to get rid of the tv since it’s one of the only things he has left of his parents :(
I thought was normal. My grandparents did the same thing.
That’s a big brain = big pp great aunt right there
The bottom TV is gonna our last the top TV. Haha
This is some classic TV upgrade stacking that's been happening since the first TVs. I still remember my family watching the 90s tv stacked on the 70s TV as a stand.

My Grandma had done this as well. They also had about 3 layers of VCR / VCR DVD / DVD players going on.
"I love this! I had a Mitsubishi 35"" tv back around 1995. It was the largest picture tube at the time. I think they offered a 40"" the next year. This is all pre-flatscreen mind you. It was in a beautiful light oak cabinet on wheels and probably weighed over 100lbs. I sold it for like 50 bucks. Wish I still had it."
It's big brain time!
"I remember as a kid my great grandfather doing this to his old black and white TV, whenever he finally got his first color television."
"My mom is currently using the bottom of an old sewing machine, one of those pedal ones, and also has a hollowed out TV console that has a new TV inside (which is annoying because you have to hold the remote at the correct angle to get it to work)."
I'm having flashbacks to the late 70s and early 80s. The old TV! The carpet! The wood paneling!
Strangely stylish
"She used the television, to support the television"
This is so 70’s
"Can confirm, my dad and I went to an old woman's house to install a twin wall chimney in her house, we were installing the chimney in a garage her husband was in the process of converting to a man cave of sorts. Their were little handles on the sides of the TV to make it easier to move, the second we got it off the ground the handles totally snapped off and the weight of the TV made one of the legs go straight through the flooring and hit the underlay. Thankfully the husband saw what happened and understood the situation"
"I very nicely let my ex take our huge ass one when we split. (I bought it originally)

As in, I didn’t want to lift that thing. He still has it. He loves it. Win/win."

And I mean it looks nice. I like collecting antique electronics and cameras so i might be biased but that's a beautiful old cabinet set. Hell you take that to the right dealer and that's a chunk a change for you in that good of cond8
Also you gotta pay money to dispose of them.
"Hell, even 2000s vintage HDTV weigh a ton."
"I nearly did myself a real injury getting our old 34"" wide screen home from the store.  It felt like it was filled with bricks i swear. the 50"" flat we have now was an absolute breeze by comparison"
had to carry a ton of those bastards a couple of years ago sometimes out of the 3rd or 4th floor while delivering flatscreens. My back hurts just from looking at this picture
They also cost money to dispose of now.
"My brother and I literally did the same thing. We had this big 300lb TV we struggled to get into our apartment. So when we upgraded to a nice flat screen, we just stuck it on top of the old tv til we moved. 99% sure we left the old TV there when we did lol the thing was just too much of a monster."

When I was little the larger TV in the living room broke one day. My dad went and got the smaller one from the other room and sat it on top of the broken one. That night we just so happened to watch a Jeff Foxworthy special with that joke. We had a good laugh and my dad went out first thing in the morning and bought a new one so he wouldn't catch shit from his buddies.
‘If you have a matching set of salad bowls and they all say cool whip on the side’ is my familiar familial Foxworthy
"Funny story.

My grandmother and I were very close, may she rest in peace; she was my mother for all intents and purposes, she raised me and she was my best friend ever. About ten years ago or more now I'm estimating, we were watching TV like usual, and we came across what I think was the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" as we were channel surfing, I'm not sure which one but we hadn't seen it yet. We couldn't resist, these guys were favorites of ours and it was one of those things we just *had* to watch if it was on, much like 'America's Funniest Home Videos' or 'Touched By An Angel'. Mind you, this was before streaming services were a thing.

Jeff Foxworthy was doing his routine. Suddenly, he says, ""If your working TV sits on top of your *non-working* TV....you might be a redneck!""

I looked at my grandmother. She looked at me. We looked at the TV: our Zenith television which was sitting on top of her huge and much older defunct Zenith that we used in the '90s. And we burst our laughing, apparently we were rednecks! It was one of those moments like in the movies, we felt called out and it was hilarious. I never thought of myself as being too redneckish, but I take pride in it; it's a happy memory of my grandmother that was just the two of us being exactly who we were, a couple of ol' rednecks living in a trailer park, laughing at ourselves."
My first thought.

"When I was a student in the 80s, we rented a TV from a 2nd-hand shop round the corner. When the picture broke, the guy lent us another one. So we had 2 TVs, one for the picture and one for the sound."
She’s used it as a stand for every television she’s had since it broke. Way sturdier than my IKEA stand I’ll tell you.
" Grandmas house early ninety six. Never even questioned it.  Of COURSE there’s a tv on a tv, why wouldn’t there be?"
I was going to say... this is tradition for people who would have watched a TV like the one on the bottom. We had our rec room TV on a TV for most of when I was in high school. This was in Canada
Yep... You had that big console tv until it broke and then the newer smaller one on top of it for the next 10 years.
Yup.  Every single house in our family had this setup at one point or another.
"Same.  I'm kinda chuckling at the ""kids"" here who love/hate it.  This was the standard in almost every home.

I remember that last console TV my dad and I brought home:  A gorgeous maple cabinet with black felt-covered speakers on either side of the 25"" color screen!!!  Maaaaan, that thing was the future!  This was 1993, so not that long ago I suppose.  When that TV died around 2005-ish, the flat panel we bought dad went right on top of it."
"I had my grandparents old late 70s, early colour TV with just 8 channel buttons all the way into the early 2000s. Was a good quality picture and the speaker, despite being mono, was still better than the tinny shit you get on modern TVs. 

Sadly it just turned off once around 2003 and wouldn't turn on again, and a weird smell came out of it. Probably just a busted capacitor but no way I was opening that shit up to fix it - iirc you could get deadly electric shocks from those old TVs even with the power detached."
"Yea, literally everyone did this in the 80's and 90's."
You should say to them hey what's on tv?
"They should turn it into a bar. Carefully take the screen and tube out, add some leds and have a classy place to store your bottles.
Alternatively- a fish tank."
Yeah I'd have done this too. I love old TV units.
There's actually some cool projects people have posted online of taking those old wooden cased console TVs and removing the electronics and using the wooden shell to hold aquariums and other stuff.
Clever
"So did we! At the end of the day I used to turn the volume up as high as it would go, in the hopes that my dad wouldnt notice until when he turned it on when he got up in the morning... good times!"
Yeesss. What the hell is up with the soundbar obsession? I want big speakers and hi-fi man.
My dad and I converted an old radio cabinet into a liquor cabinet years ago. Much better to hide ALL the alcohol.
It will be able to carry more TVs for sure.

It’s not a secret. She does.
So he stole a joke from Jeff Foxworthy?
Uncommon. Must have been the biggest relief when you saw that he was reasonable and didn’t blame you for trying to help him. He could have held you liable for his floor when you were just helping an old man with some garbage.
"Our tv had handles as well because it was “portable”. Same thing when we went to lift it by the handles, the handles snapped off. That thing probably weighed 100lbs."
"> Their were little handles on the sides of the TV ~~to make it easier to move~~

Those were ornamental.  They've always been ornamental."
"The contract company I had worked for absolutely forbade us from being ""friendly"" and helping move TVs, etc, after one of our techs rolled an old lady's (think 80 years old) unplugged big flatscreen TV (the old box kind on wheels) across her basement. He plugged it in and the TV didn't work. She sued for the price a of a new TV and won.

I had a lady try and claim damage against me. They were moving in and set their LCD flatscreen down in front of me. I had *them* plug it into the wall. I then turned on the TV with the remote and turns out the screen was damaged. They had transported it in the back of a Jeep unsecured. She tried to file a claim and blame me even though I had never physically touched the TV."
"A restaurant chain that ive upgraded the AV in used to hang them from these huge contraptions,  held up by 2 pieces of unistrut and an inch and a half black pipe. These things are ridiculously hard to remove while on a ladder.

Long story short,  those handles are garbage."
The old Tv through the floor grift. Never fails.
How do you know he still has it
"And all the weight is in the front and it's super awkward to grab. When my parents finally decided to get rid of their old 36 inch sony tube tv, my brother and I wanted to throw it down the stairs because it was so heavy and awkward. However, we knew if we did that it would probably go through the stairs and fall into the basement."
"Can confirm! Sony VEGA, because screw you, who needs to move a TV anyway!"
I just got a 32” on Amazon and I swear it weighs 3lbs
Which is impossible because those old CRTs never stop working.

This seems like it should be in a film about student life in the 80s lol.
Isn't that literally a gag in Mary and Max (2009)?
i bought my parents a new tv last year and they did the exact same.  I mounted it on the fireplace and had it set up nice.  I get called back to put it on the old tv.  Old tv wasn't broken.  It just sucks.  They still do not know how any of it works.
Just missing the giant doily on it.
"You have to discharge the flyback transformer. The common method is with a screwdriver and a wire attached to ground. Either that, or you could just wait several hours for parasitic resistance to drain everything naturally.

"Dude, tell me about it. I decided to move my ex gfs big ass 50inch zenith projection tv. Holy shit was that one of the hardest diy jobs. Long story short, I buried it in her backyard lol."
"Well that's just misleading, and with a TV like that being decades old most people aren't gonna realize that the handles are just for show."
"Because some people don't completely ghost their exes, they just realize they don't work as a couple and move on. I dated someone twice, about 5 years with about a year apart in the middle. I wouldn't even consider going back to a relationship at this point 4 years out but we still talk about once a month."
I see it every so often when we exchange our kid.
Somebody has never had lightning hit their TV antenna
Bet you it takes 8 minutes for the screen to get to full brightness
My dad told me that a powerful magnet could mess with the colors on a CRT screen when I was a kid. What he didn't tell me is that the effect could be permanent-ish... Yeah that was a pretty stressful couple of hours for 8-year-old me until things went back to normal.
"The old black and white ones would last more or less forever, but the color ones did fade eventually with the whole screen turning blue and the picture fading away."

"I am not a lawyer, this does not constitute legal advice. Any true inquiries should be handled by a lawyer, which I am not. 
Typically, if you offer to help someone (especially if they didn't ask for your help, you offered unsolicited) and you cause damage, you're absolutely responsible for those damages. Whether it be to a person or thing. Basically when you offer to help someone without being asked you're saying ""I know how to do this and will do it for you"" so if you fail and cause damage, you misled the homeowner into believing you could accomplish the task properly when you couldn't or didn't. (this is why I have that disclaimer, if I'm wrong about what I'm saying, and you tried to get a settlement and failed, you could sue me for giving false legal advice) Plus, if the homeowner wasn't protected imagine how bad that would be; just go to your enemies house offer to help move something and then intentionally drop it or damage it. It's pretty hard to prove someone's intent like that, at least beyond the ""benefit of a doubt""."
"It’s funny, I guessed 100lbs thinking, “That’s heavy for a TV, right?” but it was likely closer to 200lbs. I’ll ask my parents the next time I talk to them. 

That TV became a part of our family, partially because it was so heavy, but also because of economics. Eventually it couldn’t produce the colour red. If you smacked it on the side you’d get the full colour spectrum of Red Green Blue for a minute or so, but that glory was always short lived."
That shit weighs more than I do
That's very similar to a 1080i Samsung my dad has. It was bloody huge and at the time he jokingly said he bought it specifically because too was waaaaaay too big for house burglars to lift and go off with.

"I'm still friends with my first husband - he and his new wife have me over for dinner when I go visit my mom in their state, and he came to my state to visit our (grown) kids and stayed at my house with me and my current husband.

I also lived for 3 years with my current husband's ex wife (it was him, me, his ex, THEIR teenage son and my teenage son) when she inherited a huge house in L.A. and offered us to live there rent free and both go back to school.  It's nice to be not angry and stay friendly, if you can.  Especially when there are kids involved."
My friend was on and off in the relationships with the same girl with a lot of dating and romances in between for years. Then they grew up and settled and about a month ago they had a second son.
I'm still good good friends with my ex-boyfriend of three years.  We also lived together too.  We even worked out our own breakup together.  We just weren't compatible in interest or lifestyle and we were just kind of exhausted from forcing it.
1 old TV = 1 kid
Sounds like the TV might be the easiest thing to replace in that scenario.
"Maybe it did hit the bottom TV.  The top one has most likely never been on an antenna and has always been connected to the cable system.

When installed properly, rooftop antennas had a thick wire that ran directly to the ground which would divert most of the lightning bolt away the same way a lightning rod would.  Electricity likes to follow the path of least resistance, and the thick wire to the ground provides less resistance than the thin wire to the TV.  The TV is still connected to the ground through the neutral wire in it's power cord so the TV could still be damaged but was unlikely to take the full force of the lightning bolt."

kids can keep you on good terms long enough for all the old grudges to be forgotten i can testify to that. I'd never want to go back but we sometimes even share a laugh these days thanks to our 3 sons
"My mum when she originally dated my dad dumped him for being too boring. She got married & divorced with some other dude, then got back with my dad a few years later."
It.. it wasn't before.
"I think in most cases people just say ""we wont move furniture"" or they charge you a fee to move it. When I had my floors installed I had to move all the furniture or pay an extra $400 for them to move it."
"I agree it's not ideal, but that's what insurance is trying to do, balance risk and figure out fault. Unfortunately they're just incentivized to pay the old man as little as possible (minimal fault) while taking more from the installers through increased payments (increased risk) and no one wins"
public liability insurance yes in case you cause injury or damage. there is no way to ' enforce the legal standard of this particular old man's judgement. ' because it will always be your word against theirs.
"In civil law everything goes out the window, you can sue someone and request a jury trial as the plaintiff. So you only need to convince a jury that
You were harmed. In America you each pay for your own attorney fees (unless a specific law or agreement states otherwise) so someone can sue you and you still have to go to court and answer the lawsuit. If you don't respond properly you can lose by default."
">legal standpoint

>little more common sense

Oh my sweet summer child."
Not if I'm *into* her.
"Yeah, we have that weird concept that you can only date one person once, and never get back together at all. I think that's one of the last weird concepts around sexuality and dating that we have that haven't been dismantled or discussed - unlike pre-marital sex, sex for pleasure rather than procreation, multiple partners, you name it. 

So, for some reason, yes, it's considered impossible to get back together years later. I guess it's impossible if none of you changed at all, you are set in stone and basically dead as a person. People change, a lot, really. And their perspectives and values change, too."
I know but the sarcasm in me couldn't stop
Same rule applies to IT. I can't count how many times people assume I'm going to move their desk for them. Nope. I'm not insured for damage moving your desk. I'm not touching it.
"Yeah, i'm a flooring installer not a mover. Want me to move your shit, I'm charging a premium."
Insurance wins. It's literally playing against the house

Just smile through it...
It’s strange seeing him.
"You should watch his TED Talk, he's a very fun guy"
What language is it?
"I know very little German and most of it is cursing so, ‘Fick dich du kleine fotze’ and have a very lovely day"
Epic script.
Is “Das OTTO” a pun of “Das Auto”?
Sprich deutsch du hurensohn
Otto is a bad website but they got pretty awesome advertising
"They can advertise, but the prices are way too high in comparison to most other retailers..."
AFAIK 'Otto' is an old fashioned mail order business where only old folks order from. This ad is probably trying to change the perception of the brand. 'Old Spice' is trying the same thing with their ads after they discovered customers think of them as grandpa products.
"this is honestly incredibly well done, they somehow managed to make it not cringy

I'm happy that he's become so famous and that people are actually hiring him to do stuff like this, he was just some random hungarian guy that posed for some stock photos, he was only really identified on the internet and became famous in 2016. The meme obviously goes back further than that but nobody knew who he even was before 2016 when he confirmed it and posted some stuff to social media."
Warum wird er so heiß? Oder was anderes?

"Of course it's not unusual in the UK to see menus in French, but I once took some Americans to a posh restaurant for a business lunch and they just looked at the menus with puzzled expressions and it took me a moment to realise why.

Go on give peas a chance.
There it is! Theres the comment. Exactly what my grandad used to say.
It's got way too much avec.
Only as an optional smear across the plate for an extra €5.
Thank you.
"Aha thanks! Stay tuned, it’s a palate cleanser next week."
Yay for bean flower!
Took some frying I can you.
Ps happy cake day!
C'est une grande frite
"Spotters badge! That *is* indeed a nasturtium sprout, as last weeks tarragon had gone to shit. I think it makes the bean flower look more *YAY!* I added agar agar to the beans to try and get them to set which sort of worked (compared to last week anyway)."
Don’t have another pic from that angle but can indeed confirm it was indeed a square edged chonker. Fried once at 130 for 15 minutes then again at 180 to brown it up.
Asking the important question....
"Well, I’ve only got six plates so it’ll have to be six on first sitting then the last two afterwards that ok?"
"Mange tout, mange tout."
Dee Dee!
"This vividly reminded me of the time I saw someone in halls have for dinner risotto, with baked beans and peas for their dinner. I was amazed. Their plate was basically three triangles of different coloured round things. I still think about it sometimes."
Peas are beans so if you have peas then you have both.
"Aha cheers, palate cleanser next week ahead of dessert!"
"It was Warburtons Thick White Toastie! Wasn’t toasted though, it was cut to size earlier and left to go stale for an hour so it could better absorb any lonely chip grease."
"Palate cleanser next week, stay tuned!"
I keep trying to do stars on here and half disappear and half go wonky.
"I own a Coffeeshop in London, but we don’t sell anything like this sadly, doubt we’d get away with it!"
More like “Kaching!” I reckon. Whole menu gonna cost less than a fiver to make haha.
Aww that’s sweet!
"If every course was an uneasy assault on your tastebuds, sensibilities, morals and existence we wouldn’t get any repeat customers. Even Heston only does snail poo for one course, I imagine he brings out a plate of chips at the end."
"That was disturbing on many levels, especially the texture of eating that manger. Well they can’t all be winner winner chicken dinners, still got a few to go before this feast is over! Edit typo"
I’ve got a coffeeshop in London but we wouldn’t get away with this sadly haha
"Can’t make everyone question their existence and life choices with every mouthful, you want them to go home a little confused not sectioned."
"One of the mods u/bigbeanmarketing last week said my “dedication to subtly offend knows no bounds”, and in my 46 years on this planet I feel like someone has finally, completely and utterly, understood me in one sentence. I felt skewered and it was wonderful."
"Zut alor! Thanks! Weird thing is I post these on my insta too and they get like 13 likes the fickle bastards. The last one I stuck on Facebook, no likes and one comment “you on drugs?”"
"Thanks! It’s a palate cleanser first, we’re not heathens. But then dessert, and then cheese."
"Aww thanks, best part of my week!"
yer wha
Humbled. Blessed. Touched.
Mange tout!
"It’s supposed to be a rollercoaster, knock you off balance but you go home happy not puking into a bucket. Stay tuned tho...."
"Twice, at 130 then 180. Didn’t want to par boil first as wanted a, er, *crisp* edge at the expense of a texture you can’t see on a pic."
Mange tout!
Customs in the rest of the time.
Yeah it’s the best bit of my week hahah
"Plenty of time for that, palate cleanser next, then dessert, then cheese!"
Stay tuned! It’s downhill from here!
Thanks! Lot tidier than last week!
Not on Tuesdays!
"€10 extra if you’re sitting outside, which we all have to."
It was when I dumped the rest of the beans and the ‘failed’ chips over the top yeah
Were they in a mini shopping trolley?
You know I could just say I’ve done that as you lot can’t taste it.
Aww imma frame this comment.

"Well, I think they all look really good and I’m president of the Wanker Union."
I tried to make up for the singular chip by making it the size of a fence post.
Never had it.
"No potato involved as far as I can tell. “Frite” as far as I’ve caught on from Québécois French can either be used to mean fried potatoes (shortened from pomme frits), or just something fried, which I have learned to assume in British english, is what adding the word “chip” on to something means. Like potato chips are fried potatoes. We just shortened them down to chips, or “fried” as it were, like our upstairs neighbors did with French fries. If that made any sense."

I've been planting out some Nasturtium seedlings that the kids grew so I thought it looked familiar. I generally know sod all about plants.

Will there be a cheese course?

It actually says thank you NHS now
"Hopefully not this year, but fook knows might be doing this every week until heinz runs out of beans."
"If you’re sitting outside, like we all have to now, it’s an extra €20."
You’re not supposed to eat the garnish!
"Not sure yet. Gone modernist for one, French for another, inverted Heston-esque for one, so where next?! Who knows!"
My bean flower was an unruly mess last week. *blush*
I see you did there.
"You’re welcome! Anything that gets a giggle in these times is a rare treat so am loving doing these posts. Nasturtiums are great as a garnish, flowers too - or stick the flowers in a g&t if it’s sunny!

I have been using culinary tweezers hahah but just cos it’s a precision tool doesn’t mean the tool holding it is precise."
"It was terrible, I had to cut up about five massive spuds to get the size and cooking times right, didn’t want them to go to waste so had them with the rest of the can of beans minus the six in the garnish. Had to work against time though as I was a little ashamed of my messy bean flower last week (not a euphemism, but ashamed of that too thinking about it) so added some agar agar to the beans, they would have set solid if I hadn’t piled them all down."
One with six plates.
The whole thing would be pointless if it didn’t have a cheese course at the end. Fear not. Palate cleanser next week though.
Might be the name of my cookbook too haha.
"That’s a cracking idea, actually I’ll definitely do something or a freebee on those lines and add the shop info onto the final multi image summary post. Pop in for a brew! (when we open, whenever tf that is)

"Near waterloo station, will do a shameless plug at the end of all this as I don’t have a bandcamp page haha."

Ah thanks! Palate cleanser next!
And the English kitchen
€5 extra.
"Ah yeah, maybe I’ll add a special finale dessert on top"
Deep-fried with green bean ice cream inside?
An Eton tidy?
"Hmmn. Bit *american* tho, no?"
"Yeah got a tin of the Japanese stuff at the back of the cupboard I think, want to keep it to everyday stuff we all recognise though. Maybe if I wash the ketchup off and cover them in something else, beanz are just fookn beanz after all."

I feel like this has untapped potential as a saying

""I'm going to whoop his ass until Heinz runs out of beans"", for example."
I think you’re onto something here - Could be potential for ‘socially distanced’ plates where there’s big gaps between different food (smaller portions) for an extra cost.

How about sorbet au Jambon with haricot mousse?

Interesting."
Who the hell gifts baking soda with soap and chewing gum with baking soda
“I have no idea what you people want.”   - William Wrigley Jr.
They should start gifting playing cards with their gum.
And then they sold the Chicago Cubs.
This is the legal version of the drug dealer giving a free sample to get you hooked
Adapt or perish - a metaphor for humanity.
Why didnt they just keep selling the soap and baking soda too?
So where's my free shit when I buy my chewing gum?
Incredible adaptability!
Juicy Fruit is the best.
Baking powder is a wonderful gift
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
"Continuing the tradition of give-aways, every shareholder of Wrigley’s would receive 20 packs of gum as a yearly tradition."
And due to Corona they could start giving soap as gift with their gum and the circle of life is complete.
What did they package with the gum?
"They should consider selling their gum with tiny gift-soaps.

Now THAT would be a great marketing strategy."
That’s fascinating
I find it amazing how business ideas evolve overtime
"Ironically, the Chicago Cubs baseball stadium Wrigley Field, which was named after the same William Wrigley in 1927, has been a notable exception to the trend of selling corporate naming rights to sporting venues."
"Improvise, adapt, overcome."
Similar to how Bazooka Joe created Saturday Night Live.
"No gift with the gum, they ain't falling for that one again"
***PIVOT!***
‘And in 2020 they started giving free toilet rolls with their gum’ - Probably
"Shit son, how good was this baking powder??"
"They should have made the same leap as Topps, selling baseball cards"
"*Ross*:

PIVOT

...

PIVOT!"
r/todayilearned
"The same sort of thing happened with Daisy BB guns, one free with every windmill purchase.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Outdoor_Products"
r/todayilearned
They should start selling edibles with their gum...
"If at first you don't succeed, try and try again."
"Must have gone to the Geller School of Management

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n67RYI\_0sc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n67RYI_0sc0)"
Task failed successfully x2?
"This gave a whole new meaning to   
IMPROVISE ADAPT OVERCOME"
Task failed successfully
"Improvise, Adapt, Overcome"
Never chew
"“Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.”"
Theres always a bigger fish
Also interesting Is Lamar's transition from a tobacco and cigarette company to a marketing company due to them owning nearly every billboard along major roads which they originally purchased to promote their cigarette brands.
Task failed successfully
Cleaning product -> Food product -> Sugar
"That's like how Epic worked for 7 years on a co-op zombie shooter where you collect resources during the day and defend your collective fort at night. About a week after release, they threw together a free Battle Royale mode that wasn't supposed to be anything more than a demo and here we are."
Then they started including meth with every stick
"I wonder what it would be like in the meeting room when they pitch the idea. 

“Hey, what about giving a chewing gum for every baking soda we sell? That a good combo, right guys?”

“You son of a bitch! I’m in!”"
Yes.  They eventually broke the cycle by making it sugar free gum.  People thought they were buying sugar and getting free gum.
Yes as long as is wrigleys sugar free shit
Yes!
"Don’t forget about big red, winter fresh, juicy fruit and double mint.  Also lifesavers and Altoids."
Bazooka?
Now Wrigley's is owned by Mars Incorporated
Mentos?
zebra stripe is the only i can think of lol
"There's a few they don't own. Cadbury owns Bubblicious, Chicklets, and Stride; Topps owns Bazooka; Hershey owns Bubble Yum, Ice Breakers, and Fruit Stripe; Mondelez owns Dentene.

But you're right. For the most part, if you're grabbing a pack of gum in the store, Wrigley's is probably the parent company: Five, Big Red, Doublemint, Extra, Hubba Bubba, Juicy Fruit, Orbit, Winterfresh, Wrigley's Spearmint (obviously)..."
Trident?
Orbit
Hubba Bubba?
"Wikipedia may need to be updated.  All it mentions is the baking power/gum connection.

Edit:  I was wrong.  Its just in a different place:

> In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap.[14] Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921."
Thanks for the link. It was interesting!
Yeah I was thinking it was a very odd combo! The gifting itself was weird. I wonder if this was a common thing back then?
They should start selling tobacco.
"....I'm a lifelong baseball fan, and it's possible I just now realized what Wrigley Field is named after."
Correct. They only like profitable ventures.
Is he giving it away with packs of gum?
and then...
Seems like they dropped the ball on the baking soda while focusing on gum. Some big guy with an arm and a hammer moved in and stole one of their ladies.
That stuff is good! If only the taste lasted for more than a nano second
"Hang on don’t they sell stick gum anymore? God I am out of the loop!! 
Those small pellets/tabs whatever you call them are not the same as unwrapping paper and foil and folding that sweet goodness into your mouth"
I have stick gum in my purse right now that I bought at either Safeway or Target. It's Extra so it's even Wrigley's. Definitely still a thing although less of a variety. You can even still buy Blackjack and Clove gum at candy stores especially.
Good bot
This is one of those double meant phrases isn’t.
"Wriggly’s spearmint isn’t sugar free, neither is juicy fruit. Do they make sugar free gum? I thought they were the last gum with sugar left."
When they went 'Sugar Free' and people never got their free sugar is when it all went downhill for them.
Lmao! this comment is getting Gold!
This comment is too good to be original. Reddit has taught me that everything on the internet is stolen.
"Jesus, they really do own everything!"
"I’ll give you that, but I’ll also say that I didn’t know Bazooka gum existed before this comment hehe"
"No, Hubba Bubba"
Hey I'm right next to Mars Wrigley right now!
"While they *do* have a gum range now, they aren’t really a primary producer of gum and Mentos gum has only experienced a fraction of the success of other gum brands."
"Never heard of it if I’m honest, but Google says that’s a Wrigley child too"
"Nah man, that shit’s owned by Wrigley’s too!"
everybody clapped?
"Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.57923% sure that TooShiftyForYou is not a bot.

double mint phrases?
It isn't isnt
Did you just gold yourself?
boo
Even the original comments
"They also do skittles and starburst.  ALSO, they are a division of Mars, who makes M&Ms, Snickers, Milky Way, Twix and 3 Musketeers"
Now it's time for Bazooka to realize people like the free comics that come with it and not the crappy gum.
"Wt, you've never heard of Orbitz gum? Are you Patrick star, living under a rock?"
Ah yeah thats actually true but not with Pedro
Wow!  They’ve got it all locked up.
It's the statement of the great mint in double mint gum.
[thatsthejoke.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/utzTCyo.jpg)
Wish it were possible. Lol I'd give myself gold to avoid ads without paying.
Was it you? Lol
Especially those.
"Not to mention basically every pet food worth their salt as well. Whiskas, Temptations, Schmackos, all owned by Mars"
"This. I'm still waiting for the episode where Bazooka Joe finally asks Jane to marry him, for real this time. I'm such a softy for that kind of thing."
The gum is delicious for about as long as it takes to read the comic
">and not the crappy gum.

Not quite sure Bazooka actually qualifies as gum."
"It seems I am indeed Patrick Star, living under a rock"
The only thing they don’t own that’s major is Trident
"This was a yummy thread about bubble gum.

It was bubble yum."
"Hello, I am a Redditor! I have gifted you the Gold Award, yay! If you haven't received it by now, [click here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) to receive your well deserved gold award! You know what to do, go get it!"
"Wait, so Mars is trying to dominate Earth by taking control of food production starting with sweets and pet food?  Earth must retaliate!"
They actually make more on pet food then they do on all that chocolate and gum
Isn't that grocery store-grade petfood that sucks?
"The other half is Nestle. 

Purina, Beneful, Fancy Feast, Friskies."
Maybe it will make an unexpected comeback like Archie did a few years ago
"It's in there, keep chewing!"
"If that's they're endgame, Nestle's going to beat them for sure."
"But don't forget they also make petroleum based cleaning products like Mr. Clean and Lysol, and through their petroleum division they are also the number 3 largest oil producer in the world and okay I made all this up, I just wanted to participate."
Yeah but Nestle is a shitty company that denies human rights so fuck them and their products.
Pssst..you can tell everyone they make uncle bens rice and Combos

Comment
And 2020 continues on
"If you actually followed the situation on North Korea, this comes as no surprise. [This tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/chadocl/status/1271795812218163200) from last week even predicted this demolition.

Ever since Trump walked away from the Hanoi summit with no deal, Kim Jong un has been stuck with a leverage (nukes) that it cannot use to get what he wanted (sanctions relief).

Unpopular opinion here, but even if North Korea never intended to give up its nukes, it would have been much better to agree on partial sanctions-relief for partial denuclearization. 

Because as long as the fundemental issue isn't resolved through talks, military tensions will continue. I'm actually surprised that they waited this long to escalate again.

It was harder this time as NK had to come up with a bogus excuse to raise tensions, since South Korea has done literally nothing wrong nor break any treaties. The current administration in S.Korea is the most generous and receptive government that North Korea would probably ever have as a partner, but to catch the US's attention, they nevertheless had to use S.Korea as a punching bag. 

South Korea can't do much (despite really wanting to pursue economic intergration projects with the North) without breaking the UN sanctions.

The US still holds the keys to global sanctions on North Korea, and yet has short attention spans that only flare up when NK seems like a legitimate threat (like back in 2017). Thus North Korea would inevitably test the boundaries using their threats until a compromise is reached."
"I am so mad with my neighbor!


Blows up my home instead.


Btw, guess Kim’s sister is establishing some sort of authority right now by making scenes."
Damn I guess it's that time of the year where north Korea acts like a child having a tantrum so they can get some international aid to stop.
"And in other news, china killed 3 Indian Army personnel at the Ladakh border stand-off. Happy WW3"
Somebody needs some aid again.
"They blew up a building on their own side with warning that it was going to happen. 

This is the North sending a petty message towards the South because balloons keep flying in to North Korea with anti-NK leaflets. 

North Korea had to respond to look tough, remember when Iran launched missiles onto an Air base in retaliation for the assassination of Sulemani? It was done with precision to ensure minimal casualties, all while looking tough on their state media. 

Same shit here. There was an artillery barrage and a brief firefight between the Koreas a few years ago and nothing came of it."
Seeing how building was on their side of border they essentially just blew up their own building. Mostly symbolic. Almost petty like a cry for attention
"Korea Times-

This explosion was “expected”.


https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=291306"
"Chinese soldiers just killed 3 Indian soldiers in their ongoing border dispute , so there is that."
Well this is escalating quickly.
"Now this is showy!

The sister might really be in charge now, remember, when Lil-Kim took over he ordered the navy to blow up a South Korean ship, to show the old men in the army that he means business."
"Yup, clearly Covid is an issue in North Korea.

Time for an external enemy to prevent internal revolt."
Oh god the 2020 disaster meme just might be a reality
I bet it was Kim Yo-Jong flexing. She's threatened violence recently.
I'm not liking this season of Earth. It seems like the writers are just throwing every idea they can come up with and none of them seem to tie together. There are so many subplots that just vanish. The characters are just laughably written and take actions that just don't make any sense.
"... I am convinced Kim Jung-Un is dead. His sister made the announcement, and now, and they're displaying a show of force to show people they're still not to be trifled with."
"I still remember my dad defending Trump to me purely based on his prediction that ""trump has done something no one else has - reunited the two Koreas together. I bet Kim might even step down now and let democracy reign. I can't believe this is happening in my lifetime!""

While I just rolled my eyes and said ""sure dad. I'm sure all that is going to happen""."
"So we can assume that Kim jong Un is dead after the surgery? And his sister is trying to get into power with some aggressive movements, because there were no mass propaganda preparations to transfer power?

How exactly North koreans feel about women in power?"
"South Korea to the rest of the world: ""Just a typical tuesday in our neighborhood. Don't worry about it."""
Anyone got the Shrek meme template where Shrek is humanity asking donkey as 2020 to stop trying to kill us all for 5 minutes?
"Kim jong un is dead, long live the dictatorship. The sister is flexing her muscles, telling the world that she is as unpredictable as the brother, don't mess with her."
"Gee, it's like a kid throwing a tantrum."
might as well get another world war out of the way before end of the year
South Korea should retaliate by blowing up one of its own buildings... oh wait.
"""NOTICE ME USA!"""
And the Mayan Calander has an alternative ending to the world next week.
Calm down 2020!!
Well that was rude of them.
Exhibit A
Can you double down in bingo? Cause I'm getting close to a full sheet.
They behave like children who aren't getting enough attention.
Like a little kid pitching a tantrum
lil’ sis is having her coming out party. Empty building and they’d already warned it was a target
 That’s a bit childish if you ask me
Great to see how WW3 is still an option this year. Almost forgot about that one.
Can’t we all just get along?
holy shit this is not good
"In a twist, Trump decides to send troops to the border to defend North Korea from the aggressive propaganda balloons from the south."
"This is the country equivalent of a child throwing a tantrum. In this case, the tantrum is yet another internal power move. Chinese diplomats in the cable-gate leaks actually likened dealing with the country to dealing with a spoiled child."
And /worldnews implodes into a ball of fearmongering and ranting about WW3 in 3...2...1
"Just blew it up, huh. Bit melodramatic."
"Well, at least this is world news that's actually about somewhere else in the world besides the UK, HK, or the USA."
North Korea bombs itself.
bruh
"Still 6 months of 2020 left aswell, what could possibly go wrong."
"''The destroyed site, which is in the North's territory, was opened in 2018 to help the two Koreas - technically in a state of war - to communicate.''

It is just another propoganda move, thats all"
"I missread this as:   


>*North Korean blows joint liaison officer in South in border town.*

I dont need coffee, i need a GF."
Someone please tell them to extend the truce until next year. 2020 is booked full.
Karen Yo-jong couldn't find the manager so she blew up the liaison office.
Damn when I blow up a joint it’s all in good fun but when NK does it that’s some evil shenanigans.
You know what? Nothing surprises me anymore.
"You had me at ""North Korea blows up"""
Does this mean a new season of M*A*S*H?
"Like little children, they’re not getting enough attention because of corona and protests."
Y’all trying to goto NK with me and capture Kim’s sister?
"Guys, can I get a new 2020 end of world Bingo Card? Mine is full."
Ok....who had new Korean War for 2020 Apocalypse Bingo?
Lol we haven't even started hurricane season yet
I don’t like the newest episode of Black Mirror
"Stay with me on this. Perhaps N. Korea has been so decimated by COVID that this is just a ploy to drum up much needed aid. Not saying it’s a positive, but perhaps they are not operating from a very strong position. Hopefully this is the flare up of a country on the verge of collapse? Maybe that’s just wishful thinking."
will someone just go take out that piece of shit.
"I wonder why they didn't just call Trump back for more talks.  His recent spectacular failures should make him an easy target for manipulation.  This just seems kind of silly, even as a symbolic gesture."
"If I am correct in which building this is, this was developed as a sort of sanctuary for SK and NK families to have a place to reunite. It never got used. So they essentially blew up a nice thought."
"Damn it BBC, you played right into NK's hands.  They only want attention because everyone is focused on other things in the world right now."
Kim ‘No One’s Paying Any Attention To Me’ Jong Un
"I generally try to keep up with what's going on around the world but I had unintentionally forgot about tensions on the Korean peninsula. With covid, George Floyd and resulting protests, my president being an idiot, the Netanyahu election/shityness, Bolsenaro, and the million other awful things in this world, I had forgotten this. Maybe baby man deluxe just wanted some attention from the world."
"Built by South Korean taxes, Blown by North Korean bomb."
Who had North Korea war on those bingo sheet?
Sucks that my first thought is: “Blows up” literally of figuratively? It’s hard to tell with headlines “wrecking” and “destroying” people these days.
"I see, the July disaster 2020 coming in early"
Sister is showing strength
"The South lost an empty building in the territory of North Korea...big whoop. Better than losing lives....which will not happen for a while as China is taking a bigger role in North Korea's economy. 


This was done as a response to South Korea dropping propaganda leaflets via balloons into the North....So they blow up a building they paid for. No lives were lost and the North gets propaganda material for their media."
"Stacey, we broke up two months ago."
So what did Barry Allen screw up this time?
Fackin norven monkees
That’s as close as Mini Me sister will come to blowing anything else!
"So, it's time for international aid again? Weird way of asking. I assume buddy's dead and this is his sister's way to make a splash?"
"Could they have not just re-purposed the building?

I preferred things when Jung Un was alive and in charge.

But this is the way it goes -  every new leader needs to rattle the sword a bit to keep the natives in line."
setting the stage for psycho sister
Please Kim put us out of our misery <3
Tune in next time for another episode of 2020!
Looks like the player of our world decided to abandon the Virus side-quest and continue on with World War 3
Reading this comments section made me realize how americans are the most tin foil hat people in the world. Damn.
I REALLY wish the guys from [Jib Jab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ThHrqlGdSk) would come out of retirement.
"That building was only one week away from retirement, too."
"As a Seoulite, all I can say is the KJY is a right cunt, and she’s throwing a temper tantrum. It’s weirdly juvenile"
But I thought Trump fixed this like he did China and the conflicts in the Middle East?
They blew up an empty building and the media is again over hyping.
On the next episode of 2020....
North Korea throws a little tantrum every year or so. This isn't anything new.
And I just quit from a news link about India lost 3 soldiers in the bord clash with China force. What a time.

"> Unpopular opinion here

nah what you suggested is the practical strategy for people not concerned about how it plays in the media politically.  Same with Iran in my opinion. If you think they are not playing by the rules, keep yourself with SOME players in the game instead of tipping the table and never knowing. The problem is American politics is such a way that the war hawks would play it off as weak by the US for giving NK an inch and Trump can't do anything that he thinks will play poorly in the press. The cost of this might be NK/SK lives but thats a risk he is willing to take to avoid a ""Trump signs weak deal with NK"" headline.  Its in my opinion why tribal politics is a cancer on humanity and why I think ego and manicuring media outcomes will result in LOADS of unnecessary deaths . So it may be unpopular but I think what you suggested is the practical and most effective way they should have gone, instead of thinking only about how they can tweet their ""win"""
Is S.K. actually eager for economic reunion? Everything I see seems to say they are against it.
"I was about to write ""why is it always Trump and U.S to fix every thing, if NK dont want a deal then they dont want a deal"" until i read

> The US still holds the keys to global sanctions on North Korea

Which also lead to U.N sanction and which is also the reason why economic integration with the two country wont happen. If N.K and South go to war again then U.S and U.N should be blamed"
Maybe weird suggestion but why not stop with the sanctions? The nukes he has already and wealth is maybe the only thing that the people make more demanding for freedom. What do we win with the sanctions now? Just keep the weapons sanctions and STP with the rest.
">Unpopular opinion here, but even if North Korea never intended to give up its nukes, it would have been much better to agree on partial sanctions-relief for partial denuclearization.

Yes but that's a reasonable compromise, NK would have never gone for it. The whole issue is that they're completely unreasonable."
"It was built and maintained with South Korean money, so they aren't the ones footing the bill"
She is a REAL drama queen
Isnt that typically in the spring?They are late this year
"""We're a third-world country but act like a first-world except when our supplies run low; then we cry and threaten to blow shit up til daddy gives us money"""
"Shooting themselves in the foot, escalating global tensions and aggressively claiming they're the poor victims. Got nothing but contempt for this country."
">Army sources say the soldiers were not shot but were killed in a physical fight on Indian Territory that involved stones and batons

Daaaamn"
Fuck.... I’m more worried about this than the despot in NK to be honest. India doesn’t fuck around.
"Two seperate border incidents aren't world war 3. Going by the amount of times people yell 'WW3!!!1!' on events that are highly unlikely to ever cause a global conflict, you'd think there's plenty of people here who want it to happen."
"China looking like it's having fights all around. Korea may be going off, Taiwan/Hong Kong issues, Indian excursions, trade wars on the horizon, disputes in the South China sea and no doubt more. Seems that belligerence isn't the key to a peaceful life. Who'd o'thunk it?"
"I am so tired of every western country turning a blind eye to china. We can call out the usa as much as we do, fact is, no country as putting serious tariffs and threats. It's disturbing me to not end, like are we waiting for china to invade a country or launch a nuke?"
Media reports not a shot was fired though. Just bludgeoned to death. Like that’s any better.
Get Dennis Rodman in there quick!
"The leaflets are targeted to antagonize Kim. The most recent ones that started all this had photo-shopped pictures of his wife claiming she does porn movies. 

Strange how none of the media show the content of the pamphlets. Only seen them on Korean twitter."
It was built and paid for by the South Koreans
Or a very safe way to say “Very important person newly making decisions for the good of DPRK.”
Anybody know if this is the building that Conan O'Brien visited? There's probably a bunch of these locations.
Expected since the sister said they'd explode it?
"Ahh... the true colors of the two old allies - North Korea and China - are coming out, today."
it always is with NK
New leader trying show she is tough and in charge
No sign of KJU and the sister in charge of the military.... looks like he’s out of action or dead.
I mean they do it perpetually. Pretty sure they've been in a perpetual state of war with South Korea that is only technically under ceasefire.
Something about a war with Eastasia?
"Not necessarily Covid itself, but the slowed down global economy is threatening to plunge the country into another great famine."
"Remember when everyone saw them do the whole ""peaceful"" handshake thing at their borders and everyone was like ""it's over!!! SK and NK are friends again!!1!"" Even though they've done that like 7 times throughout recent history and have NEVER stuck to it? 

I genuinely want to talk to anybody right now who was believing in Korean peace with a FUCKING DICTATOR in charge of one of the countries! Absolutely mental some people are."
Assuming this is him and not his sister.
Have we found out if Kim Jong Un is still alive? I thought he was a vegetable fertilizing the North Korean soil these days.
"Kim's dead, and his sister is assuming direct control."
He's dead. No more hiding it.
That usually happens when the show is cancelled early. Doesn't bode well for December.

-His recent absence from state television is pretty rare, but not unprecedented. There already has been several occasions where he was absent ranging from a few weeks to over a month. The only difference this time was that he was missing during the birthday anniversary of his grandfather - which is an important day in North Korea.

-It is reasonable to suspect that he had a surgery, as he had done an ankle surgery during his previous absence. Again, no correlation to the death rumor.

-Since the beginning of last month, he has reappeared on state television, albeit less frequent than usual. This has extinguished *most* speculations, and even the S.Korean public figures who've jumped on the rumors- have come out and apologized for misleading the public. 

As of now, continuing to argument that North Korea has been hiding the death of Kim for months is comfortably in the tinfoil hat territory, as it would require the belief that another look-alike has taken over Kim's identity and is running the country as usual. 

Sure, it is difficult to obtain reliable information in regards to North Korea, but it's getting silly pushing this argument based on a unconfirmed source from a Japanese tabloid media. As the saying goes, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."
That’s blackout bingo
"This is not such a bad thing. It means NK wants to talk. They just have problems communicating like normal nations.

NK: Provoke, ignore, and eventually deign to talk to SK and the US out of (choose one), mercy, pity, magnanimity.

Rinse, wash, repeat.

I live Seoul. Nobody has even raised an eyebrow. Just wearing our masks and washing our hands. It has been a beautiful day and have not seen or heard a single military airplane flying over Seoul.

Edit: two reactions in Seoul. ""Do they want rice?"", ""Let's not build in NK anymore, it's a waste of taxpayer money."""
"Meh, it's the political equivalent of a toddler whacking his sippy cup off the table. Nothing will happen."
"If you follow North Korean news for a while, this isn't anything unusual. Since 2000, North Korea shelled a South Korean island and sunk a warship, killing dozens of South Koreans, but no war happened. Can a war start from this? Sure, but it's much more likely this is just the usual saber rattling. 

If you want reassurance, most South Koreans, who are used to these provocations from the North, are going about their day like any other."
"NK firing artillery at SK town didn't restart the war, nor did sinking of an SK frigate (or some warship).

I doubt this is considered serious enough to start worrying about them turning the war hot again.

and Happy cake day!"
"It's as regular as death and taxes at this point.

""B-b-but this time is different!"""
Interesting idea - Perhaps Jung Un actually died from covid?
"I'm really hoping the next one is aliens, wouldn't that be neat."
The building was on North Korea's side of the border and has been empty for quite some time.

"Blowing up a building that is jointly shared by the north and south is pretty big compared to previous “tantrums”

Edit: not literally jointly shared, my bad. It was an office used for liaisons between the two countries, but is located in NK territory. Cutting off their nose I guess...

edit part deux: ok people, I interpreted tantrums to mean the usual threat of war or whatever propaganda piece NK chuck out. obviously direct attacks on SK are more severe and way worse than blowing up their own building."
His sister is in charge this year!
Yeah but this isn't their normal fucking narrative besides you can't throw a fit and run to the table asking for stuff if their is no table left
"I've been worried about that, India is only just now starting to really get hit with COVID, and for the past few months the news has said that China has amped up their aggression in the border conflicts in addition to their claims on the south china sea, which is why the US sent out the 3 carriers this week.  Bad times."
"We only halfway through this year, get ready for more"
His great friend is dead af clearly his sister wears the pants in the family.
"Probably because of this quote from the article

>The North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo-jong - considered a close and powerful ally - threatened to demolish the office in a statement at the weekend."
"Kim was looking at the tweet like, “hmmm that’s actually a pretty good idea”"
Kim Jong-Un’s sister said they should destroy it this past weekend. It’s not a prediction in that sense.
Because the places and ways NK can escalate without inviting their own destruction is limited.
Because NK said they would have cut ties and that the efforts made through the building of such lines would have been blown. People knew about this situation days ago.
Dude is smart and keeps up with North Korea. They don’t have a lot of cards to play in that country.
"Conversely, an official could sign the 'weak' deal and then actually explain why he did it. It's not about appearing weak in the press, it's about our current president thinking he is smarter than his advisors that would have explained this rather simple situation to him. And it really is simple, compared to the complex quagmire in the middle east or the delicate balance with Russia. It's not about nukes. Never has been. Like the OP said, the nuclear program is their one lever to get the USA to the negotiation table. They dont need nukes to demolish Seoul, but they do need nukes to get the US to actually give a shit about what happens."
"I think the older generations are more eager for it due to their past connections, where as the younger people have grown up only knowing the two Koreas as separate. Economically if the two reunited there would be a gigantic strain on the South Korean economy trying to basically get the North up to speed"
"One of my biggest pet peeves is seeing redditors parroting that South Korean youth are against reunification based on some random survey - and then morphing that into meaning that most Koreans are against reunification. This is a baseless statement being thrown around online.

In most serious discussions about reunification in S.Korea, it's not a matter of *If*, but *When*. People are against a hard reunification that results from a sudden collapse of the North. A Soft reunification on the other hand, process of reintegrating the North socially and economically through a process spanning years, is welcomed by the majority. A one country, two systems sort of approach if you will, but in unlike China, the end result would be one state under a democratic system. 

And regardless of people's feeling on the matter, North Korea being a part of South Korea is written into the **constitution**. Hence why any North Korean that shows willingness to defect and reach South korea are immediately recognized as South Korean citizens. There are horror stories about the discrimination that defectors face in S.Korea, and while it's definitely a problem, it's not the full picture either. There are many success stories of North Koreans who quickly adapt to S.Korean society. Gangnam, the biggest and richest district of Korea, is represented by a North Korean diplomat who defected just several years ago. That alone shows the willingness of the general public to re-intergrate their northern brethren.

As I said, it's a slow step by step process, and the current South Korean government has the plan ready and had already begun by connecting infrastructure such as roads and railroads, and investing in economic projects in the border area. The reasoning also goes that such interconnected economic projects would in time reduce the possibility of military tensions. Unfortunately, none of that can proceed in any meaningful manner since the US/UN has authority over the North/South border and prevents any sanctions-violations, while making no progress on US-NK negotiations.

Unfortunately, North Korea seems to have had enough of sitting around idly and returned to its aggressive tactics - much to the dismay of South Korea."
Most young South Koreans don't want it. Plus it would probably cause more harm and destability than anything else.
">why is it always Trump and the U.S to fix everything

Although it doesn't really apply in the NK situation, it certainly does elsewhere: a lot of problems the US seems to view as world policing are quite literally US foreign policy mistakes from the cold war. The Taliban for instance, and all those other fundamentalists. Iran's current regime is an unintended side effect of the Shah, etc, etc. Kind of of topic but there"
This is why South Korean government has been pursuing their own policy regarding North Korea recently. All because US has done absolute nothing to negotiate with NK while persisting sanction against them. Again and again with 'No negotiation until discarding nuclear weapon' has been going on for like... forever? We are so fucking sick and tired of US government stance on NK. And it really fucking bums out that South Koreans can't do much when it comes to NK issue all because US is so bull headed on sanctioning NK.
"> If N.K and South go to war again then U.S and U.N should be blamed

No they shouldn't. North Korea starves their people to death. It has concentration camps. It is a shitty regime backed by another regime that funnily enough also has ""reeducation"" camps."
"The sanctions are in place for a very good reason though.

They can't be lowered without NK cooperation."
"Haha, this guy thinks Trump fixes things"
Massive systematic violation of human rights. Living in North Korea is seen as the literal worst place on earth. Until information is allowed to flow in and out and oppression (at least slightly) dialled down I hope sanctions remain.
How is it unreasonable? Both parties offer something. It makes no sense for NK to unilaterally disarm themselves and hope they get treated well. That's the one bargaining chip they have and they're (understandably) not keen on losing it. For all they know they get invaded again the next day.
"Nukes is the only deterrent they have. Expecting a country to destroy the last ace up their sleeve is unreasonable as long as they don't have any other way to ensure their autonomy.

Imagine an army with reasons to seize your house is at your front door and demands you give up all your weapons so you may keep the house, pinky promise."
"They're unreasonable? Gaddafi gave up his nukes. He got a bayonet up his ass as a reward. Libya got so fucked up that slavery is back, there's a massive civil war, people are suffering and this has been going on for years.

If you want to encourage countries to give up their nukes, maybe don't fuck over the ones that do..."

There is no scenario where DPRK ""gives up"" its nuclear production. Here's one reason why:

>American planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea -- that is, essentially on North Korea --including 32,557 tons of napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of World War II.

"If I remember a video I watched, they don't carry firearms to prevent shootouts because physical altercations are common"
"Not really that surprising, that part of the border has been disputed for quite a while, to prevent too much of an escalation both countries only sent unarmed soldiers there.

But as that incident shows: Even unarmed soldiers can still kill, tho this still represents less of an escalation than the two sides openly shooting at each other."
"Generals on both sides have been telling them to just duke it with fists to get the tension out with less danger of it exploding into a mile wide shootout/hot war.

"Afaik, they have a treaty saying firearm in the area= declaration of war"
"they got this ultra nationalist government now... though i saw reports there were casualties on both sides, so the tit for tat is already done..maybe"
"India & China did this before in 1962, people kill each other all the time."
"Yeah I'm pretty sick of the ""omg 2020 so bad guys"" jokes. It feels a lot like 2016 when people absolutely lost their minds over every 80-year-old coked out actor or musician who died."

"And here I was wondering what ""propaganda"" was being sent, assuming that it was calls for the people to overthrow the government or something. And it's shit like that?  What is their goal?"
It’s doubtful they’ll want to start a war over the gifted shed.
"Maybe South Koreans can save a bundle of won , by not having to maintain the building?"
Possession is 9/10ths of the law.
"Sure and it's a big statement, but just a statement nonetheless. 

It was a very cheap building."
"Conan visited the diplomatic buildings that are literally on the border between the two countries, this was firmly on the North Korean side."
Wait did Kim Jong sun stay in vegetable mode? Or did NK reach a new level in r/outside and there’s a new leader?
"I was wondering if he was still MIA. I remember it being plastered everywhere a few months ago, but never hearing any resolution. Has he really still not been seen by anybody but state media since April?"
What do you mean no sign? He’s made several public appearances since everyone got hyped on his ‘disappearance’
We’ve always been at war with Eastasia
To be fair they are just as mental as the people who always assume WW3 has started whenever NK does their usual posturing.
Has he still not appeared yet since he vanished?
"It was his sister.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53060620"
His sister is currently gaining way more power than the world should be comfortable with. She's basically the Azula to Un's Zuko
"Officially he is, but his sister has way too much power. Something is suspicious."
How do you explain the fact that his sister is the one giving orders?
"Are we sure it’s not just old videos of him on TV? Doesn’t he usually just make general statements on TV?  This whole “he’s been seen on TV so obviously he’s still alive” is a bit weird to me without some additional verification. I mean, I did see a clip of Martin Luther King Jr making a speech on TV last week, but I’m pretty sure he’s not alive"
Kim dead. Sister wouldnt come out of nowhere leading the military and threatening countries if it werent true. US intelligence said Kim was dead months ago and I think Ill take their word for it
"NK : wants to talk 

NK : blows up a 14 million dollar building that’s supposed to be where we talk"
This thread is full of drama queens treating it like a reality TV show.
Remember when they melted the inside of a mountain with a nuke and no one gave a hoot? Good times.
I visited my brother South Korea in 2013. He was a tank platoon leader at the time in the DMZ. News reported missile testing which had me reasonably worried but every thing was business as usual with everyone I met. Nobody seemed worried.
"I was stationed in South Korea when both the ship was sank and the island was struck with mortar strikes, it was unreal to me how no one back hole even knew it happened.

As a soldier deployed there, we were convinced we were going to war twice."
"Ya but there’s so much more in play right now, it’s almost crystal clear Kim died and Kim Yo is in charge now and this is what she’s doing in her first months in power. She literally said there will be a “tragic end” to the building two days ago now it’s rumble, also said they’re going to the DMZ soon which means they aren’t playing around. This shit is real."
"Another month, another chance. This is only the half time show."
"I'm surprised Doomsday preppers hasn't been more in the limelight this year.  I feel like they should be all over social media and the news saying, ""We fucking told you so."""
"If that's the case, this simulated reality sucks. Someone up there fucked up the parameters.

Thank god we didn't have kids."
"It was basically a brand new building . Built in 2018, it had a little over a year in operation before it was shut down for COVID. NK likely would've blown it up in a temper tantrum long ago if it was older."
"Such as when they literally shelled a South Korean island? 


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardment_of_Yeonpyeong"
Yep. Paid entirely by the south just in North Korea. Kaesong isn't far. 18 millilon dollar building paid by tax payers. A 4 story building!
Well it's definitely smaller than blowing up a whole South Korean naval ship and killing dozens of soldiers on board.
It was paid by the South Koreans tax payer money
Kim Jong Azula
"He could also be incapacitated; maybe comatose (or put into a medically-induced coma by doctors) or in a vegetative state or something and Kim Yo-jong has assumed the reins of power until he either recovers or dies, and if he dies, then she's presumably the next North Korean leader. 

She'd be making these moves to show strength and get the military establishment on her side; she's never been officially named as Kim Jong-un's successor (to the best of my knowledge), so she needs to look like a hard-ass that's not to be trifled with."
So is she the de facto leader now or what?
They're all a bunch of spoiled children who throw a tantrum with missiles when they're not daddy's (U.S.) favorites.
Do we even know if he is still alive?
like throwing your toys out of the pram
In the long run though there is a chance it will greatly increase the economy and cooperation between the 2 though.
"The Koreas have been separate since 1945 right? I doubt there are many people alive that remember a time when they were the same country. Even the old generation in SK grew during the Cold War, likely fearing and hating NK."
"But an unified Korea would then have access to Nuclear weapon and ICBM, combine with SK current advancement in aircrafts, tanks etc... and suddenly unified Korea would be a big player in term of both military power and economy. And I doubt China would want that to happen on their backyard."
Whether it’s economically feasible or not it doesn’t matter because China is not going to allow the two Koreas to unite. China is a superpower and unlike ussr who collapsed and stopped support for East Germany china will prop up North Korea as their lappies and buffer against US - Korea led forces
"Too many BS in this thread parroting 'SK with don't want unification'.

Yet we have foreigners who keep on saying they are not interested because one of their Korean friend in US said so."
"I’m not weighing in on whether or not you’re right because I don’t know the prevailing opinion well. I have one South Korean friend from college but we never talked much about the situation. But surely you get the irony of criticizing people for believing the results of “some random survey” (don’t even know what survey you’re referring to) and then proceeding to expect them to believe some random dude on the internet, right?"
"Exactly. North Korea’s most valuable commodity is labor...I guess. South Korea has very little incentive to trade with them from my point of view. If there’s something I’m not seeing, someone enlighten me. Always willing to have my mind changed"
"Iran had a democratically elected government that the US overthrew with covert means and then installed a leader they liked.

So no, its not a ""side effect"" it was a very direct, but unintended, effect. Due to american ""world policing"". Aka believing that they have/had the right to decide what leaders control what countries."
"To be fair, we've done multiple things from trying to provide aid in the form of food to taking a hard-line stance.  Eventually they just start firing off nukes for testing again.

If you have any ideas, I'm sure others would like to hear them."
So what would you do?
Information is far easier to suppress in an impoverished nation. Fighting for your rights is also easier to do if you're better off economically
"That true, forgot that one, but that's something they maybe will talk about if the sanctions will be lifted."
"And even putting that aside, North Korea is not a unified block who listens to the divine will of Kim-Jong-Un as the propaganda would make it out. The man has to balance his internal politics and a lot of his foreign policy is partly because of domestic concerns. Full denuclearization would lead to him being couped and forced to commit suicide most likely."
Yeah but you probably electronically deposited it first.
Should've given it to someone who needed it
Too bad every single headline only mentions Indian casualties. Makes you wonder why...
"'Hey here's a shed!'

'FUCK YOUR SHED!!'

2. she is now in control and Kim Jong Un is dead"
"I wonder how they react if all country don't show any reaction.
No comment and No news and pretend super busy with corona."
Kim fucked off while Covid was in town or he died so he or his sisrer needs to look tough. When he/she gets aid he'll look tough and competent.
The boy who cried wolf comes into mind here.
How is it almost crystal clear that Kim Jong Un is dead? It couldn't be more unclear.

"She will have difficulty building up a power base unless she really mashes the pedal down to the floor. NK politics is very misogynistic and there is a cult built up around KJU as well as his father.

At one point it was understood by westerners that she would temporarily be the leader (regent) until KJU's male heir was old enough to assume power. Not much is known about his children for sure... he is assumed to have several and there likely is at least one male child, but no one knows for sure how old he would be."
Imagine him waking up to find his sister's actually managed to make things worse.
"Wait, he's still MIA?  I thought he appeared after the rumors started."
"I agree I was just joshing around lol he’s either incapped and finna croak soon enough, already dead, or possibly just dodging covid but that doesn’t seem realistic anymore with all this Kim Yo publicity."
"No, but she is high ranking, maybe getting groomed as the successor. If she says something, then itll get done, and itll have the approval of the supreme leader."
"I think she’s going to bare her teeth for a while, and then Kim is gonna make a come back. This way the world knows that he’s actually the good cop. It’s better for negotiations if your enemy thinks the alternative is a monster"

Seems odd that his sister is now calling shots if he is alive and well.
Also curious as to whatever happened to the whole Kim Jong Un being dead thing
"Even the two parts of Germany are still somewhat divided, after 40 years of division and 30 years since. 

Now imagine the struggle with this country that has been divided for 75 years and even more so than Germany has ever been."
"You’re right in someways, however you also have to think of those people’s children who likely grew up hearing stories of a unified Korea they never got to see. They would also be more likely to be for unification than the generation who either heard the stories second hand or never heard the stories"
"The disconnect usually happens when the people who witnessed it stopped being around. People born after the seperation still had parents who lived through it and shaped their view. The next generation still had grandparents to tell them. But the generation after that? Nope. It becomes less ""real"" with every generation."
"The topic of reunification is a complex one, with opinions highly influenced by recent events. When North-South Korea was at it's highest point of tensions for instance, then the topic of reunification wouldn't even be appropriate to bring out. But when the historic meetings between the two head of state occurred and a plan for a peaceful reunification was declared back in 2018, the approval rating of President Moon [skyrocketed up to 84%](http://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&Seq_Code=135988). I think that's showing of hopefulness of the general public when faced with a real possibility on a peaceful  reunification.

Still, this most recent provocation has definitely soured the public mood again, and now more Koreans could be against appeasement and even reunification. I definitely can't speak for everyone as the opinions are fractured - as it is for any other complex issue. I just found it heavily leaning to one side of the story on most comments I found on reddit.

Nevertheless, the [constitution of South Korea](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_service/lawView.do?hseq=1&lang=ENG) states the following:


>Article 3	: The territory of the Republic of Korea shall consist of the Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands.

> Article 4	: The Republic of Korea shall seek unification and shall formulate and carry out a policy of peaceful unification based on the basic free and democratic order.

So when faced with an opportunity to reunify, unexpected or otherwise, South Korea is constitutionally obligated to take in North Korea."

Or Libya. Would France and Britain dare to impose their no fly zone if Gaddafi have nukes? Nuke are the best deterrent there is for NK.
You get the BESSTTTTT of both worlds!
So what I'm hearing is China has immortal soldiers?
I Googled Ladakh and literally the first three results said casualties on both sides.
"5 Chinese casualties, 3 Indian"
"Because china hasn't confirmed anything (yet), which could also mean they have more casualties, want to ignore the incident or something else."
Is State Farm gonna cover her she shed?
"Well, no, but he's usually seen in places that are verifiable by third parties, outside of state media. From what I've read, the only proof he's still healthy and normal have come from photos that only the DPRK can substantiate."
Not the first time the internet has gone crazy over this kind of thing. Until I see better proof I'm going to assume he's still alive.
There were speculations about double.
And even if they were real (body double) I think that's the only appearance he's made since those rumors began.
What
haha fire nation go brrrrr
So filming a TV show about everything they have probably isn't the best idea then.
"Which is why I find it hilarious the number of people who build their bunkers in their back yards as their neighbors watch the whole process.  As if when society collapses and they are starving, they are just going to conveniently forgot that you are down there with 5 years of food, while they have nothing but time on their hands and a bunch of shovels."
"Yup they slowly back stepped out of the lime lite and into their underground bunkers, surrounded by their stash beans, band-aids, and bullets."
"""If you guys need me, I'll be out in my bunker 27 yards due south from the hose bib on the south-east corner of my garage. The key is definitely not under the mat beside the inconspicuous steel plate that no one would ever notice in the middle of the flower garden.

Got you guys so good!"""
"Everyone hates on MREs, but things like chicken teriyaki with the shortbread cookies were good af and I'd totally eat them every day after the apocalypse."
Nah we upgraded from MRE's long ago. Freeze dried bulk is where it's at now.
Most MREs aren't that bad. Some are pretty good. I know of several people who would take extra MREs home to snack on after field exercises.
They're still sitting on the toilet.
"Huh.  Well, it's time for me to get a new can opener, mine's crap.  So spill the beans, what's the prepper-approved model?  

And the trick is not just to live close to a hospital, but to be on the same grid segment so you get power restored first."
Doesn’t every sub eventually descend into can opener discussion?
"Society completely collapsing is not the most likely scenario.  You should prep for everything in between and have a bug out location.  Don't bug out if you don't have to, so your house should be in a good spot for the medium level scenarios."
"Prep for what you know. For example I live where there are somewhat frequent windstorms that cause power outages. I'm also house shopping so if a house has a backup generator that's a plus for me. Don't prep for stupid shit live a volcano erupting and blocking out the sun, at that point it's an extinction event and we are all dead and prepping won't help."
"I felt the same way after hurricane sandy hit. We were woefully unprepared. No flashlights, batteries, etc. but at least we had some food! Our power went out really early, before the storm even hit. We spent that night shuttered in our apartment, listening to the swirling winds, & metal shingles from surrounding buildings whipping around outside. Not to mention a tree fell on my car! We had some tarp or something that we wrapped around the back windshield that was blown out so it wouldn’t get waterlogged as well. And if all that wasn’t scary enough, the following day I went to our closest department store to pick up some supplies. (Cooler, ice, lamps, batteries, etc) nothing. The shelves were empty. No food, no coolers, no ice, no nothing. Ice was being delivered while I was there & I figured I’d come back in like 2 minutes, after looking for something else. That was a mistake, the ice never made it into the freezer, people scooped it up right from the delivery guy! Seeing that scene fresh off the excitement from the night before, I swore we’d never be unprepared like that again. We always have a supply of batteries & at least a weeks worth of shelf stable food at all times."
"Coming from Florida, the whole concept of being prepared when the proverbial shot hits the fan was something that was always taught to us. We tend to take it for granted but I was definitely reminded when I moved to California completely forgetting that the state likes to burst into flames every year. Now, a go-bag for everyone sits next to the door and several cans of petrol and other supplies sit ready to go at different points around my town."
"I always figured I’d stash a Bug Out Bag somewhere when I get my own place, but why not now? (probably cause the awkwardness if some disaster strikes and I only packed a bag of supplies for 1 person and the whole family is trying to get their hands on it)"
The reason for blowing this place up had absolutely nothing to do with the building's usefulness and everything to do with sabre rattling. This served literally no purpose other than to be a show of force and display of power.
It's about making a point.

That comes after her dad going on world conquest and her brother returning from exile.
"Definitely, she's going to need to be in charge of the money and she's definitely going to need North Korea's military establishment behind her, all those Generals with all those medals. The real power behind the throne."
"Yeah, that's not gonna happen in this case. The only time that happens is when its her own children. 

Kim Yo-jong will soon parade around those kids saluting her, until they are no longer convenient."
"So far, I haven't seen a personality cult being built around her, or if it is, it's in its infancy right now. You're right that she'd need to crank things up to 11 if she's going to be taken seriously by the North Korean establishment. 

It's really a weird dynastic situation in North Korea, which I find darkly humorous in what is ostensibly a Marxist country; the last time I read Karl Marx (well over 25 years ago), I don't recall him having much positive to say about dynastic monarchies."
How do you know this? Where’s the proof of this? The truth is that we don’t know anything about North Korea.
"Yeah, waking up, finding out what's going on and saying in his best Ricky Ricardo voice, ""Yo-jong, you got some 'splainin to do!!"""

Has Kim Jung Un been seen recently? I recall there was some concern or speculation over his health. Is that now behind us and he's been recently spotted back at the podium so to speak?
"So, yes?"
"He's alive, showed up for an event later."
"It is currently unknown with certainty whether he is alive and well, alive and ill, or has passed away.

He has not made any public appearances since the one at the factory opening that quelled the original death suspicions, which some analysts now believe may have been a body double.

Kim Yo-jong suddenly making so many political statements and taking leadership almost definitely means she is trying to prove herself to be fit for leading the nation one day, and the uncertainty of Kim Jong-un's state may mean that he is not fit to rule at the moment, and she is filling the power vacuum."
"Not only that, but for all of DDR's flaws (which were MANY, although they were not so much flaws as they were by design), it still wasn't as behind the Federal Republic as North Korea is when compared to South Korea. 

Add the oppression taken up to 11 and for even longer and the reunification seems nigh inmpossible."
"And the DDR was a lot more economical ""equal"" then NK is to SK."
And relatively speaking the divide between West and East Germany was basically nothing in comparison to NK and SK.
"I guess they do have deposits in the northern part of the country, but it’s expensive to extract since most of the terrain is pretty mountainous. For SK’s, it’d be cheaper to source from China or Africa, depending on what they’re looking for. Only way it’d be feasible was if SK was willing to allow the current labor practices in NK, which would receive a lot of backlash in the UN"
"It's not just 'don't forget the Brits', the Brits are the ones who wanted the coup in the first place."

"I'm still suspicious too, because I've only seen ONE photo from state media. No video, no proof it was recent, no other appearances confirmed by anyone outside of NK.

I'm not even one of those conspiracy theory type of people, but I will always have full distrust when it comes to these dictators. They need to provide more proof other than one still photograph."

Before long, we were working directly with Iranian intelligence, and they were providing the quality intel we needed and were the only ones who could. Bush destroyed that newfound cooperation when he labeled Iran as part of an ""Axis of Evil"" during the next State of The Union address. Iran rightfully cut off the intel and went right back to their public ""Death to America"" stance.

Obama, for all of his faults, started healing that rift a bit, and Trump merely undid that (which was stupid)."
One free unit every 30 seconds.
"Yeah... Like the guy that said he had these elaborate underground rooms and tunnels. He explained them like they were really there. The only thing you ever saw was a rusty, decrepit pile of shit. He was totally lying. I think he even convinced *himself* he had something beautiful down there. It was some buried shit from some war or something and he bought the property.

Edit: So I've been reminded by /u/KANNABULL that they were underground buses that were buried. He was just lying about how nice it was. It was just old rusty buses."

"Wouldn't that require access to an untainted groundwater source? Maybe I misunderstand the term ""self sustaining,"" but a hydroponics bay run outside of a closed system would naturally lose water over time to evaporation, if nothing else. And, unless you're in a biology lab or on a space station you're not working in a closed system."

Those both suck. The best can opener I've found is the one on my leatherman. Victorinox (company that makes swiss army knives and now other multi tools) can openers are decent but I don't dind them to be as efficient as my leatherman.

"Yeah, but when you consider Seoul is only 35 miles from the border and NK does have the very real capability to lob enough of those conventional explosives at it to be pretty devastating it's still a reminder to take somewhat seriously not to provoke them too much."

"Are you talking about the guy with the old bus tunnels? That's real, it's just not as imaginative or elaborate as he makes it sound. It's unstable and made out of 28 or so defunct school buses he bought from an auction. It's not even ten feet underground though, he totally stole the idea from Timothy Leary's buddy that created the LSD palace. Which actually is a maze of underground tunnels and concrete tubes from an abandoned missile bunker in Wamego, Kansas. I think his name was wicket or picket but he ended up creating the largest LSD manufacturing setup in those tubes, prior to the erowid and jolly Roger recipes he was one of four chemists on the planet in the 70s that knew how to create the original formula for lysergic diethylamide. Not the ergot pan trip the actual 80 step process of making safe LSD."

"Indoor hydroponics tend to be pretty close to closed.  There is no diversity like in a natural ecosystem, so when you get a pest invasion, they run rampant like nothing you have seen in your worst nightmare in your peeper victory garden in your back yard.

"To survive the apocalypse you really dont need to last very long hidden away, generally speaking a few weeks to maube a few months is long enough for most issues to have resolved themselves *or* for everyone who wasnt prepared to have died off and you can come out without much risk of getting robbed or attacked."
"This is the rabbit hole I started to get confused about. But the answer was around 4-5 can openers. The conversation was about using a can opener on a multi-kit / swedish knife. What the best can opener was. People said that regular can openers break, and I thought the p38 was a regular super duty can opener cuz everyone was saying how good it is. I’m looking it up now and it’s still some lil thing. 

But like I said you need 4-5... So? Idk that sub really confused me and I didn’t want to come off as rude so I didn’t really ask."
"Leathermans seem like they’d have the sturdiest base, that was the multikit I mentioned. I forgot the name leatherman but know there’s others. They didn’t seem as popular as the Pseries openers.

>Operation Paul Bunyan was carried out on August 21 at 07:00, three days after the killings. A convoy of 23 American and South Korean vehicles (""Task Force Vierra"", named after Lieutenant Colonel Victor S. Vierra, commander of the United States Army Support Group) drove into the JSA without any warning to the North Koreans, who had one observation post manned at that hour. In the vehicles were two eight-man teams of military engineers (from the 2nd Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division) equipped with chain saws to cut down the tree.

>These teams were accompanied by two 30-man security platoons from the Joint Security Force, who were armed with pistols and axe handles. The 1st Platoon secured the northern entrance to the JSA via the Bridge of No Return, while the 2nd Platoon secured the southern edge of the area.

>Concurrently, a team from B Company, commanded by Captain Walter Seifried, had activated the detonation systems for the charges on Freedom Bridge and had the 165mm main gun of the M728 combat engineer vehicle aimed mid-span to ensure that the bridge would fall should the order be given for its destruction. Also, B Company, supporting E Company (bridge), were building M4T6 rafts on the Imjin River should the situation require emergency evacuation by that route.

>In addition, a 64-man task force of the South Korean 1st Special Forces Brigade accompanied them, armed with clubs and trained in taekwondo, supposedly without firearms. However, once they parked their trucks near the Bridge of No Return, they started throwing out the sandbags that lined the truck bottoms, and handing out M16 rifles and M79 grenade launchers that had been concealed below.[3] Several of the commandos also had M18 Claymore mines strapped to their chests with the firing mechanism in their hands, and were shouting at the North Koreans to cross the bridge.[12][13]

>A U.S. infantry company in 20 utility helicopters and seven Cobra attack helicopters circled behind them. Behind these helicopters, B-52 Stratofortresses came from Guam escorted by U.S. F-4 Phantom IIs from Kunsan Air Base and South Korean F-5 and F-86 fighters were visible flying across the sky at high altitude. At Taegu Air Base, F-111 bombers of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, were stationed, and F-4C and -D Phantoms from the 18th TFW Kadena Air Base and Clark Air Base were also deployed. The aircraft carrier USS Midway task force had also been moved to a station just offshore.[5]

>Near the edges of the DMZ, many more heavily armed U.S. and South Korean infantry, artillery including the Second Battalion, 71st Air Defense Regiment armed with Improved Hawk missiles, and armor were waiting to back up the special operations team. Bases near the DMZ were prepared for demolition in the case of a military response. The defense condition (DEFCON) was elevated on order of General Stilwell, as recounted in Colonel De LaTeur's research paper later. In addition, 12,000 additional troops were ordered to Korea, including 1,800 Marines from Okinawa.[5] During the operation, nuclear-capable strategic bombers circled over the JSA.

>Altogether, Task Force Vierra consisted of 813 men: almost all of the men of the United States Army Support Group, of which the Joint Security Force was a part; a South Korean reconnaissance company; a South Korean Special Forces company which had infiltrated the river area by the bridge the night before; and members of a reinforced composite rifle company from the 9th Infantry Regiment. In addition to this force, every UNC force in the rest of South Korea was on battle alert.

Edit: Take what america did to the native americans and apply that to the whole world and you may get close to how fucked up what they did was.  Anywhere that was too established to destroy the native populations got enslaved instead."

"In his biography, [Total Recall](http://manoflabook.com/wp/book-review-total-recall-by-arnold-schwarzenegger/), /u/GovSchwarzenegger state that if California was a country it would be in the G7 economic summit."
California has roughly the same GDP as California lol

For the people **reporting** this **as a repost.** The original post was taken down for lack of compliance with Rule #3. [OP has now fixed this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ha20rx/oc_these_6_areas_in_the_us_have_roughly_the_same/fv01fjd/) and thus reposted.
"I'd be curious to see the region with NY, CT, PA, DE, MD, DC, and VA together, or GDP per capita. Love these kind of visualizations."
I pretty sure New England + New York is smaller and has less population than California. This may also be true for some of the other areas
"To be fair, that blue section would be roughly the same if it was exclusively Texas.

Edit:

Texas's GDP is $1,918,000

OK, KS, MO, AR, MS, LA combined is $1,240,000

Texas makes up 61% of that group."
"Important to remember is the GDP of these states isn't all on the same baseline.

For instance the median price of a house in California is over $615,000 while the average home in Texas is around $180,000. Selling the average house in CA would produce 3x the GDP effect as selling a house in TX but in the end its the same product."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_sovereign_states_by_GDP

CA could easily be it's own country."
"Is it possible to indicate the sources of the GDP for these regions?
(Such as, oil/gas, mining, manufacturing, farming, etc)"
"as someone who is colorblind, I had trouble telling what was what in the northeast"
"No surprise there. Lots of tech companies, Holywood, vineyards and lets not forget the porn industry. Still worth a ton, despite the crisis they've been in the past years."
"Beautiful! 

I'm seeing a lot of comments crediting the tech and entertainment industries and I have to put this out there: They are big money makers, yes, but agriculture is king. We provide over 90% of the world's almonds, 99% domestic peaches, figs, olives, dates, kiwis, and pistachios, and nearly 90% of domestic strawberries (with the lion's share from Oxnard alone).

California thrives due to its massive size that allows such diversity in leading industries and people. :)"
"Could group, NJ, PA, and NY together and it would exceed California's"
I didn't know a map had the power to trigger so many people.

"I’d wager in 10 years this looks very different. California is in a bubble. Many established tech companies are fleeing the state to be in more advantageous tax states and for cheaper office space. Places like Dallas and Austin TX are really booming right now. Wouldn’t be shocked to see TX as the tech capital in 10 years time.

Edit: I’m not anti-California. I realize my post reads like a right wing nut talking out of his ass while living in a fly over state. I’m not saying California will crumble or anything. 

It’s really all about tech companies at the end of the day. The only companies in the US with trillion dollar valuations are tech companies. They determine where the big money is now."
"Come on bro why shackle WV and KY to NJ? The I95 corridor DC Philly, north Jersey, NYC would be a more fair comparison to California. Edit: I get its a graphic but it irks me to look at that as a region lol"

>Oh my god California is so economically successful.

Yea, they haven’t had to worry about outdated infrastructure needing investment .... except for PG&E’s electrical grid."
Wonder how you selected the states for the other groupings. Did you spread outward from California until you'd matched GDP for the green zone? Then do crystal growth from the highest GDP states on the border of that zone?
"I believe it. Just amount of almond orchards that I saw on my road trip through Cali was crazy. So many crops, orchards, and wineries. Then all the attractions in all the different cities  is just mind blowing."
How much is the data skewed by Alphabet and Apple?

shocked when I learned California has a higher GDP than France and does it with millions of less people
I’d be interested to find out how much trade with the Asian markets impacts this.
CA is a huge coastal state and is a direct route to Asia. I wouldn’t expect anything different.
Surprised the north east is so small.
"Does this have a relation to as why California is so expensive? Which is tied into the high incomes? 

It seems as if essentially California has its own adjusted economy with high inflation."
Shouldn't all the GDP technically be in Delaware since that's where nearly all companies are registered?
Cool data. California’s so big though it really shouldn’t get so much credit. NY+New England is like half the size
If you added Mexico to Texas it would be about the same as Cali
What happens when we take out Hollywood?
Glad we have the electoral college. Give us that GDP! But your votes have the least amount of power.
"I’m OK with redoing Congress and the House based on this for one and population for the other.

If GDP is so important it should guide representation."
Makes the rampant homelessness there even more retarded
Florida has to be carrying the bulk of that for the southeast.
and aren't they still losing money?
How and why is California's GDP so high?
TX doing most of the heavy lifting in its area I would imagine.
They should each be one state. Would clear up some floor space in the Senate.
California’s also broke so...
"technically, california's ""GDP"" is worldwide..."
Surprised Texas needs so much support
"This dramatically understates the GDP of Texas, NY, and Florida, since those states do alllll the heavy lifting in their colors."
I wonder how much Texas New York and Florida add to their sections GDP?
I’d like to see the states grouped by gdp instead of geographical location.  I think seeing how many of the poorest states there are to compare to California and how few of the richest states compared to California would be interesting.
"Why gerrymander the northeast and midwest that way... why not just use the most efficient to reach around the number you are looking for? 

For example combining New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio would surpass California's GDP... but you split the three of them up."
"I think it's funny how much conservatives rail against california but california actually has all the power in the relationship. If california left to become its own country the united states would be exponentially worse off. California grows a lot of food, it could easily be self-sustainable and its GDP rivals most other countries."
"So when are California’s progressive polices going to reduce their income gap, deliver affordable housing, and stop having a mass exodus out of their state?

Liberals haven’t specified how long it takes. As of now California is proving heavy regulations help the rich get richer while the normal people get priced out of living."
"Random tangent because I often hear about how California is carrying the rest of the nation with their economy and jokes about how California should break off into their own country and be better off. The Californian GDP is only that high because of federal subsidy and other states supporting them.

Its a lot like praising only the lead singer rockstar, and ignoring the rest of the band, or the sound crews, or the bus and truck drivers etc etc etc. the whole institution and apparatus that supports their success and makes it possible.

Anyway not related to your post much but thats what it made me think of."
Now do adjusted for prices. Let's see.
Yaaaaawn. California used to be paradise. It still is if you can afford Malibu or Brentwood. Lol.
And this is why the electoral college format is bullshit.
"Why does the massive amount of money flowing through Wall Street not make NY's GDP larger?

I know I could read through the data and figure this out but please humor me."
"Although, in the area with Texas and the area with florida, I'm sure most of the economy is coming just from those states in a similar way."
Now let's see spending vs GDP. *watches California eat itself*
is it because hollywood makes so much money and is in california?
"Thank you for pointing it out, I felt like I was taking crazy pills that the GDP of the whole country was apparently less than Bezos’ bank account"
"Cali ranks 5th, behind DC, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut"
"Agreed!  That would very much change things.  One thing interesting about the US though is that while the mean per capita income is quite high, the mode is surprisingly low.  The average is skewed by a lot of mega outliers.  IIRC, our mean is one of the highest in the world, while our mode is approximately the poverty line."
DC is so far out there per capita. Must be something to do with that capitalism / politics relationship...
"Do it!

Also California just like every state in USA does it with millions of less people. USA is amazing effective"
"Just off the rough populations I remember it would go

1.new york+,New England

2.california 

3.west+plains

4.Mid Atlantic+ Appalachia

5.Western South 

6.Easter south"
"Why? What would that change?

The point here is that California is a principal economics engine of the country.

What they should really do is emphasize that NY, CA, TX, and FL with honorable mention from IL and WA power this country."
California is still towards the top. Red states are very much towards the bottom. Next.
"And let's see it with the entertainment industry removed. The Midwest produces things the country needs to survive, not leisure activities.

EDIT: Butthurt Californians throwing me some Downvotes. I know your state is the largest agriculture producer in the country, I just want to see how different this chart looks when you exclude the entertainment industry from it."
"At least partially due to Brexit, we surpassed the UK for the number 5 spot globally."
"California's $3.2T annual GDP dwarfs Canada's $1.7T annual GDP, despite our roughly equal populations and Canada's vast natural resources. 

I love my home Canada, but it is hard not being impressed with California's economic output."
Well that link just made my virus scanner go mental. Site is compromised
If it were a country all those other states wouldn’t be doing their business in it and it’s gdp would be lower.
I believe Texas would be to if I remember correctly.
Big FACTS
Did you know Texas is bigger than Texas?
"If you breakup the US into the regions they suggest: Northeast, South, Midwest, West the GDP’s would be 5, 3, 6, 2 in the world and the populations are roughly equal if I remember correctly. (Like 70 - 90m range)

Which is kind of cool that the US is like 4 G7 economies in one union."
"Woah woah. Why would you leave out NJ if you're including PA, NY, DE which surrounds NJ. Lol"

I can't do the fancy visualizations, but I found this chart to be pretty interesting myself. Used the same Wiki article as OP.

Edit: I guess I could use the same map viewer OP did, but I have to go back to work. This took me longer than I'd like to admit."
"Exactly. Surprise, the most populous and one of the largest states has the most GDP!"
"I wonder if this is a optimal (minimum groups) grouping. I can’t help but think that if you you compared the costal stretch of NY to VA you would at least have a single smaller group that is the same GDP. NY alone is nearly 50% of CA GDP. PA, VA, MD, NJ is roughly another 50%.

And it almost gets you to question gerrymandering without being about gerrymandering."
It certainly looks like it could be a smaller total land size
"61% is not roughly the same tho, but nonetheless interesting fact"
I was looking for this. I was wondering how much it would have changed if Texas was left out.
"OK, KS, MO, AR, MA, LA have roughly 23,647,000 people combined 

TX has 28,995,000. 

So the combined states make up 81% of the population of TX, and I guess the 20% difference could be due to larger companies headquartering in Texas for preferable location to others. Texas is also home to energy corridor and the energy exports ($268B) alone make up an entire state and a half lol. 

This stuff is all super fun to look at and compare."
"Yeah also, consider this.  NY = 1.5 T, PA = 728 B, NJ = 581 B, MA = 508 B, together they have about the same area and similar GDP to CA.  Whoever made this intentionally lumped in low GDP density areas with higher GDP density areas to make their point stronger."
"61% does not equal 100%

Those Texas schools really are something"
"Or just put California, Texas, and New York together against the other 47.  There are plenty of ways you can slice it."
Do we need to be fair?
"A point of clarification, only new construction is included in GDP."
"Houses are same product, land is not"
"It's not the same product, because a house in CA is obviously much more desirable and therefore worth a lot more. A house's value isn't just four walls and a roof, it's also its location."
This is nonsense. Resale of existing properties do not count towards GDP. Stop spreading misinformation.
"To put it another way, it would be nice to see a ""cost of living"" adjustment. Or what is it called ""consumer price parity?"" adjustment. A gallon of gas is more expensive in CA, a beer in a restaurant is more expensive in CA. Certainly, these things don't have intrinsically higher value due to location."
"I got one.

* My house is 4 bedroom, 2400 sq ft, on 3/4 acre for about $270k.15 min from work.
* A friend of mine just moved to Seattle from where I live.  2 Bedroom house capital hill area with garage (notable because it drives the cost some).  No lot to speak of.  Modern house, nice area.  1.2 million."
Every state in the union could be its own country. The smallest gdp state (Vermont) is still a bigger gdp than 95 countries on that list.
"For those like me looking for per capita state rankings:

Some real stunners in the top 10. A lot of fracking money it appears. And Delaware!

Washington state too."
"I love it when people look at a State’s performance *within the framework of the Union it belongs to* and declare that it ‘could easily be its own country.’ 

Of course it *could* be its own country. That’s true of every single state in the US. I’m guessing what you really mean is some version of ‘California doesn’t need the rest of the US.’ 

But you’re forgetting about the many, many economic benefits that California enjoys by its membership in the Union. If tomorrow California declares itself an independent nation the quality of life and economic output would drop."
"Sadly, there are those in our government short-sighted enough to want that to happen."
The individual wiki pages for each state's GDP have that usually.  [Here's the graphic for California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_California#/media/File:California_GDP_by_sector_2017.png)

"I mean growth of Tech in other places may have to do with tech being a larger sector in general. Can't really squeeze more companies there right now. So it might not be fleeing from Cali, more like tech growth in general has to have room to grow."
Austin grew so quickly that their infrastructure is struggling to support it. The 183 is fun during rush hour.
So many people have moved from California to Dallas-Fort Worth in recent years that the California transplant is a meme here.
">California is in a bubble. Many established tech companies are fleeing the state to be in more advantageous tax states and for cheaper office space. 

I'd have to agree. I recently had a job opportunity pop up in CA, and the pay range was about 40% higher than what I'm making in FL. I started looking into the cost of living differences, and it would have still been a substantial pay cut. Those kind of salary disparities go directly to the bottom line, and will start to force businesses to make decisions to mitigate. 

I've considered Dallas too (I have a couple of good friends in the financial sector there), and taking a job there at my current salary would actually feel like a significant increase because of housing."
"The reason CA is the tech capital is the UC and CSU systems. Moreover, they tend to be tolerant of foreign students. Meaning, they take in the best students from around the world. 

Also, the best and brightest minds that are pushing the envelope don’t want to live in Austin. The location of California just had more to offer. In CA you could snowboard and go to the beach in the same day. It’s a pretty crazy location."
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Prairie
According to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_California#/media/File:California_GDP_by_sector_2017.png) the California economy is definitely not only about tech
Are you just completely forgetting that California produces a fucking ludicrous amount of food that other states and the entire world eat?
"You're anti California. Tech is one aspect of our booming economy, but I bet you can't name the top 10 tech companies off the top your head in this state. It isn't all social media or internet companies, there's also some biotech companies. 

More importantly, California just has a lot of industry here. It's the volume of the amount of businesses not the size. If one tech company leaves, then another 5 start ups around the corner. There's also our potential to increase our trade with China."
It's because he needed some low income places to balance out the high earners.

"Well ""support"" is a generous word. Most of their support states are the poorest in the country"
"It's actually the second largest gdp in the nation, the other states in the color group are about half of Texas' gdp combined."
Not entirely true for Florida. North Carolina and Georgia combined GDP is more than Florida's.
New York alone accounts for 8% of the nation’s GDP.
">**Florida GDP** was $815,073,000,000 in 2016 according to BEA data. **Florida GDP** represents 4.99% of US **GDP** which made it the 4th largest state economy in the nation in 2016."
"Ish. What you're saying is a gross oversimplification much like the people saying Brexit was going to save the UK money, without taking into account individual actions.

If Cali was to leave, the majority of companies based in Cali would also seriously consider leaving, because if they stay they're now international companies operating in the US and not domestic companies and they would see a pretty substantial increase in tax burden.

Another big point is that California is EXTREMELY (50% of all water used in California) dependent on water artificially diverted from the Colorado River. To the point where it's a major contention between states in that region, pretty much every year. If California left the US, it would no longer be in US interests to artificially divert that water for free. So California would either have to pay through the nose or watch as it's agricultural regions dry up and cities dehydrate.

Considering water alone, California being independent is laughable at best."
"People rail against california because a lot of their policies are insane. People have continued to leave california in greater numbers than have moved there. Meanwhile, their income inequality gap has grown considerably and is 6th in the nation. Their homeless population continues to climb, even while other states are showing declines.

California does have a lot to offer, its absolutely beautiful and has biodiversity that isn't really replicated anywhere in the world. But lets not pretend that California has all the power. I'm sure Texas would appreciate it if California would secede so they could regulate how many people bring their politics with them when they move."
"If California left, there would be massive food shortages for the United States."
"It has 40 million people so it’s doesn’t seem that fair. Just cause California has money doesn’t mean it has everything it needs to be it’s own country. US will be fine without it but California would need to develop a military, farming, and form new relationships with government."
"We'll be fine, especially when their lights go dark because 32% of their power is imported."
California isn’t leaving
"It's fun how we point and laugh at brexiters while californians aren't shamed for writing this kind of fanfics.

Unless you go full best Korea and nationalize all the industry a lot of companies would leave because they wouldn't like to be treated by the US as foreign based, it would have to be a very very peaceful independence where both parties agree because if not you wouldn't have any deals with EU or China because China doesn't recognise any separatist movement, France and Spain either."
"The premises of your argument are interesting. 
General knowledge seems to be that many are leaving the state, but when compared with birth rate, that exodus seems negligible and perhaps acceptable for the financial demands of living there.
General knowledge seems to indubitably indicate there are cost of living issues. 
The two points that seem to be directly related would be interesting to see more data in: what progressive policies aim to reduce income gap and how is the regulation system making the rich richer.
The rich are always getting richer it seems, going back to 1929 if not longer....so....hmmm."
"Sources please, because pretty much all available data says that California gets less than it pays to the federal government, or it's about even."
"I could see an argument for amount received in defense spending maybe, but again sources would be needed."
GDP is just GDP and doesn't really have anything to do with cost of living expenses. You wouldn't use GDP for that. PPP is closer to what you're after.
California is a lot bigger than that.

We want numbers!
"That’s why when we talk about income, median is used. And GDP doesn’t apply per individual really so there is no median for individuals of GDP. GDP per capita then is the average total dollar value generated by each person in the country."
"> One thing interesting about the US though is that while the mean per capita income is quite high, the mode is surprisingly low.

Why is this interesting about the US? Are there any nation-sized examples where the mode income would be higher than the mean? 

I imagine nearly all economies look more or less like Pareto distributions, and hardly any look like the inverse of that. Am I way off base here? 

>while our mode is approximately the poverty line.

If this is more what you meant by intersting, I guess it's more about where the line is drawn. How does that compare to global poverty? Does drawing that line benefit or hurt the people at/under it?

Just my 2cents."
"If you're talking about individual earnings, sure. The modal income is zero, because only about half of individuals are employed. That's not very interesting."
"Mode would basically be minimum wage, since the economy is bottom-heavy - right?

Really I'm curious what the median is if you lop-off the top and bottom 2%"
"The median income is also quite high, [6th in the world](https://i.imgur.com/DVUBxYg.jpg). [source](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/median-income-by-country/)

The median wealth per adult happens to be the [highest in the world](https://i.imgur.com/72t5fTB.jpg). [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult)"
"Mode is the absolute worst form of measurement for this. You could have 5 people earning $10/year and 1,000,000 people earning between 1M and 2M a year with a $1 difference between each of their wages and the mode would be $10/year.

When you have a regulated minimum wage, of course whatever the most common minimum wage is throughout the states is going to be the mode."
check out this 6:23 minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM&t=7s) for a nice presentation.
"Do you have a reference supporting that the mode is at the poverty line? The US median GDP per capita is fourth in the world.

https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2016/05/giving-and-global-inequality/"
"It’s worth noting that the median for full time employees is right at $40,000 a year. Including part time employees can also skew things due to working students who aren’t trying to live completely off their earnings, though ignoring that stat can also somewhat hide underemployed people. 


Just some context."
"Income is higher in cities than smaller towns, and DC is the only data point that encompasses just a city, not a large geographic area."
"Or it has something to do with the fact that DC is the most educated city in the United States with over 1/3 of the population having an advanced degree and the fact that it encompasses no poor rural areas and is *just* an urban area with very high land values.

Or maybe you’re right and it’s all a huge conspiracy."
"In most countries the capital is an outlier in respect of GDP per capita (especially in countries where the capital is extremely small compared to the country itself). 

Paris' GDP per capita is more than twice that of France, and that of the City of London is more than 5x that of the UK.

The fact that these subnational divisions often have large amount of commuters significantly inflate the GDP per capita."
It also has one of the highest ratios of educated/uneducated people
"It's more so the fact that it's an urban city that's being compared to states, which skews essentially all ""per capita"" measurements when DC is compared to states."
It's not really unique to capitalism that wealth and power are concentrated around the primary political nexus of the state. I'm pretty sure that the wealth of those living around Kremlin in USSR was vastly higher the national average.
"Or a single city versus a whole state. Or it being the most educated city in the US. Or that millions of commuters work in DC and contribute to the GDP while not being a ""per capita""."
"I've found that people in r/dataisbeautiful are generally too obsessed with ""per capita"" measurements. While yes, they are very informative in lots of situations, people here pretend like non-per capita measurements are completely useless, when that simply is not the case. Non-per capita measurements simply tell a different, often completely valid, story."
"I wasn't trying to make this a red vs. blue thing, I'm genuinely interested in seeing the same data per capita."
"California is also the largest agriculture exporter of the US states, at $44.7 billion.  Second is Iowa at $31.9 billion."
Considering that California produces almost 50% more value in food than #2 (Iowa) and almost double #3 (Nebraska) that's a pretty dumb take based solely on the fact that you don't value an industry.
"GBP's exchange rate has also been dropping for a while now (with Brexit as a major reason behind that as well), which does create a more complex picture."
"I believe the vastness of our country works to our detriment. 

What I find interesting is, despite this - we are one of the largest GDP in the world. I guess it helps to have the US as our neighbour to trade with."
There are more important things than wringing your natural resources for all they're worth which Canada arguably does better.
"CA really needs to be two states. LA and SF are as different as NY and BOS, yet they are further apart.

IMHO, all of the states should have their borders re-drawn based on how business and populations tend to interact and flow, and how cultures mix naturally around nexuses like cities and natural features rather than historical accident.

AI might be the right tool to help, here. I'm certain that a machine learning model could be developed that would identify the interdependence of various communities and show where natural ""faults"" exist without separating communities from infrastructure and wealth that sustains them."

I’m honestly surprised that Texas is grouped with so many other states. I wonder what it’s GDP is by itself.
It'd be just outside the G7. Texas sits between 7th (either France or Britain at any given time) and 8th (Italy) at the moment
But is it faster than itself?
If it keeps eating whataburger everyday it sure will be.
Everything's bigger in Texas. All of Texas exists within Texas. Therefore Texas must be bigger than Texas.

"Desirability is a bit of a misnomer. Is it desirable because it's a bigger or nicer house or in a nicer area, or is it that the relationship between population and living space creates higher prices?

My house is 5 bedroom on an acre of land 15 minutes from my job. It costs ~$350,000. An old girlfriend of mine from California lives in a row house in Orange County with three bedrooms and one bath, no AC or laundry, a ""lawn"" of green cement, with her dad having over an hour and a half commute to & from work. Their house costs ~$500,000. Her family house is not a desirable as mine, yet it costs more simply because of the lack of available real estate.

"Sheer size & volume, good fortune with fertile soil, and honing in on cash crops. We also have to take history into consideration.

"Right, and that is why this is interesting.  Because we have a vanishingly small amount of folks earning the vast majority of income."
You mean we specifically use median because we don't want to address how poor the average(mode) American is.
"To be clear, it would be 'the mode of those earning some kind of income'.  We wouldn't want to include children and the extreme elderly."
"Also, mode is going to capture children and retirees who may not have an income but are not necessarily living in poverty, either."
"Mode, of course, would not be higher than median.  The idea here is that we have a handful of people that earn inconceivable amounts which makes our average look good but when you look at what the majority of people earn, it's not so rosy.

Keep in mind poverty is 'relative'.  Earning a poverty level income in the US, \~12,500/year would be a great income in many other countries.  Here, not so much.

Hypothetical example just for illustrative purposes.  You have a population of 100 people.  99 earn $10,000/year.  1 earns $1B/year.  The average income for this population is $10,009,000/year.  Looks like a very wealthy population!  However, 99% of these folks live below the poverty line.  This is basically what's going on with the US which is why it's important to look at the modal income, not just the mean."
Why would you remove the outliers if you are checking the median? Isn't the point of the median that extreme outliers won't skew it?
2.1% of workers in the US earn minimum wage.
I think mode would be essentially zero thanks to those stupid child labor laws.
"More pertinent, would be if you just lopped off the top 1% and left he bottom intact,  as that is whats skewing things."
"Did you sort by continents?

"The point being made is that the 'mean income' and 'mean wealth' are misleading.  Mean is the average, and because we have a small amount of people earning basically more than the GDP of entire countries, it makes our average look really high, whereas the mode (what the majority of people actually make) is approximately the poverty line."
"Cost of living is also higher so the overall ""wealth"" is usually somewhat misrepresented."
I'm not saying it's a huge conspiracy. I'm implying it has something to do with politicians being corrupt and taking money.

"You clearly have the better situation than living in the house you reference in California, but I think the above commenter means that there is more demand for houses in that area, driving the prices up thus making them more “desirable”."
u/Adamsoski is correct in that the more expensive house is more desirable.
"It doesn't really matter why a house is worth more, it's worth more because it is valued more - whether that is because more people want it or because of its facilities. Her house is de facto more desirable because people are willing to pay more. Location is pretty inarguably the most important aspect in a house's desirability."
It's more desirable because of the location
"Sure your house is far nicer. Her house is more expensive because it's more desirable. Turns out people value living in California far more than your 5-bedroom house in Texas near work. Her house is not more desirable to you, but it is the more desirable in the market, which is really what matters."
"Uh yeah, your ex lives in orange county. One of themost fun and diverse places to live in America. You probably live in the middle of nowhere."
">Some parts of California are nice, but it's not 3x desirable as Texas.

There is no way to objectively measure how ""desirable"" a place is outside of market demand so if a property is selling for 3x the price it is elsewhere, that's usually a good indication the property is in a much more disreable location. Anything outside of that is purely subjective."
"If someone values it at x3 then it is exactly 3x as desirable as that house in Texas. Maybe not for you, but apparently so for the market which is a better approximation of consensus value than anything else."
"Right, that makes the houses even more desirable. Because there aren't as many to go around."
"> Some parts of California are nice, but it's not 3x desirable as Texas.

"[Here's a very boring answer.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/304869/california-real-gdp-by-industry/) People want to live in California, so housing is expensive, which means that sector contributes a lot to GDP.

"Mode is just the most common value, it doesn't necessarily reflect the average American. I think you're confusing it with mean vs median."
You’re joking right?

"but even with unemployment, if you have 5% unemployment thats 5% of people with 0

"What about single income households?  If I've learned one thing from HGTV, it's that there's a lot of part-time teacher's assistants supporting a family of four buying $750,000 houses all over the US."
Typically income metrics only count people in the labour force so I don't think retirees and children would he counted.
"Mode tells you almost nothing. If you have 2 people earning $0, and the other 98 are evenly distributed earning between $500k-1M, the mode is $0. If two people are earning $1M, and everyone else is evenly distributed between $0-$100, the mode is $1M. What you want to look at is the median, which is the point at which half of people are earning more, and half the people are earning less."
"In your example, the median would be $10,000 per year, which would be the same as the mode. This is why median is used for income statistics, and not average (arithmetic mean). Median is not susceptible to outliers, and does not have the problem you are describing. You may want to take a look at [this link](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/mean-median-basics/a/mean-median-and-mode-review)."
What would you think the modal income is?
"Yeah if you remove the top and bottom, you'll still get the exact same median. 

Maybe he meant mean. The top will definitely skew that heavily."
It is indeed the point. Lopping off any equal amount of samples from both ends of the distribution is not going to have any effect on the median.
This is why I prefer weighted averages.
"You are correct. You could, on the other hand, take the average (e.g. GDP per capita) and remove the poorest and richest 1 %. This way outliners (mostly towards the upper end) will be less impacting your result (because you remove the billionaires). The problem is, how do you justify 1%? Why not 0.1 or 2%? This decision would be arbitrary. You could additionally to the GDP per capita look at the GINI coefficient or SD of your data. At least that's my idea on this."
"Yea, I think the guy was thinking about mean rather than median.


Although, the idea with the mean is that outliers on both sides should still average out.

I would call unskilled workers making minimum wage outliers on the lower end. They are more abundant than the top 1% so, overall I think they cancel out reasonably well. Which is why the mean income in the US is pretty much smack dab in the middle class. Slightly on the lower end if you consider a single earner family but, a bit more on the higher end if you consider a dual earner family."
"Earn *federal* minimum wage. That's an important distinction, since it hasn't been changed in over a decade and even most republican states have higher minimum wages."
Wealth isn’t the same as income
"You need to look up your definitions.  Mean is the average, median is the middle value, mode is the most common value."
"Median is not the average.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median

In statistics and probability theory, a median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as ""the middle"" value. For example, the basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the ""average"") is that it is not skewed so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a ""typical"" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets, which vary greatly, the mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a ""typical"" income is. Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result."
"You're thinking of mean, not median.

mean = average

median = middle

Median is resistant to such outliers as Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, etc."
"The mode doesn’t tell us much. It’s the MEDIAN that is the more important metric. No one worth anything ever used mean/average alone because that‘s obviously flawed. 

A good way to remember this: “Bill Gates walks into a bar, and the mean wealth increases to $1B, while the median wealth remains (mostly) the same”."
"You have near zero understanding of statistics. Just stop. Mode is inherently useless. MOde just gives you the singular value that the *plurality* (not majority) of people make. 

According to mode someone making $60,000 and $60,001 do not make the same amount. So if you had 7 people who made $0, $0, $100,000, $100,001, $500,000, $500,001, $500,002, the mode would still be $0.

Mode will always be the minimum wage because that is the one wage point that is fixed by the government, so cannot vary at all."
Which is a consequence of being just the city. Its cost of living is lower than other cities like SF and NYC.
"Would corrupt politicians taking money increase the gdp significantly? Or lobbying dollars spent on campaigns and such?

I mean, the federal government is certainly a massive entity and a huge portion of DC jobs are either directly for the government or for companies contracting with the government. But that is a bit different than what I think you're suggesting."
"It may be slightly that, but it is far and away that the statistical boundaries encompass only a city.   To prove it to you, Boulder, CO has about the same per capita GDP as DC."
"It's illegal for companies to just deposit money in politician's bank accounts. They can pay lobbyists to argue for legislation they like, they can donate (limited amounts) to politicians' campaigns, or they can set up their own political advocacy groups. 

DC has high education levels, and there are lots of high paying defense contractor jobs, big law firms, and that kind of thing. So I assume it is related to the fact that the national government is there, but it's not like illegal bribes are driving up the GDP of the DC metro area."

There is nothing behind those definitions anymore, but people use those in their daily lingo."
I think they meant the chart
"I understand the point they were making. The issue with it is the price isn't higher because it's more desirable, it's higher because it's more in demand. It might not sound like there's a difference between desire and demand, but it's important to remember that demand measures a quantitative need while desire measures qualitative wants.

The two houses in this case are objectively different, like you said the living situation is better in my case. But the numerical demand raises the price of housing that people end up paying far more and getting far less out of it."
"no kidding. in the OC, she's probably at most 20-30 minutes away from the beach with amazing year round weather. not to mention all those kushy jobs."
location is the primary driver of real estate value.  Supply and Demand.
orange county is 60% white and 1.7% black. And a lot of people prefer space and being able to have land over being cramped into small lots in a suburb like atmosphere.
"A lack of supply is not the same as an increase of demand. It may have the same effect.  Demand in orange county and Houston Texas may be exactly the same, but the difference in  supply can create a massive difference in price."
"Right, but don't those two things make moving to Texas more desirable?"

"> Disposable income is total personal income minus personal current taxes

Americans have lower taxes because most necessities are privatized. For example, Americans pay twice as much for healthcare as Canadians- but that still counts as disposable income."
"But our disposable income has to cover medical expenses, the cost of college, nursing homes for our elderly etc so it's not nearly as disposable as that in many of those countries."
"This is really interesting. I would be curious how this would look relative to the local buying power in their currency. I think that would some countries up the list a bit (maybe Canada and Korea, possibly Australia?) and some down (Ireland and Switzerland?)."
"Again, you are talking about median.  The point being made is that this number is misleading because we are outrageously extreme outliers.  When you have a population where the majority earn poverty level income but you throw in a few billionaires, the average looks great, while the mode shows the reality for most."
"Yeah all this free disposable money to cover expenses that are covered in other developed countries (child care, healthcare, school, etc.)."
"On mobile and pooping, so I only found a quick source. [According to this](https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2018-update/), the top 10% earn nearly 50% of the income"
The US has the highest income *and* wealth disparity in the developed world. You can't just deny facts because you don't like the sound of them.
3 people in America have more saved wealth than the bottom half of the country- more than 180 000 000 people combined. How do you think it got that way lol
"The most common value is right around the poverty line(28k-34k/year) That is mode. The median is about $42k/year, and that's becuase of outlier billionaires.

Im not sure if you're implying I'm wrong about that stat or if I'm not communicating properly.

(Edit: added the stats)"
Also the unemployment rate is not a real number of unemployed Americans... it only includes those that have worked or looked for work in the past couple weeks... there are many more unemployed Americans than the unemployment rate implies.
"Not necessarily cause 2% of the top could be 10 people while 2% of the bottom could be 10,000 people which would provide a different sample to the original"
"I think it depends on how you define what you lop off. If you mean out of 100 people you take the middle 96 then yes you are right. 

But if you say your total GDP is $100 so you want to remove the top 2 dollars of earners and the bottom 2 dollars of earners, but the top is 5 people and the bottom is 100 people then your median shifts.

Like I sometimes say, there are lies, damn lies and then there's statistics."
"In this case, the mode may well be the most revealing."
Unless you lop off 50% from each side :)
"Since the OP talked about minimum wage in the context of the US, I assume he was referring to the federal minimum wage. The mode is one value."
Good point. Thanks
"Canada has been taking in an immense amount of immigrants, because their society would not be otherwise sustainable. More than 20% of Canada's residents were born abroad, I do not think there is a large country with similar percentages (maybe some EU countries, but moving around here is much easier)."
"I agree on the first part, except Canadians don't value small town vibe as much as they're so few and spread out that they only have a bunch of small towns (with a few big cities >6 hour drives apart).  Source: Am Canadian-American

Edit: After rereading what you wrote and what I wrote, I guess we're saying the same thing except for the cause-effect relationship is reversed."
"First world and third world changed definition many years ago, as many words do. 

Nowadays first world is associated with wealthy countries not necessarily aligned to the US (Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and Sweden would all be first world) while third world is associated with poor, developing, or not developing countries, even if they did not pick a side between the US and the USSR during the cold war."
"First- and third-world have referred to levels of economic development for a long time.  Claiming some archaic, prescriptive definition when everyone knows what is meant isn't making the world a better place.

Also, second-world referred to Soviet-aligned countries.  Third-world referred to countries aligned with neither side, typically because they weren't valuable enough for either to care about, hence the moniker."

"But demand is driven in part by desire, also you can't really only partially include geographic proximity in your analysis, for example you noted that you were 15 min. from your office but none of the things that were close to your friend's house. I'd agree that in terms of actual dimensions your not getting the most desirous dimensions in CA or NY, but once you've thrown in proximity its a much harder calculation"
Well that may be your opinion but your opinion is clearly not shared by most. The good news is that you get cheap housing you like!
With the direction companies are moving in I think with mass work from home we’ll see a move from the cities to the middle of nowhere.
enjoy texas!
"I agree with you that I prefer space as well, but it's very obvious that a lot of people prefer living in orange county over anywhere else, otherwise prices wouldn't be so high there. The fact that it is shows that it is extremely desirable to a lot of people."
"1: What does race have to do with anything? It's like  40% Caucasian, 21% Asian and 34% Hispanic as well... A minority majority like most of the major cities.

2: Obviously not or more people would live in rural areas. Suburban and urban people make up like 80% of the population."
"And a lot of people don't. I'd rather live in a studio in a major city then a house in the middle of no where.

Also you might as well check the racial demographics for all of LA. Don't even know why you brought that shit up"
"Yes, but both factor into a house's desirability/value."
"Its highly efficient to the population as whole, but to many individuals its highly in-efficient. Personal transportation and mass transportation need to co-exist. Maybe the balance isn't quite right but its not clear cut. There are a lot of downsides to public transportation and I think a lot of people in the US have a 'grass is greener' view of the situation. Even when mass transit is available many people choose to use personal transit instead."
Fun fact some Texans call Austin “Little California”.
I am not American.
"3.5k will cover your healthcare for a year in the states if you pay no deductibles the whole year. At least, thats what my college is billing me for my health insurance plan. Once you start actually ""using benefits"" (i.e. getting healthcare) you have to pay 20% as well as whatever copays (flat charges for treatment) you agreed to in the plan. 

Go to the wrong doctor/hospital? Now you have to pay 100%. 

Go to the right hospital but the wrong doctor treats you? Still 100% out of your pocket.

Ambulance ride because you had an emergency medical instance? Should've bootstrapped togetheran uber ride to the hospital, cause that'll be a thousand dollars.

It might not seem like a huge cost initally, but it leaves people scared to actually seek treatment because it will bankrupt them."
"For 3.5 k you would basically get slightly better then disaster insurance. My friend just signed up for insurance for 220 dollars a month or so, and there are some preventive things that are included...basically a physical per year....but other then that he would have to pay about 8k dollars of his own bills before insurance really kicks in and covers anything...so he will spend about 2.5k if he never uses his insurance for anything major, but will pay 10.5k if say he gets in a car accident or something and needs surgery. Then it restarts the following year."
"I'll post it again:

Of the two countries above the US, Switzerland (I live there) does not have free healthcare, free nursing homes, or free college.

Norway is an extreme outlier due to oil, ~~but their health expenditures per capita are, according to the WB, higher than those of Americans (I think they are the only country in the world).~~

But the point was not what is the disposable income used for; the point is that it is not true that ""a vanishingly small amount of folks"" earn the vast majority of income, or the median American lives at the poverty line."

But what if I don’t have medical costs etc?
"Agree to all of those but nursing homes, those are a luxury of the same vein and cigarettes. Don’t put your folks in a home folks it’s unnatural and immoral."
"The list provided is already in PPP (purchasing power parity) - just look at India, where disposable income is higher than nominal GDP. 

I deeply dislike PPP as a measure for developed countries, but if you want it adjusted it already is."
do you know what 'median' means?
Median isn't average fyi
">  the average looks great

Median is not average. Medians means that half the people earn more, half the people earn less. A few billionaires do not distort the median at all."
What do you think the mode income is? I can’t even find a data point for it. Assuming you exclude $0 since that would be the mode for the full population.
"Of the two countries above the US, Switzerland (I live there) does not have free healthcare, free nursing homes, or free college.

But the point was not what is the disposable income used for; the point is that it is not true that ""a vanishingly small amount of folks"" earn the vast majority of income, or the median American lives at the poverty line."
"This depends on what you are calling 'income'.  Are you only including 'wages earned' that would be on a w2, or are you including all income via capital gains, stock increases, business income etc.  If you calculate for the former, then sure, but for the latter, less than 100 people basically lay claim to the overwhelming majority of 'earnings'."
it also has the most income and wealth.
Capitalism eliminates poverty at the cost of wealth inequality. Statistics don’t lie.
"Wealth, income, and GDP are all different things."
"Producing value into the economy, that how the dollar works. Although maybe we should distribute that dollar but that leads to less incentives. It’s not a zero sum game as most 20 something year old liberals on Reddit believe."
"No, it isn't right around the poverty line."
"No it couldn’t. 2% of the population is exactly the same amount of people at either wealth level. In a country of 330,000,000 it’s about 6.6 million people."
"Mode will almost definitely just be minimum wage. Annual pay is too variable for mode to be any useful. 

You would need to round all pay to the nearest thousand to get anything useful."

I mean demographic trends are on his side. Unless you’re arguing CA is growing lol.
"The point I was making is that I don't think desirability is equatable to value. I think demand is a much stronger comparison to desirability, because its literally how many people desire to live there.  You can easily conflate low supply with high demand when using price as the marker of desirability."
"I agree actually. I hate public transport. From an individual point of view, I’d much rather have my own space and my own destination. I just mean from a numbers and analytics point of view."
"As an Aussie, I've always wondered how much I would have to pay for health insurance monthly, to get the equivilent of our universal healthcare system.

How much would insurance cost in the USA so that whenever I go to the doctor or hospital the bill is zero?

Perscription medication is capped at $38/script (or $6 for low income)."
According to US economist Joseph Stiglitz the richest 1% of Americans gained 93% of the additional income created in 2010.
">Of the two countries above the US, Switzerland (I live there) does not have free healthcare, free nursing homes, or free college.

College is practically free in Switzerland (at least compared to the US numbers). Except for that your point is correct."
"That doesn't address the issue, doesn't contradict the given facts. In America the median income is just above the American poverty line and the wealth divide is nuts."
"> but their health expenditures per capita are, according to the WB, higher than those of Americans (I think they are the only country in the world).  
  
Not according to wikipedia  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita"
I get that Norway uses it's oil to fund government programs and that  you can't compare it to just any other county. But doesn't the US have vast amounts of natural resources including oil as well?
Switzerland has a much more consumer friendly healthcare system. I know its not your main point but I refuse to allow the two systems be characterized as similar.
Then you're lucky.
"Yes, however, the cost is not nearly as much as it is in the US. I agree with your last point."
"Just says adjusted gross income, not specific only to wages earned but also not wealth and assets since that is skewed even further."
"The USA is actually 19th in the global ranking of income per capita.

Edit: and as for wealth, how rich is a country that's $25 trillion in debt?"
"So as long as the rich get richer and the poor stay the same, despite working hard, everything is fine? I'm not arguing with statistics, I'm talking about morality.

Also, looking at the US and the UK, I'm still seeing a shit-ton of poverty. When does it's elimination kick in?"
Your response has nothing to do with the question.
No because it's about 2% of the top wealth level and 2% of the bottom wealth level. It's not about population. It's about the difference in population in each sample
"Not very many people actually make minimum wage. I'm just going off memory but I think it's only about 3%.

I wouldn't be surprised if the mode for hourly was $10. I feel like that is an extremely common hourly wage."
"The fact it would be on or near minimum wage is exactly why I think it's revealing. In a country where the vast majority have experienced 40+ years of wage stagnation (adjusted for inflation), while those at the top have made huge gains, the mean figure might be the same as ever, hiding the fact that income and wealth disparity has increased steadily."
Better than if I was a dumbass:)
"Yes, it's one of Canada's success stories (granted, being able to pick and choose simplifies things, but still)."
West Texas gonna have to grow a ton to be as desirable as The OC (shouts to my boy Seth Cohen).
"In a broad sense you're right, but for one particular house the desirability of it (how many people want it) is I would say the direct result of both supply (how many similar houses are available) and demand (how many people want a similar house). It's just semantics though really."
A plan like that is well into the 5-figures annual
"Its not free, its just that the government pays for it."

No it is not. In America the median income the third highest in the world.

"A small correction on that. We use a maximum of 3% of the gains from the oil fund pr year in the economy. The rest goes into a savings account aka the oil fund. The rest of the money for welfare etc is coming from taxes, and the biggest of those were built up in the 60s and 70s before we had any oil income. That didn't really take off until into the 90s.

Those are all owned by companies that pulled themselves up by the bootstraps to sell them back to Americans at a huge profit so some executives can buy their 14th super yacht. Doing something beneficial to the country with the profit like helping future generations would be infringing in their freedom and is completely unfair to the already marginalised billionaires.
"True. Last I checked, Norway's oil was 15% of their GDP, and America's oil was 8% of theirs. People sure like to talk about that 7% difference."
"Bob, it's been over 20 minutes, I know you are not still pooping, you goofy fucking ginger, get back to your desk and at least pretend to work like the rest of us."
The poor get richer in terms of QOL and purchasing power. I’m not gonna argue with you but I encourage you to do research outside of Reddit by actual economists.
"I know it's rather low, but salary is extremely variable person to person. Minimum wage is a set minimum. It'll either be that or $0."
"Not really - between $1,000-100,000, there are nearly ten million different salaries down to each penny. Mode is worthless to determine the average salary."
... Which makes it free to the person attending college. Exactly is the metric we are trying to measure. Nothing is truly free.
"someone admitting being wrong on social media?  
Are you an unicorn?"
"Norway and Canada had the **amazing** advantage of finding enormous quantity of oil after having become good, relatively wealthy, well-run societies. Both of them managed to avoid the resource curse and all that happens poor countries when they become suddenly rich. 

It is something we have studied in depth in Economics of Development."
"Thanks for the correction! This shows that creating such a fund might actually be doable for other countries as well. Do you personally like that system?

Also very nice website, very beautiful data."
You prefer the other option that the government owns everything and doles it out to whom it desires?
May I offer you a free helicopter ride?
"Yeah, what does he think we are, socialist commies?!"
"That's a great point, I was not aware of this. However oil isn't the only natural resource a nation can exploit. Also it's not only about how much larger it makes the economy, it's about how you use the wealth created by that economy."
There would obviously need to be banding applied - every single person earning over a million undoubtedly has a distinct income.
"Also, I used the word revealing - precisely because in a country with such a disparity between the top few percent and the bulk of the workforce, the mean gets skewed upwards massively. The Tories in the UK love to use the mean for this reason."
Comment
"I grew up really poor, most people don’t understand how much better you feel physically when the anxiety of how you are going to afford to live is removed.  I am very successful now and I don’t take it for granted.  Being able to live without concern of making ends meet and surviving is literally one of the best feelings in the world.

The goal shouldn’t be for supercars, yachts, and mansions, the goal should be to be able to live modestly without worrying how you are going to pay a bill or feed your family."
"Not the same thing but I am a social worker and we are put through tons of training on how trauma effects children’s health and wellbeing into adulthood, experience of repeated childhood trauma leads to increase of heart disease, obesity, anxiety and tons of other mental and physical ailments. You are also much more likely to die an early death.

EDIT: if you are reading and this and thinking, this might be me/someone I know. I want you to know that therapy and early intervention has also shown the ability to drastically reduce these effects over a lifetime."
"I would suggest you to take a look at Robert M. Sapolsky’s studies on psychological stress. Super interesting readings.

He also has a book called ‘Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers’. Completely on the effects of stress on one’s body. Again super interesting. Grim...but interesting."
And some people live decades not being able to comprehend that
"I’m taking a molecular biology class right now and just the other week we learned that first year residency students (interns) that work an average of 80 hours a week with near minimum wage salary. In just that first year their DNA on average ages 6x faster. DNA aging is when your telomeres (the end region of your chromosomes) shorten ever so slightly after every replication (mitotic division. This correlates to lower lifespan in almost every way and organisms that are immortal, have enzymes in all their cells to protect these telomeres from shortening."
"imagine having to do a group phone call and know the sound of how everyone reacts when they know youre the only not white one. you know that quickening when someone wants to change the topic? its that, but then the conversation keeps going. there was an unsaid thing that was verbally fast forwarded. once you are aware you can hear it. it drives me insane"

"I am poor and a minority and let me tell you it sucks. I can’t change the fact that I’m a minority, but it’s really hard to be financially free. At work people often ignore me because they think I don’t speak English. I can’t move up in the company because they think I have a low IQ and can’t handle big problems. Every time I have an idea to improve my work I get ignored. I try to learn different topics so I could fit in. For example, I started to watching football because that’s all everyone talks about. I’m lost when they start talking about it. I’ll probably die at a young age with nothing to my name."
"I implore anyone to take some global health or community health courses if you can. The public health major is a great eye into a world of people dying around you just because society doesn't work for them the same as everyone else. The inequality is hard to describe until you see it first hand. 

I majored in community health with a minor and passion for global health issues. Community health brings you down to the community level on issues. You'll see all sides and the limitations of policy change, you'll see just how fucked the system is really quick. For global health you get to take all that local community knowledge and learn why most of what works for them won't work for others. The number of the ways to suffer from an unjust system are astronomical."
Was there not a course description?
"No they shouldn't because it isn't actually addressing anything.

Everyone knows it sucks to he poor (not a minority, that's an outright lie).

All this does is further play into leftists identity politics and their goal to continue dividing people until they get their race war?

Instead of saying ""it sucks being poor"" why don't you focus on changing the aspects of the culture that lead to this...?  

Of course that wouldn't be blaming white people for everything and would take some real work by coloured communities, but you may actually get real results. Pretending white people are the source of all issues in these communities does nothing because it's not true."

It might be that being a minority intersects with poverty, so it's actually a poverty issue. But it could also be that people of a certain ethnic origin are genetically programmed to make more or less insulin than other groups, or their bodies are better or worse at storing potassium, which has an effect on developing diabetes. 

Asian women are more likely to get osteoporosis than Latina women, but why? We need answers to ensure we can take preventive measures for different people in an appropriate way."
"I think it's an explorative angle when learning about/describing white privilege. When you start out being the person with less resources as someone who is poor or a minority might be, then it adds a level of stress not everyone can understand."
"They should offer more critical thinking and reading comprehension. That way someone like you would see that nothing was claimed that molecules no race, and the subject of what causes health problems is quite clearly “stress” as the name of the course was in fact Stress. This really only leads us to believe that the teacher also subjectively stated that minorities have higher levels of stress and therefore corresponding health issues at a molecular level (whatever that means, I think she is simply trying to say stress affects physical health and not just mental health)."
Yes.

and second. yeah. successful black people go back to their old communities and help them out literally all the time. Lebron James just recently opened up a tuition free high school in his hometown where every student gets a free bike, free meals, and free college tuition, for fucks sake.

"Or that the racism that minorities have to cope with on a daily basis, that whites people blithely ignore, causes real damage, through stress."
"Ok, thought experiment: what is being said here? That atoms are racist because they don't want to comprise a minority human? Atoms only want to be a non-minority? How do atoms know when they are hosted in a minority, such as a Caucasian in Africa, an African in China, or an Asian in Europe? 

Or are you trying to infer that ""minorities even have their cells attacking them?"""
"I think of you read into the one line gem that she is referring to “stress” and saying a visual minority living in area or state of mind that they worry about racism making things more difficult it can add to their levels of stress. It could be worrying that your hard work will count for less based on your race, or even a worry that your success is seen as unearned based on your race and the advantages that holds."

"If you had read the original post at all, you would know that the stress (the name of the class in question) of being poor or a minority and the effects thereof are what is being discussed. The mental and physical effects of such stress are well documented. Trying to deliberately misunderstand that point to say that OP is claiming that ""atoms are racist"" is ignorance of the highest order."
Are you purposefully misunderstanding what's being said?
I took it as this - being a minority or poor has so many stressful issues where being that worried/scared / sad  about things can affect you on a molecular level.

He was warned by a teacher to stop showing it off, because of how it looked."
Wasn't that kid's clock project debunked on the internet as some type of rewired retail clock you could buy on the internet? People thought it was unearned that he was invited to/attended an event at the White House and met the President.
 I bet the FBI already called her.
"I know i will get downvoted for “different opinion is BAD” but actually his clock looks a typical Hollywood suitcase bomb, i think it will still be the same result if a white kid does it"

First off how the fuck did she get the materials for a bomb at 14
Doesn’t that violate like 14 world peace agreements?
100% sure she threatened to get 1st place

It wasn't a bomb. The Science Depart Chair simply misunderstood the weeb when she said that she wanted a bang like in Japan.
A WHAT

I have severeal questions
She white tho
i know a kid who got arrested cause he took apart clocks for fun/engineering class & they thought he was making bombs. they sent him to juvie & he was in the hearing room next to me and i remember his mom fighting for him. i hope he got out of all that bullshit :)

"Yeah, we don't need low cost water filters. we want nukes"
"Hi everyone, not sure if this is going to be seen, but I have a few things to say:

1. top picture is satire

2.  This isn't that serious. Just a meme, not some deep social commentary. I thought it was funny that the top picture said this girl won her science fair for making a bomb, but the guy got in trouble for being accused of making one. Its just a funny comparison. 

3. Just stop the conspiracy theories. Nobody cares.

4. Please don't be islamaphobic. That's just rude. Memes shouldn't be a place for that."
Female privilege
The clock boy was a political stunt his father is a political figure he did it to start a faux outrage. If you don’t want to cause a panic don’t build a clock that looks like a holly wood bomb and bring it to school. This girl built a demo of a nuclear bomb that is on a completely different level than taking apart a alarm clock and putting it inside a box. It’s not the same thing its more race baiting to trigger the useful idiots.
"He took apart a clock and [reassembled it to look like a bomb](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39982239), big difference which people always gloss over.

His family's claims of discrimination were thrown out when it went to court. Probably because he took apart a clock and reassembled it in a briefcase to look like a bomb.

But at least his trolling got him a visit to the Whitehouse.

"If you're determined enough, you can use the Americium in your smoke detectors as a neutron source and target, and basically just keep refining it until you get uranium.

And his dad wasn’t at all famous for being litigious
"To everyone who doesn’t have a room temperature IQ, he took a screwdriver and dumped the guts of a clock into a different container 

But to the media, that was equivalent to designing, engineering, and building electronic circuits."
"> His engineering teacher, upon seeing the clock said, ""That's really nice"", but advised him to keep the device in his backpack for the rest of the school day, as he thought it resembled something akin to a briefcase bomb. Mohamed, however, later plugged it in during his English class and set a time on the clock. When the clock alarm started beeping, the English teacher requested to see it, and said, ""Well, it looks like a bomb. Don't show it to anyone else"""
It was a pencil case.
Iirc he was showing it off to everyone at school and telling them it was a bomb lmfao
[deleted]
Oh gno.
The dad was a known race baiter too who seemed to put his son up to doing this.
"He also ended up getting expensive stuff for free from many big companies for PR since some were calling this racist to arrest him and that the kid was a genius for his “engineering”.

If any kid did this at a school, I’d hope the school wouldn’t take the chance to harm the other kids. You have no idea if the clock could be a real bomb or not."
Didn't that kid's dad have some sort of dubious connections or political interests as well?  Kind of seemed like a publicity stunt from the beginning.
yeah clock boy was a scam and the media fell for it.
"Yeah, it was a bullshit scam orchestrated by the dad, and the MSM bought it hook, line, and sinker. Their family moved to Qatar afterwards, and I don't think any of the colleges that offered him scholarships are set to keep those promises."

Yep! Baking soda volcano leads to Nobel Prize!
"When I was young, I entered a science fair with my very first Inator. I-- I wasn't very clever with names yet. It was just, you know, Inator. Just as I was about to demonstrate my invention to the judges, a kid with a baking soda volcano stole the show! The next year, I tried again with my even bigger Inator. And again, my thunder was stolen by a baking soda volcano! I had enough of science. I decided to devote my life to poetry instead."
it would still beat a nuke
Coincidentally I had the same unique idea !
"I can't find the article right now but there's a town near me in Massachusetts that has a law against detonating nuclear devices because a kid built one for a science fair and it went off. I'll try to find the article. But it seems like you CAN build one, just not a very powerful one."
Yea you can get thorium as diffrent solution dont aks how I know
"""I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by."""
Its pretty much the only reason why the materials are so restricted.
Isn't getting the conventional initiating explosives to detonate in just the right way to create compression shockwaves really difficult?

"Small point of clarification, smoke detectors typically use americium, which is typically produced from uranium in nuclear reactors. In addition to americium  he gathered small quantities of thorium, tritium and radium for his neutron source."
There is a [proper documentary about it](https://youtu.be/aBuOJn03QVo)
"Getting uranium isn't hard, it's refining it that's difficult, there's a reason they asked literal Einstein to help the first time.

I remember that episode. Lol.
"Im not thinking that, however something similar has happened before. But eventually legal did step in. Some kid made a nuclear reactor in his moms shed and gave the whole neighborhood cancer pretty much."
Or for being part of a pro-islamic faction that was linked to Hamas.
"He also heavily implied it was a bomb and was obstinate when the school asked him what it was. He was looking for the headline ""Muslim student expelled for bringing clock, thought to be bomb, to school"" so his dad could sue."
"He also showed it everyone at his school, even after the first two teacher advised that he not do that since the thing clearly looks like a cartoon bomb. After the third or fourth teacher he showed it to, ignoring their advice, he was brought into the principals office. His father later ran for public office off the controversy. 

Kids a fucking rat and so is his rat father. Imagine getting your son in trouble just to facilitate a bid at a local govt position."
It resembled a briefcase
"Think? It has been documented that is what he did. I don't think he should've been arrested, he did something stupid - that's all. But removing quite a bit of the context from the situation is silly, especially when it is race baiting. 

Yeah, maybe you shouldn't take items that look like real bombs to school, with the US history of mass shootings and the like."
At least we all learned a valuable lesson that lying and cheating pays off
"Fun fact, he sued, got a huge payout and then moved to Qatar"
"Yeah, I member Larry Wilmore gave him an Apple Watch. And then Comedy Central gave Larry Wilmore the opportunity to explore other creative endeavors..."
If I recall correctly he was a politician in an African country (can't recall which) soon to participate in an election.
"Yes. The kid's dad built the suitcase clock and coached the kid on how to be extra sketchy.

The kid mentioned one of his hobbies was ""soldering CPUs""."
That make double the discrimination
"He placed a disassembled clock into a suitcase, plugged it in during class and set an alarm on it after already having been warned by a prior teacher that he shouldn’t be showing it off. He was not discriminated against. 

https://i.imgur.com/AYAQNNM.jpg"
"Well this is a satire article, so we can assume it's neither."
"No he wasn’t, it was literally a suitcase with a RadioShack clock internals wired to it and looked very much so like a bomb and it was later found out that it was just a publicity stunt for his career politician father to boost his unsuccessful campaign to become the President of Sudan."
">I think it's more racism, because he was discriminated against for being muslim

No he was not.

1. He built something intended to look like a bomb on purpose because he was trying to bait a reaction.

2. Multiple teachers refused to take the bait and told him to put that shit away.

3. After disobeying teachers repeatedly, and after he purposely set it to ""go off"" in class while in his backpack, one of his teachers realized that he was intentionally trying to troll and fuck with people and sent him to the principal's office.

4. In Texas, trying to scare people with a fake bomb is a crime. Nobody ever thought he had a bomb. Everyone was convinced he was trying to troll people to get a reaction. The police came and questioned him about his intentions. He was evasive and uncooperative, which convinced them that he was acting in bad faith, so they correctly arrested him.

5. His parents demanded $15 million dollars for the supposed ""discrimination"", showing it was a set-up all along."
"it was purposely made to look like a bomb. he didnt build anything, he took a clock and took out the internals then put it in a suitcase with wires poking everywhere.

the point was for it to get picked up by media so sheep like yourself would eat it up, since you are incapable of doing any further research."
You know this isnt real right?
"This is untrue. The kids father has a history of using his children to race bait and start lawsuits.

Shortly after the clock bomb one failed, he moved back to his home country. The guy is a total scumbag and managed to fool most of the country with his bullshit."
"Kid literally disassembled a clock and stuck it in a case and was told multiple times 'that's nice, stop showing it off because it looks like a bomb' but carried on. 

That whole incident was an example in abusing victim status."

You could probably cover a large area in radioactive crap easy enough"
"No, you can't build a nuclear bomb. You can build a nuclear pile and produce a lot of heat but a nuclear bomb is a totally different beast. 

The guy who built the nuclear pile did it by scrounging radium from clocks and watches, it was commonly painted onto dials to make them glow in the dark. Scrape all that off, put it in a pile, add a little magic, baby you got a stew going.

I don't know how enriching works exactly, but it's not an easy process (especially if you want to do it safely, breathing radioactive dust is not a good idea) and I'd be surprised if you can get enough ore for a decent amount of fuel without ending up on a watch list.

Edit: Others more knowledgeable than me have pointed out that it's the equipment for enrichment which is controlled, not the uranium ore itself."

He got the material from exit signs
Really isn't so similar once you actually think about it
"For a baby, maybe. It was like 9"" wide."
"Actually if he was warned it could have been mistaken for a bomb and he continued to show it off, contacting the police was warranted. Even having a hoax bomb is illegal in Texas, so if he's continuing to show it off despite warnings it could be mistaken for a bomb then I'd say there's genuine concern that he intended for it to be mistaken for one or didn't care if it was."
"> Yeah, maybe you shouldn't take items that look like real bombs to school, with the US history of mass shootings and the like.

He probably should have listened to the first teacher he showed who (paraphrasing) told him “That’s cool but don’t go waving it around because some idiot here will think it’s a bomb”."
I thought he didn't win anything and had all the lawsuits dismissed. He then received a scholarship from like a Qatari Education board so his family decided to move to Qatar because they were being harassed by conspiracy theorists. My opinions on it? Probably shouldn't be bringing a disassembled clock in a suitcase to school.
Sauce?
"Funner fact, he lost all the lawsuits and had to pay the legal fees."

And it has exposed AC wiring making it very dangerous."

if you end up in possession of any kind of weapon involving uranium i think watchlists are not going to be a problem
"Because uranium is fairly abundant, a lot of non/counter proliferation work is instead focused on limiting shipment/sale of components that can be used to build gas centrifuges.

You probably wouldn't raise too many flags getting the uranium, but buying/building/operating a huge array of centrifuges likely would."

He made a volcano, painted it, took care not to break it, but it didn't work. That was because he had ""tested"" it at home. By that he meant that he's already used the volcano at home and thought you can just add baking soda to make the volcano ""erupt"" endlessly."

He killed himself after becoming addicted to meth and alcohol over 15 years later. There were probably other factors which may have been in play and more influential at that time.

"I can't possibly ever comprehend flying that stupid flag.

It is a symbol of people so racist they committed the largest act of treason in US history, resulted in the bloodiest war in our history.

How the flying shit is that patriotic? The flag was literally explicitly made when they detached themselves from the us. It wasn't a preexisting thing they used, it was specifically made for when they BETRAYED AND LEFT THE US. 

And its not like its being reclaimed, reclaiming is used to reverse the meaning of things used as prejudice against your group, not something your group used against others.

And I'm not trying to lump random southerners alive now with the Confederates, but its hard not to when THEY FLY THEIR FUCKING FLAG.

I'm told its a ""symbol of the south"". First off, I'm from Arizona, so the south west, and we have plenty of symbols that don't require honoring the worst people in our country's history. But second off, it represents THE WORST OF THE SOUTH!

"In 2003 I travelled from the UK to visit a friend in the States. While there I bought a Confederate flag because it looked ‘cool’. My friend at the time told me not to let her dad see it. I didn’t understand why and stupidly didn’t ask why either. 

Fast forward 16 years and I face-palmed HARD after reading about the history of Confederacy - their motives and beliefs - and, most importantly, what that flag means to so many black people. In Europe I may as well have bought myself a Swastika.

Needless to say that flag is long gone and anyone who buys one knowing it’s history is a piece of shit with no excuses. If I owned a store that sells mostly confederate memorabilia - I’d happily liquidate my business. This bitch is knowingly profiteering on its history which makes her even worse than her customers."

"This is the battle flag of the CSA. The actual ""country's"" flag had 3 stripes and I beleive 13 stars correct me if I an wrong but people mix them up and perfer to fly the battle flag. I say if you want to fly any flag of the Confederacy you should fly the countrys flag. But I don't know much."
Noooooo waaay. Would have never guessed it....
"As an Australian, our history education never really touched on much of American history.  I’ve seen a lot of stuff about people being pissed off with confederate flags in the past and kind of just accepted they were bad in some way and never knew why and never researched it further.

Due to all the BLM stuff going on (I don’t mean to minimise it but I just can’t keep up with it all) I looked up on Wikipedia “The Confederate States of America” - [Link Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America?wprov=sfti1).

This was the THIRD sentence:

Coming from a non-american: what i dont get is. Why all the fuss about this shit now? This match has been played 160 years ago. The South lost.  North won. Why not just move on? What’s the point of all this?

So somehow this southern pride, in her mind, is all based on ancestry.  

I don't think that makes waving the flag around appropriate. Nor what it, in totality stands for. 


Just sharing some info.  I figure it helps to understand the minds of the meek"
"It was the flag for the Southern states that seceded during the civil war. Those states were butthurt because the US wanted to abolish slavery, so they split from the country. So in a sense it's a type of pro slavery flag, but a lot of southerners dont seem to understand that.

I'm giving a really rough summary. Obviously theres more nuances to the situation."
"The flag was flown by the confederate states during the civil war in the US. The confederacy represented the Southern States below the Mason Dixon that broke off from the union due to disagreements about slavery. 
The flag is no longer used or flown in the US. only ties and representation for the flag is as the confederate flag that was flown riding into battle."
"Its the flag of the confederacy that succeeded from the union in the US Civil War.  

Most all the state's declarations of succession cite the main reason as holding onto their slaves.  The southern states economies were all built around cotton producing plantations off the backs of african slave labor, and they tried to create a new confederacy that ""respected their states rights"".  

Most people today that fly that flag cite heritage, not hate, and pretend the war was fought because of federal overreach.  What they conveniently leave out is that they're saying its the states right... to own slaves.  Its the same thin veil of racism were dealing with that kicked off the protests.  

People are calling it out, and confederate statues because it strikes to the core of America never really embracing a level playing field mentality and hanging reminders in the town square of a violent past for minorities that step out of line."
I bet those people who says confederate flags don’t symbolize racism also doesn’t know what it stands for or what happened in the past.
What about during a reenactment of civil war battles? Question mark.
"While usually that cut and dry, you overestimate the mental capacity of many people. Some like the flag just because it's called the 'rebel flag' and they want to be a 'rebel' not knowing the history or what it really stould for."

Read a history book most Confederate leaders were white slave owners who wanted to keep their right to own trade and abuse free human labor and they were very racist against the African people they kept enslaved

(My tone is mocking the racists, I hope nobody thinks that I agree with them)"
"Well that’s the question right?   The south fought an actual war..against its own country..for the right to own other people.   This flag is a nod to that. The subtle wink and nod that the south was “correct” and blacks should be slaves.   You don’t see a lot of southerners flying this flag-if you do, you could probably assume they are poor white trash who say things like “the south will rise again” while having states that are last in every category of growth..education, pay, college education."
And don't give me that party of Lincoln bs the republican party then was pushing stronger federal government and was really a different party.
"So that's why people want it banned, I see."
"It's also not the one people typically seen in southern culture here. The one you see in America was a Navy flag. The design was used in various flags and two of the ""official"" flags but not as it is commonly seen but with white surrounding it."
I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I have seen some of the Southern Rock bands from the 70s having confederate flags hung around them concerts and music videos. Does this imply that they too were racists in their ideology?
"No. The main reason was the south wanted to be governed by the state. The union wanted the federal government. Lincoln didn't give a fuck about black people. The emancipation proclamation was a byproduct of the politics. 

That being said flying a losing flag is stupid."
"It’s not the exact flag, but it’s based on confederate battle flags. 

When you read the words of confederates, it’s pretty clear that they were focused on slavery. They viewed it as some kind of moral crusade (or at least talked about it that way to defend it). If not for slavery, the civil war wouldn’t have happened."
Then you’re an actor portraying a racist.
"That's acceptable as they are not being racist, they a re portraying racist person through acting."
"It's the battle flag of Virginia, so even that should be a limited number of cosplay guys who would even need to."
I’m not up to date on my civil war uniforms but I don’t think that the confederate uniforms had flags on them
"Alllright Mr wiseacre, go to your room"
Ignorance is not an excuse.
Gould answer.
"Two men in a committed relationship in 2020 should have the lgbt flag instead. 

If you want a symbol that romanticizes criminality just stick with the Jolly Roger. At least not all pirates were losers."
Even then it was sus.
...and racism.  They had black friends and were always the ones being inclusive toward the black people and cops on the show.
"If you think the civil war was about anything other than slavery, it is you who needs to “understand history”. Jesus. 

I have a degree in history. And one in political science."
It’s more like Jim Crow era propaganda.
It doesn’t even make sense as a symbol of southern pride. It wasn’t used for very long by southern states. It regained popularity as a racist symbol during the civil rights movement.
"You say you dont see the harm, but are you a member of one of the communities that are targeted by white supremacists?"
">but many southerners use it as southern pride

What the fuck is there to be proud of? The south was scared Lincoln would tell them that they couldn't own people so they threw a tantrum and started their own country. Then, after a short 4 year war, they got their asses handed to them by the union. It's a literal fucking loser flag.

And I say that as a born and raised southerner."
"Hi guys, Southerner here. While personally I don’t like the confederate flag because of... you know... racism, I do know people who like it not because of the slavery aspect but because of the liberty/freedom ideals behind it. These are good people who support this flag because they believe in freedom, not oppression"
"Man so if I want new friends all I have to do is go to southern states and tell the people flying the confederate flag that it's racist and that they should stop doing that?

Who knew it was ever that easy??"
"The sole reason the Confederacy existed in the first place was the preservation of chattel slavery. Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone speech tells us as much. South Carolina, the first state to secede, cited the North's reluctance to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act as its reason for leaving the Union.

Anyone who flies that flag and claims it's not representative of slavery is a historical revisionist and a liar."
"Let’s all just start killing each other and may the best people win, would that make you feel a little better on the inside, champ?"
"Thanks for the source

Explaining a confederate flag owner has racist ties....


Cause. This. Guy. Needed. Proof.


What the fuck is happening lmao
A confederate flag store.. maybe not racist?"
"I'd rather them not. Not only would banning it be against the first amendment, its way more convenient to visually see that someone is a bigot without having to interact with them and be unpleasantly surprised later"
Because technically it is freedom of speech. Im no fan of banning shit just cause you don't like it. We should just shame people who fly it.
"No. 

Don't hate, hear me out.

If you let everyone fly the colors you let everyone see their colors."
"I don’t think it should be banned from private use, but I do think we should ban it from public spaces and discourage its use."
"I kinda like it, its a cool flag."
"Get over a major symbol of slavery, oppression, racism, and treason?

Maybe the subhumans who fly it should try getting over the fact that they lost instead."

Final Fantasy 15 took over two Confederacies to develop.
Are you trying to piss them off? Good.
"Pretty much. A lot of people will say ""the flag represented states rights!"". But they seem to forget that the ""rights"" they were fighting for was their right to keep slaves. 

Were all fucked up here in the US."
The other poster gave a very one-sided and inaccurate explanation. Truth is that one half of the country wanted to wreck the agriculture industry of the other half.
Interesting note. I wasnt aware.
"Semantics at this point in history my friend. To 99.9% of people in the US, this is the flag of the confederacy, right or wrong."
Yes. The south wanted to be governed by the state........so they could own slaves.
And what about being governed by the Union did the South not like? Was it the part where they said the south couldn't own people anymore? I think it might be...
Imagine how uninformed about history you have to be to actually believe this

Why are you booing him? He's right???
Yes comrade. Send them to the gulag for betrayal of the cause.
The Golden Age of Piracy lasted much longer than the Confederacy as well.
It's exactly Jim Crow era propaganda.
"It's a symbol for loser traitors. It was dug back up specifically to antagonize black people. 

The narrative of the Confederate flag as a symbol of southern pride is just passive aggressive propaganda to excuse racist antagonism."
Pokemon Go lasted longer than that flag.
[deleted]
The people you're talking about are ignorant of the significance in modern times of the flag.
"Liberty and freedom, aye?

The liberty and freedom of white folks to own slaves."
"You should never shit on someone for asking for proof of anything. No one is saying the confederate flag doesn’t represent racism. The dude
just wanted proof of the claims of the post headline."
Because there’s such thing as overt racism and covert racism
"i would start one to take money from them

its not like they can really fly it anywhere anymore except their own property"
Personally I would consider calling a black person the N word an incitement of violence. A word like that carries weight.
Well it is a BATTLE flag from an armed rebellion that then spent years lynching people during reconstruction. Seems pretty incite-y to me.
The police wouldn’t enforce the ban anyway. This is something we have to do as citizens.
Also a ban will just make racists want it more.
"The first amendment has limitations though. You can’t yell fire in a crowded area, so I think “you can’t fly a racist flag and call it your heritage” falls into the category of reasonable limitations."
"Yes, get over it

Are you a Democrat?"
I have gone without sex longer than the confederation.
Isis has last d longer than the confederacy.
"What's up with your trend to have clothing literally made of the US flag (the normal one) anyway? I've never seen any piece of flag clothing in the EU in my life, except maybe hats or scarfs during the Football World Cup . But then again nationalism here isn't well received from the outside world, because of our past, I'm german.."
"I'd also argue in that vein that one of the US's biggest problems is that there are different laws and rights attributed at the state and federal levels. To have any kind of coherency, that really should change. The idea of different penalties for the same crime, or different definitions of a crime entirely, is utterly wild."
...by removing the unpaid workforce.
"That was part of it, sure. To think that's what the entire civil war was over is asinine. Read a book dude."
The south wanted to be governed by the state. The winners write the history books. That's why you never hear about all of the black people that were here long before white people. Guess what they were doing? If you guessed trading slaves you were right!
[It's OK so long as you stay in character ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiLVAz-Jczg)
"Hahaha! I guess I should have said “you’re a racist portraying a different, historical racist”."
what? it depends on how good they act? and that makes them racist?
Don’t think you can count the confederacy as real
"There are a lot of people upset we no longer let them skate by with this stupid flag. 

The people  that shout ""but it's my hustory"" never paid attention  to history class and have no clue this was just one of many battle flags of southern soldiers. This was never the flag of the Confederate army but they dont know that. 

In short the downvotes are from butthurt."
Ignorance is an integral part of racism.
Holding people accountable for their actions = sending people to gulags. How does this follow
Or are you ignorant of the fact that a symbol can mean different things to different people
"Yeah. I’m thinking as a non racist trying to have a confederate flag store...

Not happening.

Maybe an online store? Lmao jk"
"Oh my god. It's like the ""protect against 5G"" chips. I call that fair game."

People flip their shit if a flag is found on the ground (flag code shit again) but will wear that flag all day as a t shirt. Go figure."
"I am French and I was gifted PJs with the American Flag on the shirt when I was little. Back when the ""American Way of Life"" was still a thing to be hyped about."

"If a symbol was made and built on a concept of fighting for ones right to own slaves, thats what the symbol means. Pick a new one, make a new one to mean something about how nice southern life is. The swastika used to be a Buddhist symbol of peace, and when it was stolen from them the Buddhists just stopped using it. They don't talk about how ""Its a symbol of simpler times and a different way of life."" Get tae fuck with that.


Edit: the swastika wasn't a Buddhist symbol of piece, unless it was a symbol for pieces of pie cause those are pretty damn peaceful."
"I'm absolutely sure that people exist who don't know their history, have bought into the ""heritage"" thing, and are not racist at all."
you could probably sell it on toilet paper and they’d happily wipe their ass with it not realizing what theyre doing to “their heritage”
"Oh right, british people love their flag too, but I've never seen one myself no."
"Flag code actually says it's fine to wear clothing with the American flag printed on it.

You’re absolutely right. And that’s why I don’t support it. I’m merely trying to promote understanding here by saying that it can mean different things other than slavery to certain people.
"Thats easier said then done, but hey I’ll try"

"Coz the British flag looks cool. If you see someone wearing the *English* flag...the boring, boring English flag...  Then most likely you'll be talking to a racist. which is quite sad"
"Ah, my mistake. Either way, cringey in my book."
"And I think the point is, even if the people flying it don't have that intent, it is still harmful because it signals to black people that they are not welcome. So at that point, intent really gets thrown out the window."
"How is it easier said than done? You as an individual just don't need to use the shitfederacy flag. If you see other people using it, explain to them the error of their ways. ITS THAT FUCKING SIMPLE. Clearly your just too simple to understand that concept."
It sure does seem like patriotism is being hammered into you from a very young age on. To the point where some people just seem to make that their whole identity and any criticism of the US is a personal attack or whatever. I've even witnessed that here on reddit.
"Oh, for sure. I do believe that trend is slowly coming to an end as the boomer generation dies off. The younger generations understand better that the US isnt the entire world and isnt always the good guy."

Flatten the curve is a strategy to slow down the infection rate, therefore evryone will have equal chance to access to health services (theoretically), and the graph would show a horizontal-ish line.

The joke here is that the graph go skyrocketed to a vertical line, meaning that there are limitless number of new infections recorded that day. It is totally opposite to what ""flatten the curve"" meant to imply, but technically the curve is ""flattened""."
When u say : flattened the curve u actually mean that the curve is flat but on the horizontal Axis so that the number of cases remains the same but in fact its vertical which means there is an infinite amout of cases in such a small amount of time

This is the whole point of the lockdown, the flatten the curve. The virus has arrived, we know that.

The dotted line is how many the health system can handle at the same time.

What kind of paper are u writing?
"If you don’t produce a vaccine (or do an widely spread it) isn’t this bound to be close to the graph for herd immunity? I’m sure I could google the technical definition but like you said, one day we will test and antibodies will show up in most still living humans, no?"
"Good point, hadn't spotted that."
I don't know because 0+ and 0- give opposite results so what could be the result if the middle point could be true. One way to have a good idea is to have the absolute of this

I can’t bake
When men know how to cook and bake it is the sexiest thing to me... well not the sexiest. But it’s way up there.
Run while you can before Big Mom catches you with that.
Imagine being able to feel emotions.
"I really really appreciate how this depicts emotions and crying in two different panels.

Yes crying is emotional, but it feels like a lot of people think that’s the only emotional response men need normalized.

I mean duck, I get scared, I get nervous, and feel shy just as much as I can laugh or feel pride. I’m sick of being stoic all the time.

Let me feel, damnit!"
"Society: Idk man, seems a bit gay to me..."
I can make noodles
Finally the scroll of truth
"*Crying While Baking* seems like a good name for a concept business in LA that combines therapy with baking. You go into a large kitchen and make scones and then eat an entire pint of Haagen Dazs and think about your life while the scones bake. The therapist does nothing. In fact, it's just a cardboard cutout of Rudy from the movie, *Rudy*.

It'll be right next door to my other business idea: *Farting Yoga*. It combines yoga with a diet heavy in beef and beans. The studio has a bank of 6 industrial fans to suck the air out of the entire place out every second and replace it with the scent of muffins baking next door. And they're loud fans too. You can rip stinkers and groan as much as you want. Also, you get to choose if you would like a session with or without mirrors. For the second option, the mirrors are all covered with rad posters from dorm room walls of the 1980s. The lights are dimmed too, so you don't have to spend your farting yoga session looking at yourself and the three intersecting blobs that combine to form your shitty body like a half-melted snowman. Instead, you can peer upon a velvet unicorn next to the fabulous mullet of Richard Dean Anderson clad entirely in denim.

Next to that business on the strip mall will be, obviously, a burrito place that serves massive beef and bean burritos that look like you're holding a baby in a blanket. But here's the gimmick: Each table comes with a bucket of Legos for you to play with while you're dining. Also, the baby-sized burritos are named, so you're handed the beefy monster and told, ""This is your burrito, Jeff. Eat him."" Sure, it's a cleanliness nightmare, but every Lego brick is run through a dishwasher every day of the week except Tuesday.

So you meditate while fiddling with Legos and eating a huge burrito named Gary. Then you go next door and blast ass and get a little exercise. Then you go next door again and make a strawberry rhubarb pie for your mom while telling Rudy about how your feet were malformed because your shoes were too small as a kid and you never complained about this to your parents because you knew they couldn't afford new shoes. And that's why you go barefoot a lot as an adult, because it was a habit born out of poverty."
Men can also binge eat said bakery with said emotions
I will kiss this man in manly man to man
"Men can have feminine traits and that doesn't make them a woman, but people will treat you based on your traits and characteristics."
Man he should be proud. A croquembouche is not an easy thing to make.
I’ve always wanted to get super good at cooking/ baking things but I’m always afraid I’ll just end up failing at it
Thats... thats just normal right?
"Some people forget that pink was considered a masculine color.

*In the 1920s, some groups had been describing pink as a masculine color, an equivalent of the red that was considered to be for men, but lighter for boys. But stores nonetheless found that people were increasingly choosing to buy pink for girls, and blue for boys, until this became an accepted norm in the 1940s.*"
Men who can bake are very sexy
Men CANT eat all of this alone! They need help! By someone like me!
croquembouche is so cool it is the french version of wedding cakes! Also a few other things but mostly weddings
What about enbies?
"Yaknow im a man, but I never feel the need to show emotions or stuff like that. Not saying that its wrong but I dont know if men needs people saying all the time that its ok for them to show emotions/cry etc. I know many dudes who shows emotion, and no one has ever said that they shouldnt or that theyre unmanly for it..."
\*Big Mom wants to know your location\*
"Society 

*no*"
I want one of those. They look tasty.
"All jokes and stale homophobia in the comments but let me lay it down for you.

The suppression of emotion leads to violence. 

On a second note.  Men need to stop putting  themselves into these tiny defined boxes to avoid the ridicule of being called gay.  First off it’s not the 90s that shit don’t carry weight.  Secondly, it’s not the 90s so the person saying that to you has way more explaining to do.

Men need to cry when they feel it.  Tears harden into bullets if not expressed.  Men need to express emotion when they feel it.  Dress however the fuck you want.   Have whatever hobby you want.  You know what’s gay?  Being attracted to and arroused by men.  It has nothing to do with expression, or interested.  I’m tired of men acting like there’s only one definition of masculinity, and then tip-toeing on eggshells cause they are afraid of what others will think.  

My nation (USA) could have avoided a ton of violence if we could have accepted these ideas earlier, and here in this thread I’m reminded that the fear still exists.  A lot of you need to look in the mirror and be real with what you are afraid of."
I really want to learn how to bake now
*Man About Cake intensifies*
"It’s like society wants men AND women to be purely focused on the economy and procreation!

Buy thing, make child, buy more thing!"
"You say that but i can't cry even when i'm sad, even if i'm alone, even if i want to. 

I just get this awfull thitghtness in the chest and thoart and then i push it down in the ""unresolved emotional trauma that will fuck you up later in life"" portion of my brain.

The worst part is now i get emotional like that for the most mundane stuff, i just wish i could get it out of my system every once in a while."
I'm kinda proud of him tho
"Absolutely! I love baking and it's a shame I don't do it more often!


Oftentimes our feelings are invalidated due to how society depicts men and how we were raised, but I am definitely in support of guys doing what they feel like doing because having emotions is not a sign of weakness"
"A lot of people assume ""toxic masculinity"" is just a word invented by some alt-left feminist because it's used by them a lot. I used to think that too.

In actuality, it's referring to the harmful expectations people have for men. You know...be violent, don't show emotions, etc. It leads to a lot of problems for said men like depression, stress and substance abuse.

So yeah...it's **very** misleading.

With that out of the way, I find it attractive when men show emotions."
"Not where I lived, only emotion you’d see was the testosterone of guys wanting to fight that didn’t know how to fight. Atleast something’s are changing tho, can’t wait till it’s more widely accepted"
I always get emotional when I'm on a good kill streak
What's a croquembouche ?
"To be fair pink is one of my fav colors, sincerely a man"
"You can do whatever you want, just don't expect women to be attracted by it!"
Men can eat that whole stack of Croquembouche.
Plz send this to society thx
So is he meant to be gay?
Stop gay
man can find a woman attractive and not automatically like her
Men can look absolutely fabulous in pink
I wear hot pink underwear because it makes me feel sexy
That's the man I'm gonna marry
Makes me think of Bill Burr
Pink is a *Fabulous* colour
"Hells yeah bro, I love baking."
Men are men
"You’ve inspired me, I’ve just watched a bunch of videos in how to make one! It happens in a week haha"
That's a good wisdom
Damn right you’re proud of yourself if you made a croquembouche that tall.
"Hell yeah, I think it even goes past this. I love wearing pink, and I’ve worn skirts and dresses before. I am an amazing cook( told to me by my friends) and growing up I never was into sports, I preferred sewing"
I thought the men cant wear pink shit was way behind since I see a lot of boys with bright pink hoodies
I shall conquest the croquembouche mountain
"Are you sure? My exgf rolled her eyes a lot when I would express myself to her :(
I wish I could bake too"
Why nobody told me this
If I could make a croquembouche like that I don't think I'd be able to fit in aprons for very long.
I love baking but no I personally do not like pink but purple is cool
Pink is my favorite color and I’m going to baking school after this summer
*whole cake island flashbacks*
I love to bake and so does my bro
"There is a difference between knowing how to bake and baking a whole croquembouche. 

But yeah. Sometimes I also lovingly stare at the food I made."
"Pack it up boys, we’re good to go."
Big Mom wants some of that Croquembouche
"Men can also have earrings, MOM!"
Well that was a lie
When u find out ur crush actually likes u lol
"i thought about big mom from One Piece, with that croquembouche"
Pink and purple are the best colors that ever exist
Men like this are the real hubby material
"Well thanks, my life is complete now that I have permission to be a human fucking being."
"And then we are told to ""Man Up"" lol"
"Here's an outrageous idea, we are not defined by our gender. A man can have traits that are commonly affiliated with women and visa versa. We are all individuals with different personalities, ideas, motivations and experiences. Each and every one of us unique. Reducing the complexity of a human to just ""man/women"" is just wrong."
"Im sure most men skipped this word  
 Croquembouche"
what a badass
"A guy in my class once said that guys wearing pink or having pink stuff is gay, so my teacher bought a pink sports bag to proof him wrong."
[Only real men wear pink](https://www.frontlinegaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/40k__bring_the_noise__by_jedi_art_trick-d9cqgh0.jpg)
What pink is a bice color ngl
Anyone else think of big mom just destroying her kingdom from wanting cro-coque-crocobesh to the point of starvation... just me?
He is a manly man
"Yeah, displaying emotions is so gay and girlish bros, women and gays are such emotive and fragile creatures !

What ? Anger ? Psh ! Not emotions. Anger and hatred manly. Violence is bonus. Anger good. Angry man never fragile ! Angry man not emotive AT ALL !"
I lost my emotions long ago so 3/4 Points
No son of mine is going to be a ginger.
I still don’t like pink but all the other ones I love!
who is men and how does he bake
At first I thought he was crying because his baked good fell over and I got really sad. Sp I'm glad that he's crying from joy
Yas shoutout to all my bros our there
He has no soul for he is a red
"I hated pink for most of my life, but then I started using the quartz theme for my razer phone as a joke and that made me like pink"
"Thank you,this is the kind of meme that I need more of,thanks again"
"Of course we can wear pink, it's the best colour"
"I'm a guy that can bake, but I can't think for the life of me why I would cry over a pile of puff pastry. Nothing particularly right or wrong about being emotional or imperturbable."
And they can do all this while remaining men!
"There’s a sit com where one of the episodes revolves around getting a croquembouche for one of the characters weddings. Super vague, but does anyone know what one talking about?"
Anyone hear big mom yelling it?
"Dude, that reminds me of big mom, I never heard something like croquombouche before"
"I never got this. What is more manly?

A) Never showing emotions or doing what you feel like because you fear judgment from others.

B) Being so confident of yourself that you can do whatever you want, including wearing your emotions on your sleeves, and not even be bothered by other people calling you names.

Growing up I always felt like the weakest kids were the ones who got so defensive when someone called them girly. The smartest ones just brushed it off."
I wear pink quite a bit it's truly the only color I get compliments on.
"Men's emotions are more testy like I just want to fuck all the time and when I have a dry spell I get mopey and short tempered and sort of anarchist against the world but then some puss comes allong to quench my needs and then the next day im back to being agro and looking at weird shaped furnature with a sexual thought.   
When I was on SSRI's and my libido totally disapeated it was eye opening, like a realy weight off my shoulders and I felt no stress talking to women because I didn't want to fuck. Started to miss the urges so I stopped taking the SSRI's and I love being a man and getting testy now. The persuit is great and then finally getting into something is amazing."
"Just, uh... just going to leave this here. Link very NSFW.  [https://www.oglaf.com/croquembouche/](https://www.oglaf.com/croquembouche/)"
Thats some impressive croquembouche
"Wonderful, but is missing two more panels:  

MEN CAN ENJOY FLOWERY SMELLING BATHS  

MEN CAN HAVE SKINCARE ROUTINES"
"I don't wear pink nor cry, but everyone loves my bread and that makes me happy."
"I didn’t get the memo, I can neither bake nor have I ever worn pink, I feel I now have to go do both of those immediately to make up for lost time."
"""I'm having feelings again, Mac. Do you remember feelings?""

""Yes Dennis, I have feelings every day of my life. Are you telling me you don't have feelings?"""
Wish it was that easy.
Man can make these memes
I can bake
"And if you’re able to make a good croquembouche, you’re a damn good baker as well. Making quality choux pastry is an art."
"No it can't be, dress in pink? Get this perfectly reasonable post out of my face!"
"It's 2020, men cry more than women at this point"
Wasn't pink a guy color back in the 60s or something?
"When I was a kid someone told me that pink was gay, so I bought pink ruby boots, gloves and a gum shield so I could be manly and 'gay' all at the same time. No regrets"
"Yes, I would like some tea"
I make a hella good lemon meringue pie
"Well, Duff Goldman is famous for baking"
Lmfao
Men can cry and immediately stop being attractive to the majority of women.
But what if I don’t want to?
He reminds me of John from Preppy Kitchen who I absolutely love.
This is the definition of Harry styles
Yesss!!!!
That my friend is called transgender
"I'm more into wake n bake than baking only, but that's fine"
"how do you even spell croquembouche in one go? it's like combining crocs and douche. anyway, gonna see tutorials for this and try it out! :D"
"Thank you u/MCU3000 finally someone acknowledges my emotions, feels nice. It's really rare for that to happen, I'll be smiling about this now for the next couple of months :)"
men can have pupils in their eyes
"My apron has sunflowers on it and I wear it proudly. I love cooking, am learning how to bake, and I will do so emblazoned with the happiest flowers on the planet."
"As a (n unemployed) pastry chef, this is a nice thing to see in the morning!"
simp
That's a lot of takoyaki
gay
Men can be gay
"Thos is awesome,  reminds me of Check Please, checkpleasecomic.com"
Who said we couldn't?
Emotions?
Any dude who can make a croquembouche that looks that nice has earned a foot rub and a handy.
"Recently bought myself a sewing machine and I've gotten a couple of weird looks when it's come up in conversation mostly by women though oddly enough.

If I ever get the courage to wear anything I sew in public I'm not sure I'd admit I've made it myself if anyone asked."
My and my best friends always bake but my immigrant parents always tell me that’s a “women’s job” :(
"Women can change a tire, women can kill what they eat, women can clean a carburetor, women can power through and take hold of their emotions"
This is so gay
My mom just tells me to put my big boy pants on.
Hot pink is honestly my husband's best color to wear. He loves it and now so do I.
"We can, but even if we do many women are not receptive of them, or know how to react."
welp I tried it I defenetly can't cry
Big mom approved this meme
"Well *this* man can bake.

I usually create small, brick-like objects whenever I try to bake."
I read it with Big Mom's voice
Men also apparently have four fingers on each hand
This art style resembles Shadman
*yes we are humans lol
"Love you, men."
"I am in a hetero relationship with a man like this and I love him so much. He takes after his mom in terms of nurturing people with food, and I'm glad that doesn't just have to be a woman's trait."
OK slightly off topic but like 20 years ago there was a cooking show that had a croquembouche in the intro and I can't remember it for the life of me. Any ideas?
"I Started crying for no particular reason at school today and my friend just came up to me, held both my arms and told me to get up so she could hug and comfort me. I think showing emotion is the one of the best ways to build relationships"
"this is a beautiful comic.


but it's ""croque en bouche"".


still, it doesn't put any shadow to the wholesomeness of this comic."
This reminds me of the AP Bio episode where he refused to make cookies
"I can make this killer pastry and so as an offering (and to show off my skills), I brought tla platter of them in to a department all filled with women.

One woman I kind of had my eye on, after I left the room, said to a female coworker, ""These are so good...... is he gay?"" to which the other woman exclaimed, ""I don't know! Haha.""

Anyways, that initial woman and I ended up dating shortly after for about a year. Good sexy times.

Whether it is grilling or baking or anything, know your way around a kitchen and you are way ahead of most men. Good luck fellas!"
Just need the pink apron then
"Haha none of that applied to me


I'm a excuse for a human being"
Some men are gay
Where is the joke?
"They’re called Males, not Men."
Boys have emotions not men
*and this doesn't say anything about their sexual orientation*
Since when was this unknown knowledge lol
Amen
This man is friend material but not allowed to touch my butt.
I made a croquembouche once for a high school french class. It was terrible. I cried.
get outta here with these lies
The plot of Corbin bleu’s side arc in high school musical
Men can do all of those things sure. But 2/4 seems kind of gay which makes it a little iffy.
"Agreed, and men can also watch jojo's bizarre adventures"
"U sure? I dont think that I felt any good emotions, for 2 years."
But they are not allowed to
https://mangadex.org/chapter/172250/4
r/TheFairerSex would disagree
But they can't have pupils or normal elbows :P
That fourth image lools like he is literally falling in love with the stack of food
Who says men can't bake or have emotions?  Most guys I know have all kinds of skills and feelings.  Tbh the depiction in this comic looks super gay and cringey and will more likely turn men OFF from showing their emotions and cooking skills.
This guys gay af
\*AND NOT BE GAY WHILE DOING ANY OF THAT
Beta
This is pretty gay
"I don’t love pink and I don’t know how to bake, other than that I am completely a man!"
Man can be gay.
"I can bake, cry, have emotions and do all 3 at the same time when I fail a cake when its nearly done"
"My fav undies are pink, and yes I can bake. It’s fun. 
I also like girly vodka drinks, and flowers."
Men can do everything but hold their hands in the way that guy is doing in the bottom right slide. As a certified dude I can say that ain’t it chief
Now this is some next level gay shit right here dawg
Russian influence. Men do not fall victim to this propaganda. You are strong. not weak.
*pride is a sin
men cant get pregnant
dunno bruh sounds kinda gay 2 me
IDK man. Seems kinda gay to me.
Okay but Pink still looks strange
No
Why is everyone so obsessed with emotions only gay guys can show their emotions
That's not a man that's something else
Men have emotions but this dude is gay.

Edit: oh right, i cant have an opinion and taste what differs yours. This place is full of bigots (it means you dont tolerate other opinions)."
But I can! And I can rock pink! I’ll help both of us :)
Yeah only thing I can bake is myself
"Well, there is no better time than the present to try to learn something new."
I made my first loaf of bread yesterday. No previous experience. You can do it too!
"Start off with simple things like Pizza Grilled Cheese and every once in awhile try and do something slightly more advanced until you get the hang of it before proceeding with something new, best of luck pal"
You can learn to bake.
"Baking is science.
Cooking is magic.

Baking requires a recipe.
Cooking has guidelines.

All you've told us is that you can follow directions. For shame :)

Although, I can bake, I can't wear pink. Pink on my rotund self doesn't like good."
But you can learn
"I could walk you through it if you like. 

If you have any specific instances you could tell me about, or problem recipes you’ve tried, please I’d love to help. Everyone can bake!"
"You can’t bake well, but you can bake.

Or you don’t have an oven and I’m an ass."
"You *haven't* baked.  But I bet you *could* bake.

It's math and ratios.  Follow a recipe. Get a result.  

^(Minus some extremes from humidity and elevations)

And if you are worried about messing up, or burning - use a disposable pie plate.  Then you can throw your shame into trash without having to clean up the attempt in the sink."
Call yourself a real man?
Not related to the topic but I love Diamond no Ace
Maybe because you are baked
i cant feel
"> not the sexiest

Because of Obi Wan?"
Majority of the cooks out there says hello
Hellu thrtr

It doesnt really matter cus like now in modern society it isnt. Cus like lots of other group consider alot of things masculine or feminine and another wouldnt. Doesnt make either of wrong its just how it is. You know what im saying.

Well yeah. They didn't. But many guys are berated for even accidentally slipping and are told that they are not men if they feel scared, or hurt or god forbid they shed a tear. Granted the whole notion that men should be stoic deadbeats is at least dying out and isn't considered a ""this is the only way you can be considered a man"" thing. There's nothing wrong with not showing emotion. There's nothing wrong with showing emotion. Both are correct lol.

"I feel you. What worked for me is finding that movie that triggered that tightness and then sit alone and watch it again, as many times as i takes, until you break down and let it all out. I know it's really pathetic to have to train on emotions in that ""training wheels"" kinda way, so you can cry over that at the same time. =D

For me that movie will always be The Fountain."
"I personally cry easier when I'm angry than when I'm sad. When I'm sad it's more like what you described. Idk but when I'm pissed AND frustrated it eventually leads to tears in my case. Like not sobbing or anything but the tear ducts do release the pesky fluid. Don't know why, always been like this. Struggled with it for a while due to being put down for it but after a while I just realized that I don't care what they think. It doesn't always happen either, more likely just when I don't really have any medium to get the anger out with at hand so my body goes ""okay we don't seem to have a way to release this so how about the eyes?"". Plus as I got older I got a better control over anger obviously so it's rare."
You could just type this into google instead of a comment and figure it out on your own.
It is a French Pastry puff. They usually pile them up into a cone shape and drizzle chocolate amd or Carmel over them.
A croquembouche or croque-en-bouche is a French dessert consisting of choux pastry puffs piled into a cone and bound with threads of caramel. 
And in the same breath don't expect women to not be attracted by it! There's lots of people who have different turn ons and turn offs on both sides. Just gotta find those who are into your stuff

All that to say that no colour is inherently masculine nor feminine, in fact, from a physics and biological point of view, colour don't even exist and are just signals interpreted in a certain fashion by our brain ; they could havr been totally different..."

Anyone else eat an entire loaf of bread?
">Everyone  
>  
> cares about the opinions of other people, man or woman, and the ones that don't are narcissistic pieces of shit.

Not really. Why should you care about the opinions of strangers who have no effect, information or anything to do with your life for example? There's a select few people whose opinions matter to me, all of them part of my life in meaningful ways. And even then their opinion on what you should be wearing or what should be your hobby isn't exactly what should be dictating your life would it? I've seen it thrown around before that guys who wear rings are gay or married, no ifs or buts. What if a straight guy wears a ring simply because he likes rings? Has absolutely no attraction to men, no desire to be with men, nothing. Sure MAYBE people will think he's gay (idiotic if you ask me but again, nobody has to care about me thinking that), it won't make him gay and it shouldn't put him off wearing a ring.

&#x200B;

What I meant is that a guy can freely show emotion and no one has the right to put him down for that. It's also funny how cooking and baking is largely considered feminine and yet the majority of master chefs are male innit? If doing it is feminine and men who like at are feminine then why? The comic was simply made because for too long the norm of what makes a man was the expectation to be a shallow pos whose sole purpose in life was dirty jokes and humping whatever has a pulse. Was that any better? No. Nothing defines whether you are a man or not that society says. That's the point. That's what I said. What should you or anyone care about who thinks something is feminine or not? THAT's what I meant by saying not giving a shit about what others think. Paint your nails for all I care if you're not into men it doesn't make you gay. Why get so worked up over that statement though instead of thinking about it and not reacting to it at face value tho?"
"I mean you can wear a tutu, high heels and a 9 inch dildo on your forehead, if you are not attracted to men, then no gayness is in place.

&#x200B;

Now granted I'm not sure why anyone would wear those items regardless of sexual orientation but hey. Not my problem. Your sexuality is not a personality lol"
"Sure, although it is quite evident, the picture shows four characteristics of gay shit behavior, wearing pink, crying, baking, and “having emotions” (depicted as being proud of his gay shit, important point, as not all emotions fall under the gay shit category). Btw “gay” in this case has nothing to do with his sexual preferences, but rather with his personality (as in, a male having stereotypical female behavior), hence, thats some gay shit."
"There's nothing intrinsic about it, but wearing things which are considered effeminate by almost everybody is a sign of homosexuality."
"Lol, ok"
And also r/rimjobsteve
"Boo, you whore."
Yws
Toast woth butter makes my day XDD
I'd argue that is a gay thing to do though. Hence why you can be gay without being gay. But I'm sure that's just my own backward upbringing reaching out and sullying my viewpoint.
"You don't know what gay shit is. Come over to my place, I'll show you some gay shit"
"I wear pink, like pink things, and even my hair is pink currently. I like reading, tea, baking/cooking, and toys. 

Still, I'm a 23 year old straight male. Imaging thinking liking a color or dressing certain way makes you gay. That's some small brain shit right there"
">a sign of homosexuality.

4 examples, you pick one very specifically (in that your criticism doesn't generalize to all the examples). And you're not even correct. Pink is an extremely common color on all kinds of men and more to the point, not all cross-dressing biologically male individuals are homosexuals."
Popular fashion has moved on. A lot of clothes are unisex now. There are lots of popular pink clothes made for men. Go outside once in a while.
I mean Idk. Something/someone is either gay or isn't. (Not looking at the whole sexuality is a spectrum idea here atm). I mean I wouldn't think that even a gay person would do what I described so who knows.
"Ah, I kindly appreciate your offer good sir! but I must reject it as the set of preferences that characterizes my well-beign does not include any of your gay shit"
"Well, of course pink is cosidered femenine! Even a toddler can see that! Its been used for decades as a depiction of feminine personality and feminine culture.

Having clarified that, I didnt said it’s bad, I said its gay shit refering to a male having female sterotypical personailty, on a side note, the act of adjectivizing such kind of personality as “gay” might had come from some wrong-thinking of the past were personality was linked directly with sexuality, but from where has come is not the point, as the present meaning of the expression is, which is what I presented above"
Pink used to be a masculine color and considered too bright for women you dork ass loser
And now it’s not!

"My job physically has in their handbook,  covering such events, about social media and such.   it's kinda cute when some one tries to cover it up and some one posts a screenshot of it."
"It's the same people who said ""don't believe everything you read on the internet"" and then post veritably false posts without do any any research whatsoever."

"No, the ""adults"" are not getting fired for posting racist posts."

its so true though
"ok, let's revise then:

1. Careful what you post online, it can follow you forever.
2. Don't be a racist asshole. 
3. ????
4. Is there a step 4? I forget. Something belongs here.
5. Me again, still haven't figured out what to do after step 3.
6. I mean, what the hell is step 3 anyway? 
7. Bottom line, don't be a racist asshole and learn a little empathy.
8. Try to be nice to people, avoid eating sugar, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."
I wish I could go back to 2007 and un recommend fb to my mom.  I feel like it's all my fault
Felt like it was barely ever the parents making those warnings it was articles from Millennials who realised better

I don’t get it? Is it really legal (in the US) to fire people because of their believes?!

*posts an article titled ""Democrats just banned being white and straight in California.""*"
"My mom will use that argument against me when I call out her bullshit ""facts"" that she learned from Facebook, lol. As if CDC, etc are wrong about COVID and other shit but some rando on FB knows all the facts.

Or she'll act like she knows my health problems better than I do and when I literally text her links to WebMD and similar sites, she'll say ""you can't believe everything you read online!"" as if she doesn't text me links to expensive-ass ""cures"" on obscure sites that she found online."
That a pretty ok amount of money
"If I had a dollar for every time my mom has been blocked on facebook because opposing our dumbfuck semi-dictatorian government here in Hungary, I would have quite a fortune.

Edit: also she's a teacher, and the govt likes to cut funds and fire headmasters so that they can give a governmental ~~agent~~ headmaster to the school"
I also know people that keep getting banned on reddit and continue to make alts. It takes a special kind of stupid
I got blocked by my cousin because I called her out on being racist and others agreed with me
"I remember talking to a coworker and this was before this police retardation took into a sad series of events.  I asked him if he had to, would he save his 94 year old racist granny or underwear from a burning house?  He replied really fast, he chose underwear because his granny had 94 years to learn to not be racist anymore."
that's actually quite impressive in a bad way
Don't let it sit in your account.. put it in hedge funds
What is she saying??
That’s a full gas tank and a car wash. Not too shabby
"Literally just got a text last night from my BIL that he's blocking my mom due to all the PraegerU racist bullshit she posts.

My husband and I hid her from our feeds years ago for stupid memes.

Now we have to have a talk with her about how she can be a white nationalist OR a grandma to our daughter, but not both.

Gonna be a good time."
If i goto a steak dinner i prefer to buy a premium steak dinner. I only do that every other year or so and the meat needs to melt in your mouth. So keep your mom posting (You need a side order also and need to tip)
"So from a German’s point of view, it is $32k (which is awesome) but hey, making even $32 is commendable."
"At a paltry $32, you probably wish it were $0. What's the threshold where you're thankful for the bounty your mom's racism provides?"
Oddly specific
It's not much but it's not honest.
suspiciously specific amount
"But if you gave **yourself** $32, wouldn't you technically have nothing?"
"instead of liking, my wife's grandmother Shares posts on facebook, she does this with every post that she sees, so facebook blocked her for a while because it thought she was a bot..."
That’s worth about a movie ticket and snacks here in northern NJ.
"Nah, what they meant was ""if you post risqué photos of yourself online you're a slut and we're going to judge you for it""."
"I mean, there are weird and dangerous people on the internet that kids and teenagers should not be talking with. People that will try to groom them or blackmail them. 

It would be dumb to cut them off from the internet for that but warning them to be wary is a good thing."
"Not really, there is still dumb shit that people post that would negatively affect a career."
"No, a whole bunch of parents believed that. In the AOL age there was no way to know if the other person on the other computer was a child predator. We wouldn't have half the safety measures we have now if it wasn't for that era of internets. Friends and family didn't exist online until Myspace. Gen X represent."
"> they just thought the internet was a scary new thing

Indeed.  
I can remember when my grandparents got their first computer.    
For the first few weeks all they did was turn it on, stand a distance away, and poke at it with a stick."
The only times I was told something like that was for posting about Tamir Rice or some other call for cops to quit being assholes
And now we are the ones being scared what has become of it
I'm a teenager and I don't have a single online account with my real name. I feel you.
Skankhunt?
Yeah I just started taking online college courses from a pretty good school and it's weirding me out that Blackboard uses my full first AND last name for discussion boards.
I created an nickname when I was 13 years old to play StarCraft online. I still use the same nickname to this day.
"My parents text me the ‘Facebook will make all profiles public and all photos will not be owned by you, I do not consent Mark Zuckerberg repost before midnight’ pish THROUGH TEXTS cause I deactivated my Fb account last year."

Apparently your dads the real pro gamer
"Just answer you don't get the joke and ask him to explain it to you every time he posts this shit. Forwarding a meme is easy, explaining it is funny because he is racist is something different."
"Lmao same, mine *emailed* me two random awful memes (he never emails, he can barely operate a computer outside of his conspiracy forums). I thought maybe it was spam but he confirmed he sent them. I was like wtf... he did have a mini stroke a few years ago so maybe I’ll just blame it on that."
"I like dark and edgy memes, but like stand up, you gotta know your audience. I’m not gonna send the offensive memes I find funny to people who it would obviously offend. That’s just being an asshole."
Block him and use his email to sign up for newsletters to progressive organizations
"That's the problem for me. Never had a Facebook account, but doesn't stop family sending me stupid shit. 

Racism and crazy conspiracies are the main talking points now with everyone above the age of 45 in my family."
"Ahah yep, not my dad, but mother and aunts."
"Facebook messenger scares me.  The messages cant be deleted ever, even if you delete your account.

10 years later I can re-read embarassing arguments where I was a dumbass losing my cool after getting friendzoned, and if I ever ran for Congress that girl could destroy my life.

Yes, I'm being candid, dont kill me.  We were all idiots once."

I guess I lucked out.   My parents only post pictures of their animals.  Racist memes come from people I went to highschool with.
Yea where are all these racists hiding?
My mom keeps posting karen memes and karen jokes. She works in food service so I guess she's just blowing off some steam?
"This is why I have a strict no-family policy on facebook. When I created my account, I found the profiles of all my relatives and blocked them before they could even know my account existed. And it's worked out great."
"I am forever thankful that my mother is too paranoid to be on Facebook.

Forever. Thankful.

"But what if my meme game is totally on point and I have a good meme restart, does that makes me *more* employable?"
"Good point about employment.  I will take it a step further. One of my friends from grade school became a cop. They have whole department that just looks through people's online profiles. Its Insane how many felons post pictures of themselves with handguns, then go to jail for it."
Why is this so far down.
"This sub started as people saying wild things on FB. Then it became half FB and half Twitter. Then it became mostly sociopolitical insanity. Then it became anything that leans right whether it’s expressly insane or not. Then it became anything sociopolitically right that had a zinger retort commented after it in a “murdered by words” fashion. Now we’re apparently landing on opinions that address hypothetical insanity without direct preamble. 

This sub started out as comedy but is just turning into masturbation. What’s really sad is that reading through these comments, all I’m really learning is that these commenters come from families of stupid and racist people, yet they’re generalizing all “old people” based on their own shit parents. My parents, aunts, uncles, friends parents growing up and all of their peers aren’t raving Facebook racists- but I guess these kids’ parents account for all old people, because you know- outside of racism, generalizing demographics based on a narrow personal sample is an intelligent and socially beneficial thing to do. The hypocrisy is so thick that my shoe stayed stuck in it while I was walking through here. 

Reddit is just gonna become the place that later millennials and early gen Z bitch about things when they’re old, after the younger people find new avenues to circle jerk and complain about their shit. It’s gonna be exactly what redditors see Facebook as now."

"Yeah. Just because they didn't heed their own warning doesn't mean it was a dumb warning. I was always taught to look both ways before crossing the street.

I only have one email address with my real name and its essentially my Alt account for college stuff
"I do both. I have a pseudonym, and I also post under my real name.

I'm quite conscious when I'm doing the latter - it's advertising. 

I _want_ future employers to 'google' me, find my positive and helpful contributions, and go 'hey, this is a guy we want to hire!'. 

It also keeps me aware that it _is_ attributable, so I don't stand up and say things I wouldn't be prepared to say in public, and have my employer or my mum know about."

Ultimately he will always conclude it's the US trying to undermine China so they can keep their strongest country of the world status. And even he admit China did something fuckee up but that's because they didn't have a choice of it's some individual incidents and we can't blame everything on the CCP. It's frustrating talking to him about politics. I studied abroad so my worldview is pretty westernized. SOMEONE PLEASE TAKE ME OUT OF MY HELLHOLE I CAN'T DEAL WITH THESE CHINESE IDEALS AND VALUES ANYMORE.
Your sentence is hard to understand. Adults are not people? What?
I dunno how old you are but once upon a time absolutely everybody was always warning of what you put online. Every single one of those people are the very same who share everybit of their personal lives on Facebook. No doubt about it.

Fr it's always stupid people that go around touting how smart they are
"Thinking you’re smarter than your parents, or anybody older than you, is the #1 symptom of being young. 

I feel bad for the kids in here who really do have legitimately ignorant parents spouting shit on facebook, but this thread also just reeks of youthful petulance and the brand of self importance that can only come from a lack of varied social experience."
"Proof?  How am I not smarter than my parents and all the kids of parents born between 1946 – 1964?

""Most"" (not all) people born between 1946 – 1964 can't even handle clickbait without going batshit crazy raging, like lunatics.  If you can't control your own thinking how is that intelligent?  It's no different than a slug.  Self awareness"

So she’s a good steak dinner amount racist
Where do you live that $32 gets you a good steak dinner? Unless you’re talking about buying and cooking the steak at home?
Eh.. maybe if you're cooking it yourself.
Or a beef
Not enough. Can i speak to your manager?
Don’t forget the tip
You from Argentina or something? lol
That’s a great value steak dinner.
The cheapest cut without drinks though.
"Without the whine, so sad. Howabout an okay steak dinner with cheap wine?"
Before tip with no wine.
Even with a marinade?
"I dunno, have you seen the price of beef lately?

But it is like gas in my car for like two weeks right now."
"32 bucks might get you an okay steak dinner, keep saving!"
Around $32

Also a fun story about ""Dolores Umbridge"":

A few years ago I was the behind the scenes photographer of a film shoot starring the Hungarian voiceover artist of Dolores. She is a great Hungarian actress and it was such an honour to work with her. But I have to admit that by hearing any single word she said just made my butt clench and my stomach shrink. Her voice is just the equivalent of authoritarianism in my head hahah."

Yeah exactly. At least here were just shaking our heads at the nonsense of it all. Whereas there it would people people i know and respected letting me down

I called BS on her snooty self-importance..... but I don't know how far the employee protection reaches. It was a job wholly unrelated to the correctional system."

You can. Just make a new account and abandon the old one. If anyone asks say you don’t really use it anymore.
That's sad man. Try to get out. Go to another country if you ever move out. First world countries like Finland and Switzerland are some of the best.

"Wait, are you really saying that you aren't objectively more educated than your parents?  How did they fuck that up for you?"
"I am definitely smarter than both of my parents.  But in context they're both awful people with on-and-off addictions, who had no hand in raising me and have each turned their own lives to shit.  I wouldn't say I'm smarter than my father's father, who raised me.

Some people probably get the impression that their parents' entire agegroup are stupid because they unfortunately happened to grow up having stupid parents who did stupid things.  I don't think it's necessarily because they're young, but more a lack of perspective based on individual experience that they feel applies across the board."
That’s why 20% of America’s population has 97% of its wealth and there are millions of Americans juggling between buying food or paying their light bill - if they even have a choice to begin with.
"I heard somewhere that if you gave every man's woman and child a quarter acre of land EACH, that 7 billion people could fit inside Australia and still leave Queensland to spare but I cba to do the maths...

EDIT: People seem to be misunderstanding the statement. I'm not saying everyone could live in Australia like that. I'm saying there is enough land in Australia alone to account for a quarter acre each, meaning there is plenty of space on the planet for the 7+ billion people."
"I don’t think so. A lot of the earth isn’t habitable or good for growing crops and livestock. We also want to preserve as much of the wilderness as possible if we like animals and plants and I really like animals and plants. The rich have too many kids anyway imo. Any time I hear about a rich person’s kids, they have like 5+. I just wish we could leave large parts of important land to other species, not develop it."
"The population is exploding at an exponential rate. **Exponential.** No matter how many resources you believe the world has, you _must_ agree there's a finite limit, which means this sort of growth can't continue for very long. 

Just because it's not a problem that will have serious consequences _during your lifetime_ does not mean we should ignore it."
"The carrying capacity of the Earth is a bit of an unknown value. We will hit the carrying capactiy of the Earth at some point, but that is assuming that there are no huge scientific breakthroughs that will allow us to increase the carrying capacity."

In Wisconsin you can get a legit steak dinner for $30 pretty easy. Cost of living is fairly cheap here though. Honestly to me $30 even seems too expensive to spend on one meal for dinner. My broke ass can’t afford that except for an anniversary or some shit. But when a really good paying job pays you $20/hour you can’t afford the finer things in life.

"I was technically a state government employee when I worked as a TA for a state university in Illinois. Ethics training each year reminded us that we *are* allowed to protest, donate, be active politically etc, but we could *not* do it on professional time or with professional resources or with anything identifying the university. So I could go protest but I’d better not skip work to do it or wear a university sweatshirt while I’m there. I could write a letter protesting a state/federal policy, but I couldn’t do it during the workday or using my university email/letterhead."
"Oh if I were to choose, I'm going back to New Zealand. I studied there. Love that beautiful place."
"I’m 40 and I don’t think I mentally turned 20 until I was over 30. I don’t think western culture is conducive to “growing up” at this stage in history. I think it ALLOWS people to grow up, but doesn’t FORCE them to grow up, or even coerce them if they weren’t already getting there by themselves. I think if you’re the type of person who would have a personally hard time growing up, modern western culture actually prohibits it. Most of it has become very self-excusing, and only demands attention when its trying to entertain you in order to sell you things, because marketing is what runs the west. If western culture found a way to sell marketing space through education, we would all be geniuses. You can trust me- I’m a 40 year old 23 year old."

There's lots of desert and unpopulated areas of Australia though. Most people live near the coasts.
"Australia have area of about 7.692.000km2. with 7 billion people, each person will have about 1100m2. So, a bit more than a quarter acre.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix


The Disposition Matrix, informally known as a kill list, is a database of information for tracking, capturing, ""rendering"", or killing suspected enemies of the United States.[1] Developed by the Obama administration beginning in 2010, it goes beyond existing kill lists and is intended to become a permanent fixture of U.S. policy.[1] The process determining criteria for killing is not public and was heavily shaped by National Counterterrorism Director and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John O. Brennan.[2]

Though White House, National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and CIA spokespeople have declined to comment on the database, officials have stated privately that kill lists will expand ""for at least another decade"", if not indefinitely. One official stated ""it's a necessary part of what we do"".[1] Paul R. Pillar, the former deputy director of the CIA's counterterrorism center, has stated, ""We are looking at something that is potentially indefinite"".[1]

The database's existence was revealed in a three-part series published by The Washington Post newspaper."

"Even the Food we get from Chinese restaurants isn’t actually Chinese. Or even very good, for that matter. I’d be more ok with it if the food was good quality, but barely fried ‘fried rice’, sweet dishes with a chili pepper symbol next to it and watered down sauces do not make for good ‘cuisine’. The best buffet I’ve been to is actually a 90 minute drive to get there, and it’s still  $15 per person. Rated as one of the best in my state, supposedly, and they have the kind of variety you are talking about also - sushi, Mac and cheese, and the same shit cake every buffet in the state seems to have"

That makes you overweight.... when you eat it with a steak. Way too many calories.
"My wife & I used to go to a gaming convention every year, and the hotel had a Ruth's Chris next door - we'd usually eat there and call it our anniversary dinner. I don't think we ever got out of there for less than $200, easily more if you're having cocktails."

"How clever.

Any president who's ever had to answer real questions or be held to account for something he did was treated worse than Trump.  He remains in an office that he bought with inherited money only because the entire Republican party has devoted itself to looking the other way every time he does something unbelievably asinine and/or obviously illegal.  And yet we have to listen to this childish whining on top of everything else... smfh
Ah yes I forgot this page turned into r/politics thanks shitty mods.
JFK got to finger an A-list film star and she didn’t even make him pay!!
Obama had it way worse. He was attacked daily for being African American. I know this to be true because every issue republicans attacked the man for our now praised by the same individuals. Truly disgusting and pathetic!
I didnt even have to read the bottom comment to know what the response was gonna be. Jesus fucking christ I dont think I've ever seen such a self obsessed narcissistic asshole in my entire life who thinks they have had it worse than JFK AND LINCOLN
Conservatives love acting like the victim so much.
Trump is the stupidest president of America ever and he keeps saying shit like this
He's just like a crying teenager who think he's the most miserable being on earth.
"It's not just the Democrats. My grandparents are super right wing, believe everything on Fox News Republicans and even they say someone needs to take away Trump's phone."
I was gonna say haven't like half a dozen US presidents been outright murdered?
I have seen this post so fucking much

Abraham Lincoln
Lol you realize everyone LOVED JFK right? Pretty sure if Trump is killed half the country will throw a damn party.
Ronald Reagan was almost assassinated twice
"Or Lincoln, or McKinley, or Garfield."
aww muffin!?!
Wasn't he part of the campaign that demanded to see Obama's birth certificate? He was literally part of that witch hunt.
"'This should never be allowed to happen to another president' sounds like he's planning something, y'all are about to have a dictator in your hands"
Frozen with fear or not working properly? To me just sounds like another excuse to justify his poor job
"Hello tweet from years ago, stop your karma craving op."
I don’t think he realizes that four presidents have been assassinated and there were attempts to kill Reagan and teddy Roosevelt.
More like a Bitch hunt!
JFK was opposed to the nuclearisation of Israel. Trump is in favor of expanding it.
That there’s IOU
"Yeah , the horse is also arrow proof."
Was JFK as unanimously and globally hated as much as Trump? He was killed by one man. Trump is despised by the entire planet.
I like how it's Dolan Dark doing the reply.
That cat isn’t visibly hurt by them.
>It is not for you squadW
I just wish it was anyone but Biden running against him.  They way he sniffs and kisses super young girls reminds me of a pedophile.  Write in Bernie I guess.
"Not really from what i know of the JFK incident most liked him where as the Orange trumpet with legs is hated by everyone especially the trans community after stripping them of civil rights (doctors can now refuse to treat trans people)

I just hope that America's next president 1 isn't trump and 2 fixes trumps fuck ups"
"How do you all know that just *being* him is not worse than death?

jk, jk"
JFK was loved by the media and the general public. It’s not ironic that Trump haters can’t even understand the point he is making without becoming irrational and twisting his words once again to fit their narrative. Whooooosh!
That whole punching nazis thing? It’s up?
"Only the Jews hated JFK for wanting to examine Israel’s nuclear weapons plants (for stolen American information) and for wanting to issue money backed by silver and gold. So they murdered him.

Then they tried to draw us into a war with Egypt by fire bombing one of our ships. Google “USS Liberty incident.”"
I mean technically JFK and Lincoln only had one bad day then got to retire. Trump has to survive the daily assassination of character.
Don’t forget about McKinley and Garfield!!
"If Trump wants to be in the same category of ""worst treatment towards a President"", how about he go see a show at the Ford Theater or take a drive by a book depository in Dallas? If history repeats itself,  he could work his way into the top 5."
To be fair they didn't have twitter back in the good ole days. I heard abe was a raunchy dude.

Have you really put a Donald Dank comment as a post on Clever Comebacks?  If this is allowed that this sub is shit.
Shot by a Democrat socialists. Funny how they now claim I am dangerous.
"Dems get nothing done... 

Yo Trump, look on Mitch’s desk, that’s where you’ll find all of the Dems work. 

Mitch is your problem or... are you misdirecting blame because you are incapable of taking criticism?"
Isn't the reason this is one of the least productive legislative administrations because the GOP controlled senate is essentially a graveyard? I think they've only really focused on passing new judges the last 4 years. Unless it was deregulation of some environmental or consumer protection law.
"Actually, there's probably no criminal that's been treated better."
Bitch. You are on Twitter all day. I wish we had a president that wasn’t so delusional and borderline and gave a genuine shit about our country.
Coming from the guy who said Obama is from Kenya because he's black
Dredging up a 9 month old tweet? Must be a slow news day.
The difference between JFK and Trump is Trump caved in when pressured by the Mafia and Russia. JFK didn’t.
What a whiny little bitch. Just like his fan club.
He is a weak minded person and bad leader. He is playing the victim but he is disregarded by many cause he is not the man for the job and not smart or equipped for the job. If he was intelligent he would say maybe I am not fit for the job but instead he just acts like a victim cause he is small minded and a very insecure and delusional man.
"How does a guy keep repeating the same things, over and over, nad over?   
Everything is ""the greatest"" that ""no one could believe.""   
How do sane adults not realize this guy is a moron?"
"Fellas Fellas, I hate Donald as much as the next guy (or girl), but we just add fuel to the conservative fire when we call him titles and qualities rather than pointing out WHY he's saying this trash.  If we point to his negligence to Covid and point to his repealing of Lgbtq+ protective laws, we make a bigger impact and lesson the effect these tweets cause"

Ronald Reagan was shot and he was a republican.
More TDS you say? Snooze
"That's true, the left hated JFK, and just like today, they were fucking unhinged"
Never have I ever seen or heard a president so badly ask for a pity party like a 15 year old girl does. Maybe if he were actually decent at at his job and not act like a complete imbecile that cares only about himself maybe he wouldn't be picked on so much. They even made wanted for treason posters for JFK which actually kinda foreshadows Trump today. Besides the anti-christian part. Idk what religion Trump is in or he even has one but I honestly don't care.

How many times will this be reposted.
Wouldn't it be awesome if they shot this one too tho?
This man is just begging for the Johan de Witt treatment.
Teddy Roosevelt got shot and finished a 90 minute campaign speech. We just need to see how Trump would fair in similar circumstances.
god why is he so full of himself
i dont understand how all the good presidents get assassinated but this doofus doesn't
god why is he so full of himself ?!
"I hear all of what your saying, but he has been slayed by the media constantly and any things of merit he’s done have gone ignored. So he ain’t been treated the worst cause he’s alive but besides that, it’s been rougher than most (and I’m a leftie!)"
"the reply is bullshit. JFK got shot at, yes, but that was one single act. Trump is indeed the victim of a witch hunt for more than 3 years"
I wouldn't say that yes JFK got assassinated but the way everyone treats this amazing president we have is discussing he does get a lot of hate
"For freeing millions from slavery btw meanwhile Trump is getting harassed because he has been accussed multiple times of sexual harassment, racism and a ton of others."
But he didn't wear a tan suit

Did I read that right?"
"The two bookends of Republican presidents couldn't be any more different. One was a self-made lawyer who was respected by everybody he met. The other is a trust fund baby who, if he's respected by somebody, it's basically a given that they don't actually know him."
"Other than that, how was the play, Mary?"
...and let's not forget President James Garfield who was shot & died after almost 3 months in hospital
"Okay, but in all fairness he was really enjoying the play up to that point."
"Actually he faked his death because he was dying of cancer anyway so they figured they might as well get some mileage out of it

And half his country waged war against him
"Trump is the party of Lincoln. Lincoln's suffering is his own. Trump freed all the slaves and all the left does is call him a racist nazi.

You know that shit is rolling around in his base's head."
Abe Lincoln deserved to be shot. He is the reason we have all this looting and BLM crazies. Go ahead and Tear down his statue.
"abe lincoln was racist, read his persnal correspondence."
And millions of people would be better off if Trump followed that example
"Trump is talking about treatment by the press, not treatment by nutjobs wielding guns."

"Not to mention the way that much McConnell refused to compromise on any legislation with him and was more than willing to just let America shut down if he needed to constantly. 

Democrats at least drafted bills. Mitch just won't let anyone vote on them."
"I remember there was a whole thing about him not being born in the US just because he wasn't white and even after he produced his birth certificate, they continued to spread lies about him. One of the key figures in that movement was some reality TV star if I remember correctly. Not sure what happened to him."
Muh birth certificate
And the media sucking his dick raw.

"The legislation to create the secret service was on lincoln's desk the night he was shot. And it wouldn't be until two presidential assassinations later that they would be tasked with presidential protection.


Do you think Trump would still be around today if there was no secret service?"
"I really don't think it's going to be that easy. What dictator just leaves office because they got voted out. Trump is literally going to have to be dragged out of the Oval Office kicking and screaming like the little bitch he is. It's going to be scary this Nov, there is no way he's going out without a fight and he will use every evil trick in the Dictators Playbook to stay in power. You think it was bad when he said the election was fixed when he won, well just wait till he loses!"
"Wow ,I didn‘t have to boot licker"
He acts and thinks like 99% of other rich people in this country...

Then scroll past it.
"He's saying that he is the victim of a witch hunt, not calling for one."
"I thought Nixon rammed through the civil rights bills?

JFK had the stones to stand up to the Russians over nuclear missiles in the Caribbean that could wipe out most of the eastern seaboard of the US, not get down on his knees and suck Putin off like Trump and Moscow Mitch apparently do."
Not for same reasons as JFK or Abe
"Very unlikable, didnt really connect with average citizens, collapsed during a campaign appearance, shown to be all politics and not ""for the people"" at all. Several big lies exposed. Trump really took advantage of her well known past to win swing states"
And now you’re on a list.
"SCOTUS took care of LGBTQ stuff yesterday. 

Trump claimed he read the opinion. It was over 160 pages long. I’m sure he didn’t get past the first page."
"Holy shit
I know trumps bad, but you are literally agreeing with high-level assassination.

Advocating violence on someone you don't like, makes you no different than the orange man."
"We didn’t have to. Democrats and Republicans should trade Presidents. You kill JFK and his brother and we get to kill Trump and Kushner. 

Fair is fair right? If only Republicans didn’t assassinate JFK....."
Trump picked a fight with the media literally calling them the enemy of the people.  He started a war of words armed with a syllable and gets butthurt because his lies and cons are called out.  He's been treated absolutely fairly based on his behavior but to his spoiled sensibilities that's persecution.  He is a piece of shit and he gets treated as such.
No he's not a victim. You trump snowflakes just love to say that. He's a narcissistic sociopath who continuously acts and does narcissistic things. Of course the media is going to target that. He's a complete fucking idiot when ever he speaks it's an embarrassment. He has a cult of followers like you who only pretend to be conservative. He couod come out as a democrat tomorrow and you would be cheering him on. Let's not even get started on the illegal shit he has done or been accused of. Just his narcissistic sociopath personality would already have been enough for the media to glue themselves to.
"Lol, asking him to go defend himself is the literal opposite of a witch hunt, you nut."
Care to elaborate? Cant help but feel like he sticks his foot in his mouth on a daily basis.
Not without reason
"Serious question, Can you name 1 amazing thing he has done??"
He’s a tool. Not my president
He is not my President
What great things has trump done while president?
"Which goes to show just how bad his people skills are.

&#x200B;

like it or not, A president is the official face of a country, yes he makes some decisions but he is also that country's scapegoat if anything goes wrong during his presidency regardless of whether he is responsible for causing it or not AND one of his key tasks is to be able to handle public relations and avoid international incidents and overall public outrage.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately for Trump, regardless of how good or effective his policies might be, he lacks the basic human skill and charisma required to do all the public presidential stuff, this means that he lacks the skills required for him to do this job.

&#x200B;

He is quite literally not competent enough for the job and the only reason why he got elected wasn't because people wanted to elect him but because he was the one people didn't want to be elected the least which if this is how elections work, you have a HUGE problem with the system.

&#x200B;

Its like marrying the guy you hate the least rather than the guy you love."
"Don't forget the diddlings, misuse of financial institutions, illegal political dealings"
It’s accused aswell as settled out of court.
Lol and BLM is coming for Abe too
He's being attacked by the left for the FIRST STEP act
And he’s never heard of Dijon
didn't technically he violate the constitution by not allowing the states to secede?
A great president*
I'm going to pretend I understood that
Is there a chance he will lose his seat in November?? How he finds anyone to vote for him is beyond me.
McConnell was (is) such an obstructionist that *he filibustered his own bill* when democrats got behind it...
I wish
"Accusing him of being a Muslim from Kenya is not ""just not liking what he was doing""."
"It was definitely a component of it but, not everything. He was a young, charismatic, popular liberal politician. Conservatives hate those"
"Lol. Called Kenyan instead of being from the US.

You don't think that had to do with the fact he was black?"
"Sure, buddy. I always wonder who you conservatives are trying to convince, yourself or others."
Well Floridaman’s not there like in waze
"Americans were lynching effigies of him during protests. 

It was the kind of shit you saw in the Middle East when they were burning Bush effigies, except this time it was white Americans doing it to their own president because their blind rage and racism helped them believe he was a Kenyan-born Muslim socialist who was setting up FEMA death camps in order to enact Sharia Law. 

Even before he won the election in ‘08, the rumors that he wasn’t born in Hawaii were spreading, but the second he won, an entire propaganda machine went into motion to convince every racist asshole who’d listen that he was born in Africa. 

And, of course, Trump was instrumental in reigniting that rumor in 2011, after it had died down some."

"Yeah, but the media’s super fucked with their own corporate and other agendas so he’s right that they’re not for the people. And he has unrelenting called them out on it so has been slayed. He is a narcissistic megalomaniac who fires shit off on a whim, but ww3 never happened from it, so never I got why people didn’t embrace he’s anti establishment possibilities. Cause he’s fucking with it. And that’s why they hate him"
"> No he's not a victim. You trump snowflakes just love to say that. 

At least take the L when it's deserved. You snowflakes have been gobbling up bombshells after bombshells for three years straight and still have no self-awareness to stop believing the nonsense that media peddles.

The hysteria about Rs protesting the covid bans vs. BLM protests, you guys are idiots Americans, controlled slaves to the media."
Trumptards never answer you when you ask this question and if they do it is always based from misinformation.
"I agree with your sentiment but lots of people voted for him knowing full well what their vote was for. They wanted a racist, sexist, homophobic bigot who is bigly smart."
"I never understood wind. I know windmills very much, I have studied it better than anybody. I know it is very expensive. They are made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none, but they are manufactured, tremendous — if you are into this — tremendous fumes and gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right spewing, whether it is China or Germany, is going into the air. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off, that is true. By the way, they make you turn it off. And yet, if you killed one, they put you in jail. That is OK. But why is it OK for windmills to destroy the bird population?"
"Americans voted for Trump because of how he was portrayed on the tv show ""The Apprentice.""

The show is edited to make him seem tough and in charge and mostly old people who still watch tv vote while young people do not vote.

Also a lot of old white people are super racist and loved his birtherism conspiracy theory.  Sure a lot of the electorate didn't like Hillary but just look at what's going on now with Trump supporters.  They worship him like a God.  The 2016 election was definitely way more about how much old white people love Donald Trump and hated Obama than they disliked Hillary."
Attacked? Where? How?
"No, I think the states don't have the right to secede, at least not anymore."
except for the pedophilia business
"McConnell, the head of the Senate majority under Obama, refused to compromise on any legislation. He also made it clear that his goal was to prevent Obama from doing anything. That's part of the reason Obama had to sign so many executive orders. 

Now we have a Democratic House of Representatives. They've drafted and passed over 250 pieces of legislation that they've sent to the Senate for a vote. McConnell has refused to vote on any of them."
"In short, Bitch Mcconell is a racist whore"
"From 2011-2014 the US senate had a Democratic majority but was short of the 60 cloture vote minimum, meaning some Republicans would have to vote with democrats to pass things. They largely didn’t at the behest of McConnell even though they were heavily compromised bills that have Republicans a lot of what they wanted. McConnell and Ryan would usually take turns being “the bad guy” who’d table important legislation that the other chamber passed so that they split the flack. Then, after the 2014 elections the GOP took over the senate and would just flat out not vote on bills period because for some absurd reason, the senate majority leader has the power to kill any bill he or she wants (with some exceptions like votes for an impeachment trial). The whole idea of putting things to vote and proposing laws is to get elected officials on record voting for or against bills and holding them accountable for it, but senate republicans have this nice deal going on rn where they can pretend to support something without having to face consequences for it because big bad Mitch won’t let the vote happen."
An average American response...
"He's polling neck and neck with his changer, and donations are flooding in from out of state. Still, if the Koch twit wants to toss in 79 million, he can, and he won't even remotely miss it"

I was going to agree with you but your history is giving me some serious high school shooter vibes.
"To be faaaaairrr, Trump’s babbling is often subject to interpretation.   That’s why so many of his supporters tend to twist themselves into pretzels to explain what he *really* meant."
"Yep, I was correct. No difference."
"You sound more like an astroturfing operative than a supposed leftie.  Trump fawned over fox until they even slightly criticized him and now promotes OANN, two of the most agenda driven and corporate 'news' entities out there.  He doesn't do anything for the people because as you said he's a narcissistic megalomaniac, a true piece of shit, and that's why no one is open to his possibility, he's demonstrated time and again that he has no spine, no morals, no intelligence, and no loyalties.  He is hated because he spews hate, lies, and destroys everything he touches.  Not starting WW3 is the lowest bar possible and has repeatedly pushed us to the brink domestically and internationally."

I was joking that trump is a civil rights legend
"I don't think they fully resolved that issue at that time which was the whole reason Andrew Jackson was never tried for treason. Cause they didn't want to open up the legality of secession, and the legality of the war since congress never officially recognized the confederacy as a nation, which is actually how Lincoln went to war without getting congressional approval.

Imo Lincoln did the morally right thing, but he violated the fuck out of the constitution.

But, I'm not a history buff, this is just like passive information from random history channel stuff and some random articles I half remember.

Though since the war the supreme court has said secession is illegal iirc. Which doesn't seem like something the founding fathers would have wanted."
" Dubious legality of unilateral secession. The Constitution does not directly mention secession. ... The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Constitution to be an ""indestructible"" union. There is no legal basis a state can point to for unilaterally seceding


Source: Trust me bro 

Jk it's Wikipedia

So it's not illegal it's just seen as the constitution holds all the states together but we saw how that went during the Civil War 

Edit: I forgot the last little section"
Oh ok. Thank you for explaining it
Is there any nice source to summarize his vote on all these proposals? Genuinely curious.
well at least he makes it easy on the democrats so that they don’t have to rewrite the bill when the senate turns blue in 2020
That's a nice slogan
Going Neck and Neck with a Turtle never ends well. Are out of state donations legal?
"You might learn faster thanks to your genes but it's not a big deal, you won't be a genius because of your family."
"Any belief I may have had in such a theory is well and truly gone when I consider how smart an MIT prof has to be vs. how stupid a nephew can be. I think it's more like an intellectual parent will try harder to raise an intellectual kid because they value it that much more. Genetics may factor in how well one's mind can learn and process information, but it's not a case of genetic predisposition only. A kid can have parents of so-so (or less) intelligence and still surpass them just pushing himself/herself, and, conversely, a smart Fred can have a not-that Don."
You just rephrased nature vs nurture.
"Dude, I’m out of my depth with OANN stuff but will look into that stuff now. I’m no ‘astroturfing operative’ whatever the fuck that is, just a human that’s always been left leaning but who’s wondering wtfs going on and looking at everything a bit more critically. Good chat though, seriously."

And above average follow through. Props on learning!
"Which proposals? If you're referring to his legislative graveyard, there's no vote because he refuses to hold one. If you're referring to obstructing Obama, he happily declared it as his goal on television."
"I believe the Congress website actually has a nice ""Tracker"" for the status of bills they've passed. Many, many, many are at the ""Awaiting Senate"" stage."
Well these are house bills and there will be a new house so they will need to be re sent
I know. I’m surprised he ran on that. Ballsy move.
"Yup We very, very much need reform, but the only way to do that is for us to pass campaign finance reform in all 50 states, since they have final say on this sort of thing."
"You mentioned good that he’s done going without
merit....
As a canadian I’m not super familiar with everything trump does, but he sure does look like a dumpster fire from here, what good has he done that you feel he isn’t being credit for?"

"Cool, I will try to find them when I have time. Also may I ask what does ""refuse to hold a vote"" mean? Is it just ""not voting for""?"
Not in Kentucky
He's not initiating the process so the vote doesn't happen. So no one votes.
"As the head of the senate, he is the one that actually initiates the voting process. Therefore, he can simply refuse to let the senate vote on something, even if all other 99 senators would vote for it.

I believe there's some sort of mechanism to force a vote, but I'm not American and not all that familiar with the minute details of how it works."
Is this part of the United Kingdom of Albania
"Essentially the leader of the House and Senate decide what the House or the Senate will vote. The Democrat led House has passed many bills, but they still need to be passed in the Senate before they can go to the President to be signed into law or vetoed. McConnell doesn't bring them up to vote, because he doesn't want the Republicans to have to go on record voting against the nation's interest. Essentially they just die in the ""Senate Graveyard"" because McConnell clearly has no interest in having a vote on them. 

Currently there must be hundreds of bills in that graveyard. Some I remember are digital election security, pension safeguarding and 9/11 hero benefits."
"There are a handful of things that can be put to vote by any member of the body. Voting on new legislation is not one of those things. It's mostly procedural stuff.

If literally all 99 other Senators wanted to vote for something and the Majority Leader refused to schedule a vote, they'd use one of the procedural things to select a new Majority leader. Majority Leader isn't an elected position with a set term, it's chosen by the other Senators. The other Senators can un-choose him at literally any time. 

McConnell is not some rogue agent who has taken over and corrupted the Senate singe-handedly. He's in charge because the other Republican Senators want him to be in charge. It would take only four Republican Senators to vote with the Democrats to remove him as Majority Leader."
This is the most important thing to realize. ALL GOP SENATORS ARE BLOCKING VOTES. MCONNEL IS THE NAME BUT THEY HAVE ALL DECIDED HE SHOULD AND ARE HAPPY HE IS. They all need to be removed and most imprisoned for their roll in treason and conspiracy against the United States they have enabled by supporting Trump. ALL OF THEM VOTED NOT TO REMOVE. They know what and how he did it and the entire party is trying to help him do it again in 2020.

You can have satisfying sex even if you have a micropenis. You just have to find a way that works for both of you. Don't let toxic masculinity get into your head.
"No it’s not. She didn’t say racism means you have a small dick. 

It means you have the energy and confidence of someone with a small penis. 

Plenty of dudes with small penis have big dick energy. But sure, make what the woman says about racism about your penis."
I am not racist
Yea but  racism is flat chest energy is mean though
"Even with a smol dick you can have big dick energy. It's all about your presence and confidence. 

You know they thing that guys with smol dicks don't have... Wait shit I fucked up..."
"Just in case this isn’t sarcasm... “big/small dick energy” isn’t actually about anyone’s physical member. It’s a commentary on the confidence/presentation/action of another person (e.g. big dick = magnanimous; small dick = withholding). 

You have have no dick and have big dick energy.

I will grant you that it plays into an unfair pressure on men and it’s absolutely worth talking about that. You’re right in that we should really consider how hurtful words can be, particularly about bodies."

"NA, only the ones with nice tities"
Did u see the tits on her tho?
"Alternatively, just view the image and move on like a normal person who is either past 15 or has realized the internet has pornography free of charge."
She is taking about dick?
Does he smell good?
But this is a big tiddy goth gf
She’s holding up a sign talking about small dick energy...
"What would happen if I google her name? I'll unzip my pants, just in case"
"It's not. Not gonna post her Insta here but nah, she's an aerialist performer not a porn star / cam girl."
"Once you go Big Mac, you don’t"
It’s probably like a Cat-Mammal thing IE all racists have small dicks but not all people with small dicks are racists.
"All racism is small dick energy, but not all small dick energy is racism"
You need to review how Venn diagrams work.
She didn't say small dick energy means you're racist
Small dick energy and having a small dick are not mutually exclusive attributes. You can have a tiny dick and still exude big dick energy by respecting women and not being a fuckin racist.
Guess I’ll say the N-word

Sounds like you've got a small wee wee
I mean yeah... But we're horny teens and you showed us an attractive person. We gotta get it out of our system somehow.
yeah you need to take a long hard look in the mirror if you’re in the half that ISN’T commenting on the fat tits of an attention whore lmao
"You're gonna get tanked. I'm gonna guess -9


Though you make a very very valid point and you were the first to do so. It's ok saying small dick, bad saying someone is overweight. Bad saying they're not attractive. Bad saying they're old. Not bad saying they've got a small dick.



It's even bad saying they are attractive now by some weirdo redditors that think the world started in 2003"
But body shaming men is in.
"My friend found one! He's a British guy, went on a dating site and put America in and boom.


She's big in general but she's super nice, just like him and I'm telling you that's a huge rarity. It's like magic.



They're married now, just got a green card in progress I assume."
Sorry for the downvotes. I will never be able to guess what gets up- or downvoted.
"P => Q does not necessarily mean Q => P

Racism => Small dick does not necessarily mean Small dick => Racism."
That's racist against people with small PPs
Oh no a joke about memes. Everyone knows memes are just for men and women can't enjoy humor!
"And they say shit like ""Well she knew what she was doing wearing clothes that made her look hot"". I'm sorry, who goes out everyday with the intention of making themselves look like shit?"
Projecting? You made some sort of comment referencing the girl...
Attractive? Wow.
You can have smol pp and still have big dick energy
Small dick energy isn't about your size. It's about how you use it
Make it a thing. I request you.
"I probably shouldn’t be laughing at this, but this was sodding hilarious"
Thicc
People I’m America are immune to warmth. That’s the only viable explanation.

Not being racist is big dick energy you just gotta believe in that

True!
But admitting you have a small dick is big dick energy though.
Nothing about America is healthy. It has just taken the rest of the world a while to realize this because we've got great propaganda.
Personally it’s only unhealthy if you let it bother you. Words only have power if you give them power.

"Using any kind of ""dick energy"" is body shaming because it's inherently reliant upon the idea that small dicks are bad. Saying ""guys with small dicks can have big dick energy"" is basically telling them that them actually having a small dick is a bad thing, while pretending it's a compliment."
You aren’t over compensating
You mean you are only realizing how the rest of the world views you due to your propaganda
Now apply that language to racist language.

"It's not *body* shaming, it's shaming an insecure attitude. That's why it's small/big dick *energy* and not just saying someone has a small or big dick.

Yeah good point. I don't agree with the poster she is holding either.

https://imgur.com/t/mac/S9wwG"
Nazi sympathizers in Sweden
"Sweden : sorry about the guns made by Swedish iron , and the tanks. Also sorry for supplying the nazi soldiers, and allowing nazis to move through our country. Oh, and sorry for allowing German airplanes into our country. We cool ?"
This would've been a magical moment between those two soldiers. Think about the battles that Norwegian would've had to have fought it to liberate his country while his Swedish friend was likely standing guard as always.
I thought Sweden was am Axis power.
"Not officially but Norwegian fighters where left to operate fairly freely in Sweden. There was a large contingent of Norwegian refugees in Sweden and they set up organizations with  lines of communication back to the government in exile in Britain.

In order to maintain their Neutrality Sweden didn't allow military operations based from their territory at first and they sometimes turned away refugees caught on the border, but the Norwegians where allowed to train a ""police force"" and from 1943 onward they took a more Allied friendly approach and allowed Norwegians in Sweden to train military units and even launch operations from Swedish territory and smuggle weapons, by the end of the war there where 14.000 Norwegian soldiers based in Sweden. Although they never saw battle they allowed the Norwegian government to swiftly move in and take custody of surrendering German troops and arrest collaborators once German forces surrendered at the end of the war."
"Some Swedish volunteers went straight from the Winter War to the Battle of Narvik. 

Not many though.

As it became clearer that Germany was losing Sweden took a more open stance against the Germans. 

By the end of the war, Sweden was training and equipping several units of ""police troops"" for IIRC both Norway and Denmark, plans were drawn up to rescue our neighbors if Germany decided to fight to the end, but as they surrendered, that did not become necessary."
"In the mid-1980s, it was revealed that Sweden aided the Norwegian resistance movement with training and equipment in a series of camps along the Norwegian border. To avoid suspicion, they were camouflaged as police training camps. By 1944, some 7,000–8,000 men had been secretly trained in Sweden."
"Sweden assisted Norway. But only after it was clear Germany would lose the war. In the first year, they even sent Norwegian refugees back to go into German prisons. It was pretty nasty."
"It is complicated. Sweden sold iron ore and other materials to the germans and did not accept the Norwegian royal family when they left Oslo. 

It should be noted that many individual swedes did support Finnish troops against Soviet aggression against Finland. Numbers were not massive but about 10k troops and 28 aircraft. Considering that Finland was traditionally Swedish territory for hundreds if years, there were close support for Finland as well, ""indirectly"" supporting the Nazis after the beginning of the Eastern War (Arguably this was nearly a separate conflict). Like all western countries there were Nazi like support in society at the outbreak of the war, though they were a small minority. Culturally Germany was a much closer than the Anglo sphere as a point of power and the second language most spoken in professional disciples like medicine and law. 

What is often forgotten however is how bad the Swedish defence situation was at the time of the war. Successive left wing governments since 1932 did not invest remotely enough in defence despite rising tensions. At the outbreak of the war southern sweden had one small defence battery to defend the vitally important Öresund straight (near Copenhagen). 

As such there is little Sweden could do to deal with the organized professional German Army. By managing to be neutral Sweden was able to massively build up defences and by the end of the war was actually in a position to do something about the Germans. At least an invasion would be costly. In southern sweden a huge string of fortifications were made to defend the coast and project power into Öresund. Norwegian freedom fighters moved into sweden for relative safety to regroup and escape when necessary. 

So it is a mixed complicated bag. The issue for me isnt that we didnt do anything and we supported the nazi government but that we were so poorly prepared that we had no choice but to support them. You build an army not to have it in good times but to have it when times turn bad."
"Sweden assisted and helped all neighbouring countries(Denmark, Finland and Norway) during the war and the Nazis at the same time, it's the way of neutrality."
"we had a bunch of volunteers helping, even a col. lieutenant from Sweden fell in my hometown of Salla/Kuolajarvi."
"I know Sweden took in parts of the Norwegian royal family for a time. They trained people from Denmark and Norway and sent them back to Norway to fight. However Sweden also helped Germany, they let them use their airbases and allowed them passage to Finland to invade Russia. Sweden also sold weapons and iron to both sides during the war.

Sweden was neutral in the sense it helped both sides and profited but once things started going poorly for Germany they cut ties with the axis powers and helped the allies."
"I have recently finished reading a book about the early stages of the war, Blitzkreig by Zitterling. He mentions aid given by Swedish volunteers during the initial invasion against the Germans."
"We also helped the nazis 'til the very end.


I'm ashamed of Sweden's lack of spine in WW2"
"Some youtuber did a history piece named something like 'could sweden have resisted a German invasion during wwII' 

Although not specific to how sweden helped Norway, it did shed some light on how and why Sweden was never invaded by the Germans."
"Sweden played a vital part for Norway's resistance. It was used as a safe haven for resistance fighters and also as a safe place for refugees to flee to. 

Sweden also trained 15.000 Norwegian refugees and armed in secret training camps in Sweden:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_police_troops_in_Sweden_during_World_War_II


Norway presented Sweden with Voksenåsen on 2 October 1960. Voksenåsen is the nation's gift to Sweden for the help the Norwegians received from the Swedes during the Second World War. Norway gave away a small part of their own country as a gift to Sweden. 
It is wholly owned by the Swedish state and today operates as a center for Swedish-Norwegian cooperation and as a conference hotel with a restaurant.

https://www.sfv.se/en/fastigheter/utrikes/europa/voksenasen-oslo-norway/"
"This is still debated, many swedes helped save the lives of norwegian resistance fighters, others turned them over to the police, who in turn handed them over to the germans. 

German soliders invaded Norway by train through Sweden, and the swedish princess was photographed when she handed out chocolate and other wares to wounded german soliders being transported back from the front in Norway, through sweden.

Sweden allowed the germans to tap in to their telegraph lines that the Norwegian forces also used to coordinate their resistance, with a devastating effect.

The norwegian princess and children even had to ram the swedish border patrol in order to escape into Sweden, as they were refused entrance. Even though she is of swedish descent.

My grandparents lost friends that tried to seek refuge in Sweden during the war, and they never forgave them. Those were different times, and it is easy to judge them through modern eyes. Many things were plain wrong, but many things were done to save swedish lives. 

I can recommend the book ""Mein lieber Reichskanzler!"" by the swedish author Staffan Thorsell."
The military aid to Finland was larger than the annual Finnish national budget.
"Swedish state sold iron ore to Germans, because they were too afraid to decline and fight. They just took the profits and closed their eyes (they were, in many ways sympathetic to the nazi ideology - Sweden had their own racial ""research programs"")

Swedish volunteers aided both Finland and Norway. 

Today the Swedes always bring up this part, but in reality it was not very much."
"I don't, yuck."
Colorized work most probably
The colorizing is masterful work to be honest.

"It's one of those things you can't ever unsee after doing any amount of time in an army. The lack of gun discipline among virtually anyone who ever picks one up, including the dude in this pic, is just ugh...


It's drilled in you 24/7 in basic training, and even after that-- do not EVER let the barrel of your gun point at ANYONE who is not the enemy. Do not even let it happen accidentally, which is what seems to be happening in this picture. 


The amount of times people who've been accidentally shot due to negligence and lack of discipline... is probably higher than those who have been intentionally shot. Mind blowing, I know. It seems like one of those things that should be easy... but then again we still have people who think the earth is flat... or chocolate milk comes from brown cows, the depths of human stupidity is limitless."

Norway were dragged into the conflict and stayed neutral like Sweden before they got invaded.

"Do you know what neutrality means? We also spied on the germans and shared intelligence with the british, let the allies use our air bases, helped many refugess flee the german concentration camps and help train soldiers for liberation of Denmark and Norway.

"Sweden, the Cambodia to Norway's Vietnam.

I know, I know, not at all, but I wanted to savour that mental image for a moment."
My grandfather was actually training as part of the police force
"The headquarters of the Norwegian navy in exile was located at my town hall in South Queensferry, wee fact I'd thought I'd throw in there. There was also the Shetland bus which helped supply the resistance https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_bus#:~:text=The%20Shetland%20Bus%20(Norwegian%20Bokm%C3%A5l,Germany%20on%208%20May%201945."
"Well, we were completely isolated, what with the whole Soviet pushing into Finland thing, and Germany taking Denmark/Norway, and the Allied *and* Axis blockades. We had to agree to *some* things to avoid invasion (and get food and coal), though we also prevented as much as our government thought was possible.  
  
We also gave Germany access to our phone/telegraph lines and tapped them. Arne Beurling deciphered the *Geheimfernschreiber*, and *Ericsson* built T52 analogues to decode the messages (Beurling providing the settings). The decyphered messages were then sent to the Allies through the Polish resistance movement.  
  
Swedish intelligence helped in the sinking of the Bismarck, by providing intelligence on when and where it left port. Some Swedish businessmen and diplomats acted as Allied spies, or as ""neutral"" go-betweens when the Axis and Allied needed to pass messages to each other (Himmler tried to surrender to Folke Bernadotte, for example, who declined but forwarded the peace proposal to the Allied leaders), or worked to help free Jews and other captives."
">if Germany decided to fight to the end

They basically did within Germany, and then they surrendered"

The classical Swedish approach, adjust position based on how the wind blows. Still holds true to this day. Might be a good survival strategy, but lacks  basic principles."
"Yeah. *Police* training camps.

These Norweigean *policemen* just happened to be equipped with the same gear as a Swedish infantry batallion - including machine guns, mortars, grenades and everything else a norweigean *policeman* might need."
"Don't forget aiding the German invasion by allowing sealed German trains carrying ""medical supplies"" (soldiers and weapons) to travel via the Swedish rail network to get to Northern Norway.This greatly helped German efforts in the north, as the logistics of moving supply into the mountainous region was difficult due to terrain and the British naval power blocking sea access. 

Then again, they did provide safe refuge in the later years, and even helped train and arm exile Norwegians to act as police troops in the retaking of Norway. 

A mixed bag in other words. Seeing as the rest of Europe was falling rapidly, it's understandable that Sweden tried to play both sides until it became obvious which way the war was turning. Sweden was also dependent German coal exports."
Source?
"Also, important to note: the swedish-norweigan border was demilitarized according to treaty from dissoulition of the union. Combined with poor infrastructure, this meant swedish forces having great difficulties securing the border, at a time when it seemed certain the germans would continue into sweden as soon as norway was beaten."
"""It is known that at least 15,000 Swedes volunteered to fight alongside the Finns, with 10,000 accepted for training and 8,000 actually went to Finland in organised units before the war ended, which can be compared to the largest contributor to the International brigades, France, during the entire Spanish Civil War. In addition, a smaller number of individuals joined the Finnish army units or operated mechanical shops repairing equipment, mainly in the Swedish speaking south of Finland. The Swedish government and public also sent food, clothing, medicine, weapons and ammunition to aid the Finns during this conflict. The military aid included:[4]

135,402 rifles, 347 machine guns, 450 light machine guns with 50,013,300 rounds of small arms ammunition;
144 field guns, 100 anti-aircraft guns and 92 anti-armour guns with 301,846 shells;
300 sea mines and 500 depth charges;
17 fighter aircraft, 5 light bombers, 1 DC-2 transport aircraft turned into bomber, and 3 reconnaissance aircraft, totally comprising 1/3 of the Swedish air force at the time.""

"If we assume a German landing attempt before Norway fell, the Swedes could have stopped that with their navy, as, while the Germans had better ships, the Swedes had enough ships themselves that they could deny most of the landings (they also have the benefit that a naval invasion of Sweden is far harder to disguise as an invasion of Norway, so they should know that it would be coming). 


In the places were landings would happen those would be too small to reinforce for the Germans (especially as they would lose enough naval forces to make a naval resupply impossible) and so could be stopped by the Swedish army, which was in a far better state than the Norwegian one."
[deleted]
"> Sweden also helped Germany, they let them use their airbases  
  
I can't find any source for Sweden having allowed Germany to use Swedish air bases? Only for allowing them to pass through Swedish airspace, or at least Germany demanding they do, as part of what was the Midsummer Crisis, and in order to help our neighbours Finland."
"Yes, after it was clear the Germans would lose.
Lots of Norwegians were sent back from Sweden during the early years of the war."
"I think it was rather genius tbh. They were essentially an arms dealer for both sides. All the profit, none of the expenses"
"When Germany invaded Denmark/Norway, most pro-german sentiment in Sweden more or less evaporated overnight. 

It's hilarious that you speak of profits as if life was all fine and dandy. The war caused massive shortages in Sweden and the combined allied/axis blockade of the north sea left us with very few options regarding who we could actually trade with - especially since Sweden at the time was reliant on the import of fuel, coal and food."

"It's cherrypicking and only really tells half the tale which gets annoying when it's parotted over and over and it ignores two big pointers; Sweden needed German imports, the war was causing all sorts of shortages in Sweden and to make up for those we need to trade something in return. Secondly, iron ore was not considered contraband at the time, so it was legal - I'm not proud of it, ethically it was wrong of us to do, but with the British blockade and the german minefields it's not like we had much choice when it came to trading partners and again - at the time Sweden relied on those imports. Fuel, coal and food being the big 3 as far as I can remember.

No it wouldn't have. They couldn't import by sea ( britania rules the waves ). They Soviets stopped supplying after barbarossa( **insert soviet music here**). They had shortages inspite of Swedish iron. It would have saved lives of sweden had morals about this and didn't bend over backwards to help the Germans.

Standing by while the Nazis invade all of Europe and genocide 11 million odd people....?

Sweden's strategy was ""Let's not risk any of our shit because there'll hopefully be someone bigger and stronger who can come and risk *their* shit"". Entire country should be ashamed."
">Do you know what neutrality means

I know what neutrality doesn't mean. Letting the german army march through your country into norway. Watching your neighbours and Allies be invaded. Letting millions perish.

You did not help in the liberation of norway, the only part that was liberated before the end of the war was done by the Soviets. 

Neutrality doesn't mean cooperation. Switzerland was neutral. Sweden was helping the nazis, untill it became evident that the nazis wouldnt win."

"Please stop referring yourself as ""we"" when talking about past incidents where you had no presence."
It is easy to have principles when the enemy isn't on the other side of one of the longest land borders in Europe.
A classic since the 1900s or something mayhaps.
"Sweden, natures weathervane."
"You have to keep in mind that by this time the Ministry of Police in Norway was being run by the SS, who had just finished militarizing their newly acquired police force in Norway after installing the Fascist party of Norway to operate it.  That's another thing, Germany wasn't directly occupying Norway, they overthrew the government and installed the Fascist Party of Norway to help them rule.

On top of that, for several years prior, the SS had been ordering the construction of police barracks and multiple SS institutions all around the country.  Ergo the autonomous construction of police training centers made in Fascist likeness on the border didn't raise any red flag for them.  Norwegian policemen, directed by the Fascist Party, were already going to exactly that kind of training center.  To them, Sweden was just continuing their relationship, but appeared to be modernizing in accordance with the newly introduced fascist ideologies.

Sweden was already making bank selling Iron to Germany, so Germany assumed (quite naturally) that Sweden would want to continue the relationship, and at worse was also extorting more money from Norway, which was totally cool by the SS."
"And Germany was dependent of the Swedish iron production. Then again, it's not like Sweden could've declined selling the iron considering that in that case the Germans would've taken it by force."
Important to note is that they were only alowed on the trains when norway was already finished.
"My wifes grandfather worked as a railway-station master outside Hässleholm during the war.

He knew when the trains with German soldier would pass on their way to Norway. So he raised the Union Jack from the flagpole on the station every single time."
"My friend's Danish mother kind of hates Sweden because of this :(

She loves IKEA though"
Very good point that I did not know!
"Good to see some fixed numbers instead of my memory! I believe there were other combatants from around scandinavia that served in the swedish regiment, though at a smaller number. We also accepted many war children from around Europe, including many Jews from Denmark. 

It's a mixed bag, of course but it's good to see some good was done."
"They may have been able to do something assuming the navy was in the right place at the right time, but I have my doubts. Sweden had only 13 destroyers at the beginning of the war compared to Germany's 21. Sweden also had a huge coastline to defend. But the real issue is all the german ships were made in the 30s, Sweden's fleet was older with a handful of ships that were remotely up to date. (Based on wikipedia lists of 1939 available ships).

All I can say with certainty is the fixed land defences in southern Sweden was abysmal. There are a lot of awesome historical museums in my area that talk about the war, the defence positions we had and how it was developed."
What?
Do you have a source for that claim?
"In most of Europe young men were dying in droves. There was famine, misery and people were gassed to death in concentration camps.

Meanwhile in Sweden..

"Who are ""they""? The Quisling-led collaborationist traitor government that had no popular support? 

The legitimate Norwegian government and the King were in London, aiding the allied war effort."
"They did it under the forced leadership of a guy who never got over 2% of votes before Norway was occupied, and whose name is a synonym for a traitor all around the world today. Besides a few people who supported the Nazis, Norway has nothing to be ashamed of."
"Because the nazis literally took over the country, but let's just gloss over that fact"
"These ""police troops"" never engaged in combat. We paid for a few thousand Norwegians to sit in the forest and run around for a year, then the war was over."
Months after the Winter War was over?
No they allowed transport  of relief troops to Norway.
"Ofc I know, but this is internet, you do not have to fight or prove something to others. For me personally soldiers from every country were heroes ;)"

Sweden gave limited concessions under duress after being isolated due to Axis *and* Allied actions. It also helped the Allied in multiple different ways, while trying to limit what they had to give Germany.   
  
If they did not want Sweden to give concessions to Germany... then maybe Soviet shouldn't have been invading Finland? Maybe Britain shouldn't have goaded Hitler into invading Denmark and Norway?  
  
> Sweden helped alles only after it became evident that they will win.  
  
Blatant misinformation."
It's amazing how Sweden gets more shit for being neutral than countries that actually allied Germany like Italy or Finland does.
"As a Swede, I actually agree with you. Our actions during WWII were quite shameful. Many of my compatriots are, unfortunately, in denial."
"Why? Everyone knows exactly what I mean anyways, and most people do it."
No.
"It's to make it easier. By saying we instead of they, it makes it easier to differentiate from the germans and the swedish without having to specify all the time."
Please stop trying to police other people's language. Thank you.
Sweden is a kingdom still and he is using the royal 'we' as is customs. /s
"Of course, but that is exactly when having principles really matters. Nobody is saying that Sweden could have withheld Germany, and it certainly would have been costly. But if sweden had taken a stand against the Nazis and forced Germany to commit even more forces to keeping occupations they would have made things significantly harder for Germany and the war might have ended sooner"
My comment is refering to the couple of thousands of Norweigeans who were trained in Sweden to act as a liberation force - under the guise of being a police force.
"Also during the war, Sweden became entierly dependant on germany for all fuel (coal and oil) and fertilizer. Refusing german trade would not only have been against the articles of neutrality, but led to severe food production and distribution problems."
"Occupation ties up the invading forces. 

Vichy France enabled more German troops to be on the frontlines."
"Sweden could have stood against the Germans before Norway fell (as the Swedish navy was large enough to deter any German invasions, which is partly why the Germans invaded Norway to begin with) But as soon as Norway and Denmark was gone the Swedish defences were so compromised that would not have been able to stop a German invasion, so at that point cooperation would have been necessary."
"Actually, as detailed in documents uncovered in Swedish and German archives, as detailed in the book ""Blodsporet"" (published in 2012), German material and ""medics"" were allowed to pass while active fighting was still going on in Northern Norway. So many alleged medics and other claimed medical personnel were allowed to transit the Swedish rail network that in the end there were 15 infantry soldiers for 1 medical personnel on the front lines, a ratio not seen elsewhere on the front.. The book details that most of the ""medical personnel"" were actually special forces and the sealed train cars mostly contained ammunition, firearms and light artillery pieces. This information is based on letters/telegrams and reports sent back to the German HQ as well as documents produced by Swedish intelligence and government."
"Its interesting to see pictures of swedish soldiers guarding the transit trains. They are faced inwards towards the (unarmed) germans, making a pretty strong statement regarding who they consider the threat.."

"Misread, it was the king who was turned away at the border.

Lots of Norwegians had a temporary stay in sweden and went back home after the initial invasion and occupation."

>One also gets 8 eggs per month."
">... and whose name is a synonym for a traitor all around the world today

For anyone wondering, the word is [quisling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling).

>He was found guilty of charges including embezzlement, murder and high treason against the Norwegian state, and was sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad at Akershus Fortress, Oslo, on 24 October 1945. The word ""quisling"" became a byword for ""collaborator"" or ""traitor"" in several languages, reflecting the contempt with which Quisling's conduct has been regarded, both at the time and since his death."
Where did I hear this before hmmm
"Aka the continuation war. 

Sweden was about to reject this german request for tranait, were it not fo Finnish pressure."
Calling nazi soldiers heroes? That's a hot take.
">Source? 

Wangel 1982. Deals with troop shipment through sweden and finland. Ignore the finland part, because that isn't relavent.

Or read Blodsporet. It's a primary source.

Trains full of soldiers were sent up to norway. Nazi soldiers.

>Sweden gave limited concessions under duress after being isolated due to Axis and Allied actions. It also helped the Allied in multiple different ways, while trying to limit what they had to give Germany. 

Limited consessions like allowing nazis to use the telegaph lines? ( Even though they were tapped, the sweds did not share that info with the British till after Stalingrad ). Like allowing nazis to march through their country and go murder norwegians?.

>If they did not want Sweden to give concessions to Germany... then maybe Soviet shouldn't have been invading Finland? Maybe Britain shouldn't have goaded Hitler into invading Denmark and Norway?

 That isn't an argument. Nothing excused helping the nazis.

>Blatant misinformation.

Sweden started helping the British in any substantial way after 1943, ie after the Libyan campain and after Stalingrad ."
"Finland wasn't allied with Germany, they were co-belligerent. They fought the Soviets who had imperial ambitions, and then they found the Nazis in 44 and 45 to expel the Nazis.

Did they make moral compromises? Yes. But at least they didn't just stand idly by hoping someone else would take the damage. Italy is rightly condemned for being part of the Axis and obviously was worse than Sweden in its actions.

Let's face it, if the Nazis had won Sweden would have been independent for about 5 minutes before being a part of the Reich to some degree. Waiting for other people to do the dying, killing, spending, etc. was selfishness of an absurd degree."
"Glad there are some sensible folks.

You can't be neutral in the face of an imperial war mongering nation on your doorstep. You're not neutral, you're just last in line."
"Right, but to a fascist the line between military and police is blurred, which is the point they were making."
"Yes, but it's hard to blame the Swedish government of the time for steering clear of an avoidable war that would almost certainly be lost, especially since the end result of the World War itself was of course unknown.

A lot of countries of the period would've picked the same position of neutrality if they had the choice."
Yes shame on Swedes for not being willing to subject themselves to tyranny and suppression by an foreign power in order to tie up an insignificant amount of invading soldiers.
About 10 % of the people in Norway were German troops.
"Not a chance. It wasn't untill 1943 that the Swedish army had caught up with the reality of how Europe had changed. The army was seriously underfunded, underequipped. The navy did stand out, but german air superiority would've been more or less assured there's no way it would've been able to deter an invasion."
"Lol. Absolutely not. There's even a saying in Sweden today; 'Vår [Seriges] beredskap är god' i.e. 'We (Sweden) is well prepared' which was a famous quote by our then PM P.A. Hanson, wich has become synonymos with someone being totaly NOT prepared.
Today someone might utter those words for an exam they didnt study for, or after your team just got destroyed in football... in jest."
You should look at a map.
... are you thinking of Finland?
"Soldiers are soldiers, and they did they job. I did not say a word about nazi.
Not all german, italian, japan soldiers were nazi, same as not all soviet soldiers were communists. You need to have a lot of guts to go through the hell they did. So yes, most of them are (we are not speaking about war crimes) heroes. Again, I'm speaking about simple soldiers, not their commanders ot nation leaders."
"20 European countries *did* try to keep neutral, and less then half managed to do so throughout the war."
"Most countriesike Norway, Denmark, Benelux, Czechoslawakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, etc. Choose neutrality.

Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal and Spain were just more lucky to not be invaded"
"At the peak, about 1 in every 10 person in Norway was a German soldier. Occupation ties up a large amount of manpower that could be used elsewhere. Occupying Sweden would've stretched German forces even thinner and probably made the eastern front even less likely to make progress."
"Being neutral wasn't the only thing Sweden did, it basically helped Germany invade Northern Norway."
"The army is not a important piece in defending a naval invasion. Also German air power in the naval terms was pretty weak throughout the whole war, but especially in the early part (the German for example had no working aerial torpedoes and not really naval bombs which could hurt a large warship either).



Maybe Sweden could not have withstood a German invasion, but at least at the time the Germans viewed a naval invasion of Sweden to be practically suicide (as even if the invasion would have succeeded the German naval forces would be only u-boats, the ships under construction and maybe a destroyer or two)."
"Yupp sums it up. The only nations that was by their own volition firm and 1. go to war against Germany and 2. stay independent in Europe would be the UK and Russia afaik. 


Makes one humble."
"it had nothing to do with luck, and all to do with being willing to cooperate and help Germany"
"While it is true that occupying Sweden would've demanded more troops, the heavy German presence in Norway wasn't there to keep the Norwegians in check, but to deter Allied landing threatening Swedish iron ore production."
Which apparently didn't matter because the Germans were utterly defeated either way.
"Nope, Sweden only allowed German troops to transit through the country after Norway had been defeated. Germany had asked for transit during the invasion, but it was **rejected**."
"Well yeah, resistance would mean an invasion.  Germany was going to Germany, you could either pretend to be chill or get your entire army taken prisoner and sent to labor camps, and the rest of your population thrust in to poverty.  Your choice.


The King of Norway was also given that choice, give up the crown or fight for it.  He picked fight.  He lost, miserably.  The only saving grace was what his choice did to bolster a resistance movement years later.

Sweden simply did not have the ability to fight a Germany invasion.  They had to capitulate."
"To be fair, German Intelligence during those days did not do that great of a job. Swedish historians are pretty much in agreement that we were not ready to fend off an invasion untill late 1942 - but at which point, Barbarossa had started and after that Germany had their hands full and would never have been able to free up the resources for it."
"Not letting the germans use the trains would not start an invasion of Sweden, that would need a really good source if you want to claim that.

I don't believe we lost miserably, we fought for two months, and lost. We were a country of 3 million, and I'm proud that we stood up against the nazis."

"Wait is that the night bus? Oh no, Harry’s dead"
"Imagine seeing that from the pub window. Him flying past, getting up then coming inside.

Hope he got a free beer or two."
Because his shoes didnt come off
How did that pole survived
"He’s full of adrenaline now, but in the next 30 or so minutes will be the worst pain in his entire life."
"A few years ago a friend of mine tried to commit suicide, he had gone to the doctor and found out he was dyslexic he was so upset about it he went outside and jumped behind a bus."
They guy in black in the back is the funniest shit. Wanting to go check up on him and then being like “wtf? Nothing happened?”
Then he just goes on about his business.
"I once saw a guy get hit by a bus, he got up and was conscious, but sadly he died of internal injuries a month later."
I was just going to check if the pub was open. Now I deserve a drink
"A bus hit me, ok, let’s have that beer"
"- hey lad, can I get another pint?

- you might wanna get all that blood streaming down your head checked first"
"This guy suffered 2 fractures to his shoulder and ribs, and also internal bruising. The bus driver has been given a suspended jail sentence and a 24 month driving ban.

The most surprising thing in this video
The way the guy on the other side of the road freezes in place...
"""20 B&H please mate."""
The most surprising thing in this video
"So how was your day, honey? Uh mm..."
Dude just walks into that building like nothing happened.
""" I am not wrong"
"Oh look, the Winchester."
Please tell me what cheat code to use
The guy across the street was limping more than the guy that got hit by the bus.
If that was a San Andreas NPC he would've dived in front of the bus to avoid the bus!
Tell me I’m not the only one.
Ass must be thicc
Gun street
That building being as tall as it was saved him. Top of the bus hits the building and pushes it back into the street. He wouldve been run over if he wasnt next to the buildings
"I mean, the bus driver still did their job. Took him to his destination quickly."
Why does this use the “nobody:” format?
So British to get up and just walk into the pub for a drink.
"As true is this is, whoever made this did the worst case of r/uselessnobody every seen. It doesn't even make sense. If it was

Nobody:

GTA NPC's:

Then it would actually make sense. If you're going to murder a meme with ""Nobody:"", at least do it properly."
Can’t stop a man on a quest for 2 for £5 jäger bombs
How did you manage to get some footage of the Knight bus in action?
"Wasn't his day to die.  Also, props for the way he got up and went into the cafe for a cup of coffee."
"This looks radically worse than it is (it's still very bad, don't get me wrong).

If you watch closely, you can see the bus jerk as if it just hit a speed bump, right before hitting him. This is the driver slamming on the breaks and that upward movement is a sign of just how much momentum the bus is shedding nearly instantly.

Now watch the pedestrian and how far he is flung. It's about 6-10 feet. This indicates how little momentum was imparted to him. It's certainly enough to do damage, break bones, etc. He may be far more injured than that short few steps at the end indicates, but it's not the kind of impact that simply pulverizes someone and kills them instantly. Had it been, he would have been thrown far off screen."
My home town and regular bar
He got up and most likely was in complete shock. I guarantee once that adrenaline ran out. That dude collapsed.
"The person watching the guy get hit starts rushes over to help.  The guy walks into the bar...
Onlooker freezes"
He got a good back crack and went on to his missus that day
The bus was clearly just moving him out of the way from the debris.
"The guy on the other side of the street is thinking he just saw someone get killed. Starts walking towards the man, sees him get up and walk into the bar, and just stops. I can only imagine he's got a huge WTF expression."
Humans are weird they sometimes die from a small pin and not die in extreme cases like this one
AND IF A DOUBLE DECKER BUS...
That's a hell of a lick they took
If this was in the reserves?
So casual it must be his daily routine.

They guy in the background looks to have gotten the injury instead.
"Learn to drive, asshole!"
its the vest
Gets hit by a bus and walks right into the pub.
When you need a pack of smokes you need a pack of smokes
Lizard people
"So, is this guy lucky or unlucky?"
I've never felt the urge to buy vest till now
"Gun street doesn't kill people, busses on Gun street..... apparently also don't kill people."
That pedestrian probably expected him not to stand up after that. Damn!
He's got places to be
He’s going to FEEL that bus for weeks at BEST.
He needs a drink
Adrenaline is a hell of a drug
"I've heard of stories in passing of crazy shit happening with shock where people just get completely obliterated by something but they'll attempt to get up and walk for a few seconds before keeling over dead. I'm thinking specifically of guys that get blown nearly in half by artillery shells but are briefly able to react. 

I think there were some examples on r/WatchPeopleDie back when it was a thing."
Just walk it off.
r/bitchimabus
holy shit what a comment hahaha
"TBH, the bus didn't completely miss him."
"It's weird how many people actually know this place. 
Is it famous in England."
"That’s kind of amazing those are the only injuries he had. If you watch it in slowmo, you can see he slightly arches his back towards the glass and it makes it so his feet didn’t get caught under bus and also propelled him forward more which probably saved his life"
"Jesus I though it looked familiar! It's been so long since I've been in there.
Is pavlov's dog still round the corner?"
Was it a bar? My goodness! Ha ha! This could only be more British if Queen Liz was driving a mini metro with Blur’s Parklife on the stereo.
"I love the thought of him just being like “welp, time to drink”."
Hello from Reading too!
"Hes an old school guy and is pretty tough apparently, my mate knows him, think he said he used to be a drug dealer back in the day."
Hopefully he got medical help. No way with an impact like that he didnt get a serious concussion.
"""You won't believe the day I've had!"""
I like the name of the bar. Does it have purple turtle decor inside?
"From an article, fractured shoulder and internal bruising"
20 minutes later......
"Also he hit a windshield. The windshield will break and bend. This greatly increases the time of the impact greatly decreasing the forces, and the bending increases the area of the body that absorbs the force.

Finally, the bus wasn't going that fast. I didn't count frames, but I doubt the bus was going more than 25mph at the time of impact. Slower speed means less momentum. Less momentum means less force transferred to the pedestrian."
His head literally smashed the glass on the bus.
Maybe there were spirits at play (except for the ones in the bar)
"True, wtf is this doing in this sub? This sub is flooded with wrong content..."
"Why would tensing up make things worse? I'm genuinely curious, because i feel like I'd do it too."
He still likey would have preferred not to be hit.
r/videogameshit
The nobody ruined a perfectly fine meme.
He came across to check on him and then didn’t bother once he realised he’d entered the pub
"The guy who is walking normal before the accident and then after he’s limping after? I was like “Damn, the bus hit that guy so hard. The other guy across the street is walking with a limp”."

"Jokes in you, my man had hella back problems and that his just straightened him Tf out. Hasn't felt that good in 20 years."
"I remember this video, the guy got away with small injuries."
“I need to sit down”.
That is a pub he walks into I remember the story
He needs some milk.
"> I've heard of stories in passing of crazy shit happening with shock where people just get completely obliterated by something but they'll attempt to get up and walk for a few seconds before keeling over dead.

10-15 years ago a local 18 year old Eagle Scout was in a gnarly wreck hitting a deer out of no where on a curved gravel road and flipping his car in the ditch. He some how walked a mile to the nearest house explained what happened, told them to call 911, and told the owners how to treat shock because he was going to go into it before he went unconscious. He ended up surviving."
"Not particularly famous in regards to England, but everyone in and around Reading knows Purple Turtle. it's closed for lockdown and I miss it dearly"
"Well, you can see ""Reading"" on the side of the bus for a few frames"
I have also drank in this pub many times many years ago. It's a quirky bar that's been there for a long time.
"It's the best night out in Reading. Never really considered it famous, but I suppose if you were once a student and visited then you might know it."
I think you underestimate how even none drinkers know the name of every pub and club within a 20 mile radius of them. I guess it’s like an English super power.
"It's a pub in Reading which has a huge university so there's tons of student population there. Also, its a commuter town to London for work and its like a stop-over for people travelling to Wales from London and back."
"Yeah it’s called the Purple Turtle, hugely popular bar in Reading. 

Also amusingly r/reading is for the town and the amount of people posting about books is great"
"It was purple turtle, a rock bar. Everyone from the area now watches their back when crossing the road to go in"
"""Just got hit by a bus, make it a double."""
"What do you mean apparently? He got hit by a bus and went about his day, I think that pushes him over the pretty tough threshold"
That’s not bad considering he got hit by a bus going 40mph
"""tell you what, my shoulder and back are pretty sore. weird.

anyway, another fosters please mate."""
"Good points, but would it be 'less force' or 'less energy'? 

The impulse (delta p) results in a change in v, so I was assuming a change in KE was the proper way to state it, per the theorey  (Trying to recall my bullet hitting a block on a string homework from 12 years ago)."
"Think of dried spaghetti, really easy to snap. But if you cook it then it's pliable and it's not so easy to snap anymore."
"Seems like 9 times out of 10, you could crop the ""nobody"" out of a meme and the meme would be better. It very rarely adds any meaning or humour"
"Not at all, potentially"
He fell face-forward. There’s a 71% probability that he broke his genitals
That would honestly be the best thing I've ever heard. Then I imagine people would start jumping out Infront of busses
"Happened to my grandpa several years back. Had back problems, doctor told him he'd be in a walker in 2 years and a wheelchair in 5, then he got in a car wreck. Felt a pop in his lower back and hasn't had problems since."
"Weird. There's a Purple Turtle near where I grew up that's basically a shake shack knock off, it's one of the more well-known landmarks in town. Never knew there was original that was a bar"
What’s that got to do with the pub?
"Damn right it is, how else would we put up with living on these islands?"
"Let’s be real, almost all directions I’ve ever been given consist of “do you know where the fox and hounds (or any pub) is? Take a right from there etc etc..”

It’s just how we do travelling"
haha that’s great
No one i know does!
Clearly something very wrong with him if he's suddenly ordering Fosters.
"Indeed, that guy could be superman for all we know"
"Aha that's a reasonable assumption to be fair, it's the 17 bus, goes from Tilehurst to The Wokingham Road"
"The pub is in Reading, England, pronounced red-ing"
One of the only bars in Reading thats been there for a long time under the same name with the same purple and green front.
Hahaha that’s made my day.
my time as a barman has taught me not to judge (too harshly) peoples heinous choice in cheap beer
Yeah I knew that. I feel like we’re all on different pages.
Ah I see now
I feel like you are just desensitized to the horror.
I’m judging you **extremely harshly** right now.

Which is why it's hilarious when braindead conservatives call someone like Biden a radical leftist. Any time you see someone saying 'Radical left wing liberal' or 'socialist liberal' or anything to that effect you know that you can disregard any opinion they have about politics without a second thought. The difference between a leftist and a liberal is waaaaay bigger than a liberal and a conservative.
Comment
"It can be funny where your career takes you sometimes. If someone had said ten years ago that I would one day be writing for The Times I would have laughed, and yet here I am on Monday evening opening this with a question that has been playing on my mind all day: have I done enough?

I barely slept on Sunday night, nervous and worried about the delivery of my open letter, not because of the stance I was taking — that was never in doubt — but because I knew the impact a U-turn decision could have on families just like mine: low-income families who rarely have a voice.

People often ask me how it felt to score the deciding penalty against PSG to knock them out of the Champions League last season, my answer is always the same: did we go on to win the tournament? I have been overwhelmed by the support I’ve received over the last 24 hours, from MPs and members of the public, but the feeling I have is exactly the same as when we got knocked out of the Champions League against Barcelona in the next round: what did we achieve if we didn’t get the result we needed? If we didn’t lift the Champions League trophy?

Today I focus on a trophy that stands for something much bigger than football. A U-turn on the decision to stop the free food voucher scheme continuing over the summer holidays could help us reach the next round but we still have a very long way to go as a country to eventually lift the trophy. In this case, the trophy is combating child poverty.

I don’t claim to have the education of an MP in parliament, but I do have a social education. I am clued up on the difference a U-turn decision would make on the 1.3 million vulnerable children across the UK who are registered for free school meals because ten years ago I was one of them.

I know what it feels like to be hungry. I’m well aware that at times my friends only invited me to eat at their houses for their parents’ reassurance that I was eating that evening. That was my community, the community that made the Marcus Rashford you see before you today asking for your help: an England international footballer. As I passed through Manchester city centre on the bus as a child and witnessed homelessness on every street corner, I swore that if one day I got in a position to help those people most in need then that is what I would do.

I recognise that I have a valuable platform that allows my voice to be heard and I’m asking you to listen to the stories of these vulnerable families. People are hurting and we continue to ignore their cries for help. Of the 1.3 million children registered for free school meals, a quarter of them have not received any help to date during the lockdown — a forgotten generation.

When you next wake up and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown. When you turn on the kettle to make a cup of tea or coffee, think of those parents who have had to default on electricity bill payments just to make ends meet, having lost their jobs during the pandemic.

And when you head to the fridge to grab the milk, stop and recognise that parents of at least 200,000 children across the country are waking up to empty shelves and the innocent question “why?”. Today nine out of thirty children in any given classroom are asking why. Why does their future not matter?

This is the devastating reality of child poverty in England in 2020. This is a pandemic that will last generations if we don’t change our thinking now.

We should consider that these pandemics we are living through, Covid-19 and child poverty, will have huge effects on the long-term mental stability of both parents and children, and their reintegration into society. A society which, in their eyes, is failing them.

My mum would go days without sleeping, worrying about how she would cover the next round of bills, worried that I could get in trouble, mixing with the wrong crowds, if she couldn’t keep her eyes on me while working every hour of the day. Even at seven or eight years old I recognised her worry, but I also recognised that she was trying her best. I’ve said it once and I will say it again: this system was not built for families like mine to succeed, no matter how hard we are working.

I’ve heard the term “ordinarily” used often over the past 24 hours. I think we can all agree that these are far from ordinary times, so our approach should be anything but ordinary to protect our vulnerable children.

When it comes to pulling the national team shirt on we put any rivalry aside — we are England and we stand united. Today I am asking that all MPs put their rivalries aside and stand in solidarity on an issue that could prove detrimental to the stability of families across the country for generations to come. Help us break the cycle of hardship.

Please, do the right thing and extend the free food voucher scheme throughout the school summer holidays. Give our vulnerable families just one less thing to worry about"
"Great work from Rashford, it's been great to read about his work in the community and see him continue to press for this worthwhile cause. Some of the facts and figures that he quotes are heartbreaking.

If he stays at Man U then he will have ended world hunger by 2030
This is one trophy I will happily cheer Marcus lifting.
"Comrade Rashford, come to Sankt Pauli

(Really glad to see a person of his means and profile do at least some good of the like, with it. Now, let's get across that poverty is not an individual failing but a systemic feature - and maybe have footballers show more solidarity with their fellow workers, no matter how much less paid - and we'll be golden.)"
"Maximum respect to Marcus Rashford for this. 

England’s finest."
This man has my utmost respect. No other footballer comes close
So fucking proud of my boy.
"a decent person in thoroughly indecent times, governed by the worst kind of politician."
Nothing but class from Rashford
"Fucking hell Marcus, I'm trying to hate you, or at the very least dislike you, but you're making this extremely hard.

I don't know what's going on but...I think I want this guy, a Man Utd player, to play well and have a great career? Damn it, look at what you've done Marcus."
"[258 Million kids around the world will never step foot in a classroom and with that 1-in-5 primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa don't attend school. It's well known that many children can't attend school, but we haven't done as much in the last few years that shifted our worldwide education. Helping anyone, anywhere will make a difference in the world's interest. So what can we do to help? Sign a petition, learn more about this education problem, educate others whether online or not. Create a better world with what we have.]"
My god. What an absolute gem of a guy.
I hope he gets a minutes applause at every stadium once the fans are allowed back in
"Fucking love Marcus Rashford, massive credit to him the things he's doing especially so early in his career. Can easily see how serious he is about actual change."
Proper bloke and a top top lad at this age.
United fans must be so happy to have this kid at their club. A quality player and a quality person.
"He's a top top man. Putting our politicians to shame who use footballers for cheap shots and a us Vs them war.

Rashford has shown a level of maturity I wish our parliament showed as well."

What a lad
"We need more role-models like him now more than ever. In these times, the maturity and generosity he has shown at just the age of 22 is really commendable. That speaks more about him and where does he come from & what values he has been brought up with. It's is easy to be surrounded by chaos but the hope of continuing and doing something good everyday for betterment of people is the part of the dream.
Danke, Marcus."
"Sheer class, you just cant dislike the guy"
Our Government are cocks but Rashford is class for this.
"I hope the Glazers are at least matching his donations, otherwise people might start to get the idea that they're greedy parasites."
What a brave guy
"Marcus Rashford is most of us who want to help people but can't, but he can and is he doing something about it. What a lad"
"Just got the news update they’ve been extended over the summer break. Excellent campaigning and work, what a person"
"Breaking news just now.....the government has u turned thankfully......disadvantaged children will get 6 weeks of free meals.
Well done Marcus.

Who hates Rashford I'm not even a fan
"Same kid who learned sign language so he could judge a competition for deaf kids.

Some people are just great. I think he's one of those who will do very well after sport as he has his priorities in check. Beautiful thing to do."
"I grew up in poverty just like Rashford and this text struck home. As a future doctor, I hope to have the same impact in my  working-class community as Rashford has on his and England's. He's someone we should all look up to and strive to emulate, despite being younger than many of us.

No child should go to bed hungry or worry about having something to eat before going to class, especially in the West, where there's abundance of everything."
"Nothing but respect for Rashford. Please please please can all of you who read this article remember the disgraceful way the conservative government have acted over the years, and vote these cunts out next time there's a general election. Fuck the Tories."

"Love to see someone stand by their roots, remember their struggle, and instead of turning their back on those in the same situation he lifts them up.

The past 10 years of austerity have crippled the working class and it's tragic that a 22 year old footballer has to be a champion against it. Very proud and impressed, but heartbroken that he has to do this."
even the Audi cup?
I am so fucking proud of him
Guess they really do give out trophies for everything now
It's the future of Manchester united to be sold to no one.
"Im calling it now, Sir Marcus Rashford by the 22/23 season."
Nah mate the Europa League is let's get UCL qualification in the big
Doubt anyone is doing it on the pitch.
You lost to a PL club and not Brentford
"How to use your platform for good 101. I love everything Marcus Rashford is doing right now.

So proud of this man. Makes me proud to be human"
i dont know the man but respect him greatly
">I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: this system was not built for families like mine to succeed.

Scathing, and he’s totally right. The system is built from the ground up to ensure the working class stay exactly where they are. For every working class person that’s went on to succeed thanks to their efforts, there’s a thousand who haven’t despite that very same effort. 

This country is completely and utterly fucked. You have no idea how glad it makes me to see people waking up to this and openly discussing the fact that things like this aren’t bad luck or an unfortunate event, life is a game to them and they’ve ensured it’s rigged from the very beginning."
What an incredible young man he is
"I really hope that all of his hard work leads to something positive. He seems like a great person fighting for something that we shouldn’t have to fight for. 

Now if only he didn’t play for Manchester United..."
Probably the one United player that will not be booed at Anfield from now on. Now that will be an absolute rarity.
agreed
"From the first moment this guy stepped on the field, I could not dislike him. Glad that he hasn't disappointed."
"I mean, they should start following a different sport. Because football is not their forte."
If I was a UK bloke I'd vote for this guy if he ever took a role for the labour party not sure if that party is still the best yall have.
RASHFORD FOR PM
I won’t get a trophy?
Yeah because he was a bigger Demon
Well done Marcus
Big ups to Rashford. Don't let the government distract you from the fact they tried to completely squash this though. Rashford is a saint for pressing on and helping to get it done.
I disagree. But hey good for you man!
"Top lad honestly, hats off"
"How do you “end poverty?” Every time the standard of living is raised some will necessarily fall to the lowest levels of attainment. Nowadays everyone is “not poor,” when compared to the Middle Ages. More virtue signaling this time from a footballer"
"right, instead of keeping your tens of millions of dollars salary to kick a ball around, many of these athletes should be doing more... i wish i could do more but with rent being more than 50% of my income , i can only give a few dollars here or there"
An absolute legend. Fair play to him.
Good to see him show up just how scummy Tories really are
is this man trying to get a knighthood? cos that's how you get a knighthood.
"Absolutely incredible from Marcus Rashford and I really hope he is successful!! 

It's a shame the people he is reaching out to are the likes of [this](https://twitter.com/theresecoffey/status/1272789819354161152) idiot but I remain hopeful"
"Everyone likes Marcus Rashford...22 years old and already a better person than most. Almost world class footballer too, Ronaldo's heir"
I mean... fucking obviously though right? Don’t think anyone in the world would disagree with this. Sort of a dumb sentence.
"good for him because he won't win any if he stays at United. 

Jokes a side I hope he can accomplish everything he wants, such a great person."
Seems like a top bloke. Hope he gets a move to a proper football club soon
"Ok guys, hear me out. I have all the respect for Rashford. Great guy, doing fabulous stuff. But these threads are getting a little bit... too frequent. I mean there is this thread, before that the Boris Johnson one, before that when he wrote the letter..... and so on (all of them on top of hot). And nearly all the comments are the same. 

Now this is not a bad thing per se but It would be better if we had a football realted thread on top, instead of a Rashford thread on top every other day."
Hope he goes into politics after football and really effect impactful  changes to uplift society as a whole.
"Hes got no chance of a trophy anyway, but good on him. He might be a dirty manc on the pitch but at least hes a human being off the pitch"
"What is ""child poverty""?"
No shit.
"_Child_ poverty. But there are child labor laws – even though businesses aren’t supposed to discriminate based on age.

Wish I could have made bank at age 7. Shit."
Child poverty is parents with a lack of children? Or children that don't make above minimum wage? A little confused.
tldr; gib more moneh to inefficient government programs
Tbf ending child poverty in uk is looking more likely than man united winning a trophy in the foreseable future.
"Cynical me - Had it been a white footballer, maybe there would have been a photo op organized by Tories between the footballer and Boris, for positive optics of the Tories, before Boris rejected the footballers plea!"

Thats good and all but you aint't gonna have much thropies while being in man u /s
hes doing ok with what he was given I think
"That's nice cuz I doubt he'll ever win any trophy in football.



Jokes aside, the article is felt well written and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing. Great lad"
Free handouts and government dependence do not and will not end child poverty.

He finally realized he won't be getting any with Utd
Ending poverty for everyone might be even better
You can do pretty much anything in the world and it will be more important than soccer.

"I'm glad he said that, because until now I thought football trophies were _much_ better than ending world hunger. I mean, who wouldn't? What a div."

"Fucking hell what a brilliant read. Fact that he’s 22 year old one year more than me really was a kick in the guts. Our role with more money should be to help those under privileged, those not as fortunate with the luck we have. Birth and the circumstances we are in is something that we can’t decide."
"There’s so much to like here. ”This system was not built for families like mine to succeed, no matter how hard we are working”, such a powerful statement coming from a sport culture where the myth of if you want something enough and work hard enough anything is possible still lives so strong. What a great human being."
"I was one of those children, I remember a benefit change taking place sometime around the age of 9 where my mum was left with 4 children to feed with absolutely NO income for 10 days.

I remember eating actual UNCOOKED spaghetti because I was sick with hunger but the gas had ran out, I remember waking up in the dead of winter for school with absolutely NO lights or heat because the meter had used the last of the emergency during the night...

My free school meal allowance in high school was £1.50 per day (iirc) a sandwich was around £1.75... I stole food from the cafeteria almost daily, it was just the done thing between me and my friends, that or have chips and gravy for dinner... Again.

It got to the point we were outright banned from entering, we had to bring food from home if we wanted to eat (we weren't allowed off site) guess who didn't have food to bring from home.... 

And what have we improved in the last 20 years? Absolutely fucking nothing. 

Those same struggles then are still the same struggles today, want to know why people like me cannot stand authority? Why we couldn't care less about the ""prosperity"" of the country? We don't take part in it, we never have and we don't feel like we ever will.

Naturally Manchester is considered a ""rival"" with Leeds, but the truth of the matter is we are actually allies, we all are, black, white, yellow, green, whatever colour or creed, we all had those same struggles.

The working man in Mexico has far more in common with the working man in the UK than either of them do with their politicians.

We need to use our voices and speak up against these kind of social injustices because these children HAVE NO VOICE, nobody is speaking up for them, and therefore they become forgotten, just an endless cycle of crime and poverty.

I applaud Rashford immensely, an actual genuine young lad who has not forgotten the people who made him into the success he is today, he has a huge platform to speak up and be heard and he is using it, we need to get behind him and support him.

Even ONE child going to bed hungry is a tragedy, no country should be proud of knowing that their children cannot eat whilst we throw away enough food to feed them all every single day. 

Child hunger should not ever be a thing, we have to end it, now."
This guy really sounds like a modern jesus.
A 22 year old footballer doing more for the community then Boris Johnson has ever done for England.
"This fucking touched me cause i was that kid as well. Shouts out to Rashford, a fucking king among peasants. I sincerely hopes he succeeds with this"
He really poured his heart out in this. Fucking disgraceful what’s going on over the pond.
"> Why does their future not matter?

For me this is the most powerful sentence in the entire thing. What a guy Rashford is."
This guy has got a good head on his shoulders. I wish I could say I was this intelligent and eloquent at 22.
"Wow that was weird, as soon as I finished reading this I got a notification from BBC telling me they have done the Uturn. Well played Rashford.... also is this all just a simulation?"
"Sane dropped. Let's sign Rashford.

I know he won't leave MU but still."
This is a great piece by a great man.
">I don’t claim to have the education of an MP in parliament

Think he's overestimating the mental capacity of a lot of our MP's, and selling himself short! They're just good at kissing arse, and getting people to vote for them. 

Education doesn't come into it."
Respect brother! This must be a dream come true.
Give him the Ballon D'Or.
When thinking about Rashford and other footy players I began to wonder about maybe a group of people pushing to do this instead of our let down tory government. show them that people can do more.
"Completely offtopic but related to what he said about PSG comeback win. I am not Barcelona player but even I felt the same about PSG win, yeah it was good comeback but we got out in the next stage. I think most Barcelona players feel the same. But ofcourse the club will try to milk it considering the negativity in recent years same for united. I don't celebrate like Barcelona Twitter account or twitter fans do. I would take 2-0 win at Bernabeu in 2011 over this kind of win as that won us something and part of journey."
"I'm proud of this man as a human being, bravo"
"What a top lad, Marcus you are a hero"
Well done you did it! The UK government have done a U turn and will now provide the vouchers during the holidays.
Flowed like butter. Some douche nozzles go into politics after a career in x or y in this case football. Unlike the fakers this is a voice to be in the labour party some day.
"> I’ve said it once and I will say it again: this system was not built for families like mine to succeed, no matter how hard we are working.

This is clear - it was built around a family unit consisting of two parents. Raising children as a single parent was never expected to become the norm. Endemic fatherlessness in working class communities causes massive problems."
"It's okay.

Just go and watch some Alan Smith highlights and remember the hate"
"It's okay, we can just double our hate for someone else to make up for it, maybe Pogba?

Jokes aside Rashford is a top lad."
"Their decency and generousity just makes me hate them more! Some things are bigger than football, well done Marcus."

"Potentially just a bit of hyperbole, but what would the UK government do if he recruited Raheem, Trent, Hendo, Kane, etc and they vowed to refuse to ever play for England again until this was done? Do you think that would have any effect at all? Would it get people riled up enough to call for action, or would they just say to recruit scabs who would play?"
PM of a future Independent republic of England?
"Imagine the papers! Between their usual black footballer fear-mongering headlines, and their ""magic money trees""/""pie in the sky"" drivel, they'd have go back to two printed editions a day to fit everything in..."
I want this to happen just to see Lingard as Foreign Secretary. Milly Rock diplomacy is coming.
*Sir* Marcus Rashford
It’s great to know a player of his age thinks this way and has this mentality. We need more players like him in the sport

Shows it all really can’t argue the main point and instead picks up on the tiniest of things
">The ban on cutting the domestic water supply over non-payment was introduced in 1999 on public health grounds. 

So that was Labours doing.. 

Also, Rashford was alive back then. Admittedly, he probably can't remember it. But maybe his mum told him stories about having her water cut off. 

Anyway, she's missing the fucking point. Allowing people to have water, no matter what, when it's absolutely essential to live, is not anything to fucking boast about. It's the absolute bare fucking minimum a government should be guaranteeing."
"Ah yes, Therese ""#ProtectEachOtherSaveLives"" Coffey, pinnacle of being a great person she is."
But shes right.  Rashford was talking about kids going without a water due to poverty but your water doesnt get disconnected in the UK for non payment.
Hope you guys stay up. And I really wish that mote clubs could follow Sankt Pauli’s example of good community involvement. But we’re keeping Marcus.
Happy cake day
His teammate Mata is quite charitable.
Plenty of footballers do work to help people less fortunate than themselves.
"I respect your choice.

A lot of footballers do great things for their home communities.

Sadie Mane may be the humblest of them all."
Tyrone Mings has been doing a ton of good stuff too
Kante Mata and Rashford have all my respect in the world
well i saw a PSG flair after a long time today......
Just think about him playing for England
That's crazy we take education for granted so much.
"Absolutely, it brings us great pride. However like he said, we gotta win the final. No child deserves to go hungry anywhere in the world."
"It's great when the government attacks them for not doing enough then when they do, they do more than the government is actually doing"
I don't know this Rashfird bloke. May I suggest Rashford instead?
Governments are reflection of societies we live in. Rather than focusing towards changing government work towards improving society.
As opposed to labour being saints?
"So something like child poverty should be Rashford's 15 minutes of fame, and not a topic that affects millions of people? The comments are ""the same"" because a lot of us know someone who has, or have been personally affected by, this problem. It would all end, of course, if the Government were to agree with Rashford and continue the voucher scheme throughout the summer holidays"
"This is football related, he’s a footballer."
"It's one thread out of twenty on the front page. There was a time when a tweet of Klopp talking about the dumbest things would be on the front page, this is at least an important campaign."
"Well the thing is it isn't just the same thing over and over again, people are posting developments in his campaign so I guess that's alright."
A football player who makes heartfelt but obvious tweets is qualified to be a politician. Just another r/soccer hot-take.
Yeah and you're just a gobby cunt wherever you are
"When children live in poverty, theres a stonking big clue in the name."
"Not sure if you're joking, but it's children whose family are living below the poverty line"
"Its not inefficient tho? And speaking as someone who was on free school meals myself, they are literally a life line for some kids."
"What's your proposal, then - let the market sort it out?"
"I genuinely don't think it's cause he's black, its because he is trying to 'force the governments hand' for lack of a better term. He is basically asking them to change policy which the Tories probably think makes them look more inept and weak."
What’s your problem?
You're an embarrassment
Obviously not that wet if the relevant powers disagree and work towards preventing this goal
What
"Pretty sure hes already won some like the fa cup, league cup and Europa league"
Why do poor people have to be poor? Why can't they just be rich? Focus on fixing a system that lets these poor people starve instead of introducing a new system to further control the poor.
"And what about people that have fallen into poverty since having kids? Due to the huge amounts of job losses relating to this pandemic?

&#x200B;

Why do people not capable of a seconds thought post comments? Maybe that's the issue. Don't hit submit until you have given the crap you're saying a seconds thought. There should be some sort of licencing system where you have to apply before you're allowed to submit.

&#x200B;

Fucktard."
"He does cover this in his letter if you would re-read it.

&#x200B;

Let's not make THIS the argument.

Let's just all agree that however stupid you think their parents are - maybe the child would be better off fed?

Let's not blame the children for the mistakes of their parents right?

&#x200B;

No child should go hungry ever."
"And how do you plan on enforcing these conception rules without a police state? 
You know you're not saying anything new or edgy when you go on this ""People shouldn't do this"" spiel right? Obviously you shouldn't fucking have kids if you can't afford them. But people DO anyway, however much you moralise at them, like they have for millenia, and we can either have functioning social services and a safety net to give them a chance, or we can write them off and then spend that money anyway and act all outraged when our prisons are overflowing in about 20 years"

"I agree to an extent although it’s a very complicated issue. 

To be honest I think it’s incredibly selfish to have a ton of children knowing full well that they’ll be born into poverty, just because you *want* to be a parent."
"Ok I'll bite and answer your question. 

  1. Evolutionary urge to procreate.
  2. Some people love kids.
  3. Kids can be your way to escape poverty. Like the fine gentleman we are discussing about in this thread.

Also, unless you are from an aristocratic family, if you go back enough in your family tree, you'll find that your ancestors were poor too. Should they have not had kids?"
What a stupid comment that is. Really. I don't support United but I have lots and lots of respect for Rashford for doing what he does. Other players should take a note and do their part as well.
You sound like a great guy.
"You know he isn’t a SJW but is actively taking action right? If he’s just virtue signalling that’s a different debate but he’s literally partnered with a charity to get meals delivered to 3 million vulnerable people, raising $20 million pounds in the process. You prefer if these families go hungry?"
You know if he was being facetious or just raising hue and cry without doing anything I might have agreed with you. But the amount Rashford has done recently is so much that even 50% of it would be highly impressive.
He realized that his job on earth is bigger than kicking a ball
He's already won three trophies but whatever floats your boat
Trying to highlight a point you ponce
There’s definitely a good deal of people out there that don’t give a shit about families starving as long as they’re continuing to be successful and win trophies in life. It’s a great way to stay on top of the social hierarchy when you can eliminate a whole class of people from being able to ascend.
"Ah yes. Apart from the FA Cup, Europa League, League Cup that he's already won in his young career. He'll win a lot more. Of that I have little doubt."
Actually the fact he does play football is the reason he can
Wait what?
Surely you can understand that a job that makes him millions a year will help him more with his cause than 99% of other jobs.
You know Angelina Jolie was going to quit acting to go do charity work etc. She was convinced not to and carry on as she would do more for those charities through earnings and have a bigger stage to promote them.

I want Arsenal to sign him now
Took the words right out of my mouth with that opening sentence. One hell of a read.
"Yeah, and people like Rashford are used as examples by those who peddle the myth that all you need it to ""just work hard and you'll get what you deserve."" Tiptoeing around the fact that Rashford is a one-in-a-million case, and the reality is most people in poverty work harder than those not in it to simply make ends meet. This myth needs to end."
"I would really like it if you out this in a letter and addressed it to BJ. Better yet tweet it at him and tag Rashford. You highlight so well why vast swathes of the country do not feel part of it, and given that national pride is such a conservative shouting point, something they're so passionate about, it should make it all the more fitting"
"I know right. Whenever he played against us (Arsenal) I always thought he looked a bit arrogant for some reason. I couldn't be more wrong. Same goes with Pogba. When a player looks confident and a bit arrogant on the field we assume he must be a dick irl, but Pogba and Rash are some of the nicest people I've seen"
"No, he plays for City not United.

Seriously though, good on Rashford. The world needs more people like him."
And the government had the fucking gall to try and paint these footballers as not doing their 'part for the county' in the early stages of the pandemic.
This touched me because I was not that kid. Just made me realize how lucky I was.
"I mean I’d say both sides of the pond are having quite a time. But yeah, this balanced being passionate and articulate perfectly, wonderful statement about a shit situation"
Odd choice to make it about one country when this is more or less a global phenomenon.
Wait really?!
Marcus *Rad*ford
Happy to see that he hasn't apologised.
"The system not adapting to the reality of many 1 parent families is the issue. This is the reality, whether we like it or not. The children can’t help it, but they’re the victims. The parents more often than not don’t want it. It’s people who’ve never learned how to be a parent becoming parents, often far too young. Endemic fatherlessness is often not a choice. It’s better for a kid to grow up with one parent than two who can’t stand each other and fight all the time."
"That’s not the point he is making, at all."
"What a load of reactionary horseshit. Trying to blame his mum for being a single parent is some Victorian level thinking. Single parents have been around forever and will always be there, and should be supported.

The fact that there is such minimal support in place for parents who can't feed their families but there is for airlines and arms companies is a damning indictment of society and it has nothing to do with 'fatherlessness in working class communities'."
We lost our best shithouses in Herrera and Fellaini and gained Saint Juan and Marcus. We may not be top of the league but we are going to hold hands with the Pope and sing thank you Ghandi.
"Juan Mata is the only United player I really like, even though he left us a few seasons back (still miss him at times, I don't think we've replaced his corner taking ability yet). And now I guess Marcus rashford might join that list... Feels so weird"
"And we've got Ighalo, the man who's made the move he always wanted and he's just straight up loving life."
"No one actually hates Smith though, he sacrificed himself to save Leeds."

Happy cake day.
Depends which party he ended up in.

"By week 2 we'd have a third arm, an extra bollock, and smell that works around corners."
Kante deserves a place for being a nice bloke
There was a good response that some landlords will turn off utilities if tenants don't pay rent. He generalised a lot but it does happen.
It costs money to heat the water though.
"That was the only response she made to Rashford's letter for over an hour, and it was a subtweet about a minor point to avoid discussing the meat of the argument."
"Ah yes - we can't let Rashford off on a technicality, can we? Let's negate the whole of his argument because there was a mistake ROLF!!!1!!!. You fool."
"You’re an idiot he didn’t mean literally he meant they can’t afford to turn it on. Please don’t defend MP’s even if they’re technically right on minuscule irrelevant facts because this issue is so important.

Just back him and get the kids their fucking meals."
"Labour policy introduced in 1999, though. Lol."
"1. It was made illegal in 1999. It could well have happened to his mother 

2. Landlords can and do turn of water. It is illegal now but it is still done

3. When a person makes an impassioned plea for the government to ensure the children of this nation are able to eat food, the response from the secretary of state for work and pensions should not be a pedantic and ultimately *erroneous* point making.

 Its actually incredible that an educated person would think such a response to such an issue would be a good idea.

tl:dr

1.She was wrong

2. You're wrong

3. She was wrong and stupid"
Ffs man
"Yeah, Juan seems like a genuine and charming person"
Ozil is pretty amazing too.
It's not a contest.
Not many go this far though. This is well beyond the charity work of most footballers.
"I am happy a player is using their platform and wealth in a positive way. Though I  wonder if someone more disliked for their football, like Lingard, would be getting the same amount of praise."
"Definitely, I think it’s just remarkable that a 22 year old has helped raise close to £20m to help feed children. He’s gone above and beyond, this should be the government’s job but as usual they’re cocking things up"

"It's nice to see the moron slapped down but you've done it in a such a way where you implicitly agree with his point.

The fact is that people in poverty have children for a variety of reasons, **and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that**.  Breeding is not a logical process where you sit down with a balance sheet, it is the primary drive for every life form in the Universe.

And more to the point, poverty takes a huge toll on mental health and other factors.  This is why substance abuse and domestic abuse are much more prevalent in households below the poverty line than above it.  Long term planning is not a strength of the depressed and the downtrodden when faced with a decision with short term happiness.

Almost everybody looks down on the working classes, both Tory and Labour alike.  You only need to go into the other thread on this subject to read what the mostly white, mostly young, mostly male and mostly middle class reddit audience thinks of ""the average voter"" or working class voters who refuse to vote for the current Labour Party.  They only like the working classes who do what they tell them to do, the rest are thick chav scum apparently.

This ""well just dont have kids 4Head"" stuff is yet more sneering at the poor.  The idea that if you were in their position then you'd use your superior intelligence to work out that having children costs money.

It's also factually wrong btw.  If you are on Universal Credit in the UK then you are MUCH better off having a child than not.  But in these conversations the reality very rarely matters when theres an opportunity for people to feel superior to the poor."
Poverty in a country as rich as the UK is unacceptable. I do not want any kid to starve.  How do we make sure these kids grow up to be financially able to support their own children?
It's a forever repeating social disaster.  It's unacceptable to have starving kids

And the water does get heated by the way.  They dont shut off your gas either if you have children, they work out a payment plan or put you on a meter which has emergency credit mechanism and after that runs out, you call the gas supply company who then have to further extend this.

Reminded me of a reddit argument. Just unnecessarily pointing out a slight inaccuracy to avoid responding to the actual point of the argument. And this is our actual welfare minister.
"Wasn't even a mistake. It's just that rich people are so out of touch with poor people. When someone like him says no water it probably means cold showers, not being able to pop the kettle on or turn on the washing machine because it costs so much."
The only person who believes that his whole argument is negated due to an inaccuracy is you.
">You’re an idiot he didn’t mean literally he meant they can’t afford to turn it on. Please don’t defend MP’s even if they’re technically right on minuscule irrelevant facts because this issue is so important.

If that's what he meant then he should be more precise in his language. ""Turned off"" implies that the utility company has severed a connection to their home. Which they are not allowed to do. Even if he was being metaphorical, can't you see how it could potentially be misleading to a lot of people given the size of Rashford's audience? 

Unless your goal is to create an echochamber, it is good to correct misinformation and accept when you were misinformed.

That's a separate argument and has nothing to do with the point you were making. You are using the emotional leverage of hungry children to hide the fact that a separate tweet was fake news.

All I can think of is wanting to carry on the bloodline but that’s a terrible reason to bring a child into poverty."
"I didn't say that chances are high just that they can be.

The chances are this small because the system is rigged against them. I understand that rich people's kids will get more opportunities and that is ok. But it is the government's responsibility to ensure that opportunities are available to poor kids to escape poverty. These opportunities can be provided them by taking away their very basic concerns such as ""Will I get something to eat today?"" and ""Will I have a roof over my head next month?"". Then, they can focus on their education or football practice and lift themselves out of poverty."
"How is he bragging? It's an issue that affected him as a kid and managed to escape it playing football.

True true. I want Arsenal to sign him because he is such a gem. Not meant seriously.

On a serious note, I just love how he doesn't want kids to go through what he himself went through, and he's doing everything to change that. Don't know who his parents are, but they raised a great person that English kids will look up to and want to emulate. Well done."
So if the player isn’t playing for your team or a rival team it means you can’t appreciate him? Wishing him success over your team can be considered wrong but wishing him success when your team isn’t involved is totally fine.

I do agree that every kid SHOULD have the same opportunities. But sadly your background steers your life to some direction: children of poor parents tend to become poor too and vice versa. Sons of single mothers are more prone to violent crimes and going to prison. Children of rich people tend to get better education and better opportunities.

">Actually wait, maybe it’s not a valid point. Maybe it’s a downright moronic one.

How so... families provide stability and being alone is strain for many even without a kid. This isn't about being heteronormative and its not about morality. Having multiple family members or multiple generations nearby help a lot. A uncle that can drop by with dinner or an cousin that can help with homework can make a huge difference.

Sure we could. Then we could get the massive MNCs to pay their tax as well. I'm not sure it's even possible to get that done, even if we did have a government that was into that kind of thing.

> Of all the defences of the government... ""£40 million quid ain't really that much"" is probably the worst I've ever seen.

Not trying to defend the government (fuck the tories), more like trying to point out the enormous financial black hole we're currently in. Taxes are going to have to go up for *everyone* to pay for this mess."

"I felt it was unecessarily antagonistic, and didn't really make the point I was trying to."
"Fair enough, my response was aimed more at the guy who made the point that you said was a fair one. You might not share that exact view I guess.

Ultimately I just think we should be talking about fixing the broken system rather than penalising people for daring to break the ‘2 parent nuclear family’ mould. Especially given the fact that fatherlessness, much like food insecurity, is a symptom of the problem."
"Yeah, I agree that it’s observably easier to raise children with 2 parents and extended family around. No question.

My problem with the point being made further up was that it put the blame/responsibility for the situation on those affected - the single parent and the child - and that just comes off as severely lacking in empathy. What if someone needs to escape an abusive relationship and take their children? What if someone just leaves?

Ultimately we shouldn’t be making ‘gotcha’ comments about fatherlessness to put the blame back onto those communities, when we have more than enough resources in this country to ensure that no child grows up without food security, regardless of their parental situation."
"Again, he said ""turned off"", not ""cut off""."
It's not actively bashing those who do less but praising those who go out of their way to do more.
"My statement is that it isn’t unless your team is involved.

For example, I’m a cule who has a soft spot for Liverpool and always did which is a European rival. A team that represents unity of the Working Class and play great football (not quite like City did but great nonetheless)"
"i'd rather be a plastic than a cunt, but that's just me"
"So when you said ""FSM never ran over the holidays before"" that was untrue. 

With regards to the MNCs, we dont have a government not into it. We have a government actively helping them avoid taxes. 

Financial black holes for national governments arent a household budget. It isnt a simple case of not spending to make ends meet.

I'm not arguing semantics here. Let me spell it out for you.

If there are children in a household, the water and gas supply will flow freely and uninterrupted, even if the bills have not been paid."
He's going out of his way to publicly do more. Doesn't quite feel the same as when a player doesn't do it for attention.
"Plastics are cunts, ruining football"
[removed]
"Yeah, you and I are lucky. Some people are less so, through no fault of their own. Poverty is systemic and traps people, and the level of poverty that exists in a ‘wealthy’ nation like the UK is embarrassing."
"That’s *effectively* what was being said though, by switching the focus from a failing system to individual family circumstances.

Of course it’s easier with more than 1 parent. But single parent families have always existed and always will exist, for a variety of reasons, and to act like that is the primary issue rather than systemic poverty is just stupid, before you even get into the ethics of it.

And no, properly funding social services and school meals (Rashfords point) etc are not nearly the same as a global pandemic bringing the economy to a total standstill and necessitating government stimuli. Especially when public money is being pissed up the wall on fatuous Brexit advertising among other things. Use sensible arguments please."
"This is simply not true, with households fitted with pre-payment meters overwhelmingly disadvantaged (for gas specifically.). 

Water I have no issue with, no cut-off on that regardless of financial hardship. However the monies are still owed regardless of affordability."
"> Doesn't quite feel the same as when a player doesn't do it for attention.

I don't quite understand what you're saying?"
I hope you realise that raising awareness of an issue is a huge part of solving the issue
"Pipe down. There is no possible negative to what Rashford's doing, even if you think it's a PR exercise it's spreading awareness and actually creating public pressure on the MPs to act instead of just pushing it aside. 

Where in the article he's written did you think, ""he's doing this for himself""? It's pretty clear he's passionate about the cause because at one point he himself was one of the kids he's trying to help.  


This is such a dissappointing sentiment, especially coming from a United fan, I can't see how you can dislike anything about rashford."
[removed]
So what is the current UK government's stance on the issue? Do they want to close the gap or do they not care about the gap
"You clearly don't have a clue what you're talking about, so please stop talking bullshit.

Your water supply cannot be cut off for non-payment of bills, regardless of whether children are living in the house or not. Your gas supply will not be cut off for non-payment of bills if you have children in the house (but it can be if only adults live in the house, not including pensioners)."
Doing good things just for the sake of it is more respectable than doing good things and letting everyone know what you just did.
"To be honest, I generally don't believe raising awareness for something is doing much. I didn't say it was negative, I'm just simply saying that players who do stuff outside the spotlight probably deserve more praise.

I'm simply debating that point, given the context of the chain."

""Pickle Donald agrees?!"""
"But, if you look at the situation, with a broader image, the title would be ""Trump Mocked for his Tweets"".

He tweets so much instead of performing his duties, he doesn't seem to realize what he is tweeting. He seems impulsive and his tweets are. People are trigger-happy to call his retweeting and replying to himself a sign of dementia (when there are so many other, better symptoms of dementia that he displays), I think he just wasn't paying attention, because he was so happy to find to see his thoughts in words."

That's all you need, Huffpo. In fact that could be the title for almost any article from the last three months. He's such a tremendous douchebag. Remember the ""super duper missile""? It was at that point it became impossible not to think of Trump as an international laughingstock.

This is just another instance of that.

"I am not a twitter user but when I clicked on a video yesterday it lead me to twitter and had a bunch of his tweets in the thread.

"Option 1: dementia is a hell of a drug.

Option 2: multiple people are writing his Twitter and one fucked up."
Why did this happen after finish reading a book about Trump's biography 2 days ago?
He could at least create a sockpuppet like other trolls do.  He can't even social media right.
I used to like my own comments on Facebook back in the day cause I thought it was hilarious when people would point out that I’m liking my own comments. I did it for my own shits and giggles. Bunker Boy over there is just off his rocker though.

I hate Trump a lot but this just seems like he’s reiterating the first tweet
"Aside from the stupidity of it all, this is such an old-person-on-social-media thing to do. One of the many reasons I got off Facebook was seeing old relatives, or friends of my parents, or parents of friends doing shit like this. They see some stupid “meme” that is essentially a low effort “comedic” hot take on whatever social issue is trending at the moment. “So true!” “Amen!!” The second hand humiliation was too much for me."

I feel like if I said half the things he has said I'd be in a mental institution.
I agree with this!

Trump obviously forgot to switch to his alt account before agreeing

Anyone else *worried* that he used the term 'silent majority'? Like all the other people who were silent for Hitler helped him come to power.
Just an old man doing old man shit on the internet. Why do we keep electing these dinosaurs?
Grandpa is off his rocker.
He does this like at least 3x a week.
"When the President tweets people should read them and take what he says seriously. We have a direct link to the President. This is unprecedented. There has NEVER been a President that has been so available to the American people--he doesn't get enough credit for that. He truly is for the people, no matter what the liberals say. I hope eventually he gets his own dollar bill, maybe replace Franklin or Jackson.

"Here's a quote if you follow one of the links in your article


>Trump, Dec. 2: I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, “The America We Deserve,” and I said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden. I mean I really study this stuff. I really find it very interesting, and even though I’m a businessman I find it —  I’ve always found, I’ve always been involved in politics — I said we better be careful with Osama bin Laden. There’s a guy named Osama bin Laden. Nobody really knew who he was. But he was nasty. He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it. And I wrote in the book [in] 2000 — two years before the World Trade Center came down — I talked to you about Osama bin Laden, you better take him out. I said he’s going to crawl under a rock. You better take him out. And now people are seeing that, they’re saying, “You know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden” – which actually is true. And two years later, a year and a half later he knocked down the World Trade Center."
People voted for this person.
Simple Jack?
Sounds like Zapp Brannigan.
"""I think I'm much more humble than you could understand.""

This is sadly also a real quote
https://youtu.be/1R42mFx3_ss"
"Uh, Obamagate, it’s been going on for a long time. It’s been going on from before I even got elected and it’s a disgrace that it happened, and if you look at what’s gone on and if you look at now, all this information that’s being released — and from what I understand, that’s only the beginning — some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again. You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.

Another [real quote](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/columns/clarence-page/ct-column-trump-obamagate-biden-page-20200515-sjics3of4zcmpmizbtjsmrlj54-story.html%3foutputType=amp), and personally my favorite because he literally is just bullshitting (poorly)."
" Holy shit, I was so convinced that link was going to send me to Rick Astley!"
Whats number two?
"What, is he being Trumpy?"
"""Good brain""......"
I can believe that it's more aerodynamic than most.
I've worked extensively with psychiatric patients in the past and haven't really heard much that's crazier than this.
These are the actions of a stable genius; it's true.
He has the best dementia folks.
"Yep.  But his worshippers will insist that *he was joking*!  ‘What, ya never heard of sarcasm, silly?’  Ha ha ha, what a funny guy."
"its just Dan ""shitstain"" Scavino."
"I’m putting money on trump having alt accounts that he switches to for the truly vile shit. We saw other politicians alt accounts uncovered a few months back. 

Trump seems like the person that would have an alt account to agree with himself while also liking porn tweets like ted Cruz did on 9/11."
Mitch replaced him with a robot
"> he is just making a fool of himself as he always does.

SO TRUE!"
All of the above?
"> So Trump is either losing it

Can't lose what you never had!"
"It’s pretty well established that he is not the only one who tweets from that account, right? So, sad as I am to admit, probably the most obvious (and boring) explanation is that he didn’t remember tweeting the first thing because he didn’t personally do it."
All of the above! It's always all of the above.
I like to think he’s a narcissistic goldfish who just saw his reflection in the mirror.
">to the John Barron and John Miller accounts

David Dennison feels hurt and ignored."
To be fair he is always forgetting Barron
A presidential burner account.  2020 is wild.
Honestly this article could have been an onion post. I guess he really is losing ass eaters if he only has himself to retweet.
"He’s not “unwell”. 

He’s done shit like this his whole life.

He’s a sociopath."
"You guys should do some silent protest and send him get well soon cards, tweets, flowers etc."
"Yeah bro, so true. You have the best hair ever, btw."
Another level of narcissism?
This right here.
"I’ve only looked at his Twitter a handful times before needing eye bleach, but it seemed like someone just buried his insanity in retweet’s."
I agree!
So true!
So true!
">Well, he's a moron.

So True!"
"My mind took off on the idea of evil interdimensional trump like some entity from event horizon, but then I remembered that's what inhabits this dimension. The other dimension one is probably a pretty nice guy who is eternally tortured by the hellscape around him. Good, fuck that guy."
"> It was at that point it became impossible not to think of Trump as an international laughingstock.

I think we passed that line during his campaign, when he was being mocked internationally."
Or he just thinks it's normal to do this.
What voices? It's a monologue in there.
"""I'm not the sock puppet.  You're the sock puppet."" - Trump

""Yeah, what he said!"" - also Trump"
So true!
Sarah Sanders does that too I think. She’s got that baseball hat that says ‘World’s Largest Supply of Natural Gas’.
"I imagine that Trump saw that and thought, ""if obama can do that, i can, too"" without an ounce of scrutiny that someone else created that meme."
So true!
Singing Parakeet 2020!
So true!
So true!

"“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”"
"""The voices told me to nuke seattle"""
"Well they don't want to turn the public against establishment policies, they just want to turn the public against the GOP, most of the bad policies trump had these past few years, will most likely still be held in place by the dems if they get a hold of the WH. Most of the corporations who donate big money and lobby, do it for both parties so they don't care who is in the WH as long as they can be bought."
"Along with ""a lot of people are saying it"""

"He tells it like it is while simultaneously making it all a joke... So serious, so funny!"
"My favorite is ""he's just trolling"". That's their go to response whenever he says something moronic."
"Reporters print exactly what Trump said or tweeted.

""That's FAKE NEWS! he was only joking!""

that's...that's not what 'fake' means."
Exactly what I'm looking for in a leader
Like when he jokes about maybe having more time in office than 2 terms! *Hilarious*.
"It'll be like that ""injecting bleach and light"" thing where people were like ""what those kind of therapies exist, so he's being reasonable"" then he'll say ""gotcha I was being sarcastic and joking anyone who agreed with me is stupid"" then, when everyone who agreed with him is like ""/me mouth hanging open"" he'll be like ""just kidding I was being double sarcastic Mr. Adams, and I'm playing 4d chess and you're not dumb for following me, draw me some cool comics"""
How about all 3?
"Supposedly there's a Tiffany Trump as well. But it seems more like an urban legend than anything, really."
"Sociopaths aren't immune to dementia.

And it's pretty obvious at this point that Trump brain is mush."
"I read  too fast and my mind inserted carrots among cards, tweets, flowers, so a bouquet of carrots will work? 

I mean carrots improve health and dangling one is a symbol of manipulation."
"I think he’s unwell, but Trump was already the type of person that would re-tweet himself and be proud of it."
"Yeah, okay, you've earned that upvote"
You can't just agree with yourself!
And without wondering why there are two obamas in the picture.
"I honestly wouldn't be surprised if his plan to stop the protests involved a mulatto, an albino, a mosquito and his libido."
"Actually, this is the most rational explanation that I've heard for the last four years."
Yes but since there's no testing for it you didn't catch it. See how that works?
COVFEFE-19
Hopefully everyone wears a mask when reading his tweets.
My brain just made the Windows 98 shut down sound trying to read this.
What does this even say.
"Child detention centers?

I mean, if this isn't like one of Biden's first week of executive orders, I'm going to be upset, but I also don't see why he or corporate sponsors would want to keep it"
[deleted]
"Or when his ""friends"" call him to tell him the unbelievable job he's doing"
At best this means he heard it on Fox and Friends that morning.
You mean the same Bin Laden that is ON CLARISE STARLING'S computer screen as one of the FBIs 10 Most Wanted in the February 2001 movie HANNIBAL?
Trump never figured anything out about Bin Laden. He is full of shit.
"This one is not bad either:

>“People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it — you’ve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base ; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it’s funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the Electoral College. Big, big, big advantage. … The Electoral College is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall.”"
"At that, who wants a president that trolls on twitter? Like it’s one thing if the president cracks a joke or tweets a meme but to be happy a president may or may not be purposely making an ass of himself for “the lols” or to “school the libs” or whatever is scary"
Oh you didn’t know? Fake News is anything true that makes trump supporters uncomfortable.
“To a lesser extent.”
"Well, she’s also the smartest one, as she was able to distance herself (somewhat) from this sociopathic family"
"Out of sight, out of mind."
"Oh shit, the one that did the PPAP dance. I had completely forgotten that both she and the dance existed."
"Combine with random ""CHINA!"" tweets.

It's absurd people think he's intelligent."
"Wait, that was more than once?? What the hell is wrong with this moron?"
Another show that’s about to get cancelled by Color of Change
So ironic.  How many times in the past three years has he undermined the law and order?
"""Yes Donnie, that's a TV show"""
I wonder what the first time he declared bankruptcy was like.
Did I see that he had one of those tweets pinned? Like it was some amazing statement to be highlighted.
I kept seeing people reply with other TV show names. I thought they were just replies to the original until I realized they were new LAW AND ORDER tweets every day.
He looks like he's been run through a dehydrator between photo one and photo 2.
"But it’s high-quality mush, really the best mush around — I’ve talked to the top mush experts — that’s really just me, if you want to get into it, I’m a tremendous expert — did you know that I once had a pageant for mush? CNN won’t tell you that, we all know why — they say I have a mush brain, but what do they know, they’re just fake news — unlike me. Anyway, my mush is the world’s best mush and the Mushier Image is the only place you can buy it."
So true! It completely devalues the original statement
"Don’t you sully the good name of Nirvana with Trump!

EDIT: Also for some reason I imagine Trump not listening and maybe not even liking music as a whole"
Smells like Trump spirit.
"It says the president has a 3-cylinder engine and a busted transmission, but keeps hammering on the gas with a microphone stuffed up his tailpipe.

All noise, no action, and definitely no results."
"If Joe doesn't get carpal tunnel from executive orders his first week, I'm going to be upset.

I think it's a terrible precedent to set, but I hope he undoes as many of trumps policies as possible. Erase him."
I just hope that people realize this when they vote their representatives/senators. We had this problem in spain for a lot of years (it's still an issue in a lot of places).
"""Unbelievable""

"Law & Order was cancelled like 10 years ago, they just managed to really milk the almost 500 episodes for re-runs really well and remains on air every day.

And I very much doubt Trump watches SVU, since in his mind he's always the special victim, and would find the notion of investigating sexual assault to be a foreign enough notion that he would surely have tweeted about it and called it fake news by now if he actually watched that."
"It's funny that you mention this. Years ago I watched one of those shows as filler when I didn't have something else to watch. One day I found myself rooting for a cop to violate someone's 4th amendment rights. I won't go so far as to say they intend to desensitize people to the concept the police violating people's rights, but I stopped watching all cop-shows since. It wasn't immediately for some moral outrage reason or anything like that, but it just felt like I was watching propaganda after that, and I stopped enjoying the show. It was SVU I think."
Like Michael Scott: “I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!”
"He pins the latest one, he’s been doing that all week too"
I dunno. Trump thinks we should be soaked in bleach to kill the Rona.
He seems to like The Village People.
Trump already set that precedent with his suite of EOs to undo Obama's terms as much as he could.
">>he’s always the special victim

LOL fuck"
"SVU has been going on so long,  the main character adopts a baby and has off screen developed to the point she's going to college and they're now creating a spinoff series about the offscreen baby that timeline wise is a full adult."
"Now, when you say ""special""..."
"It's called copaganda, and it's no accident."
"> One day I found myself rooting for a cop to violate someone's 4th amendment rights

I routinely root for unsanctioned, criminal vigilantes to  extrajudicially and sometimes pre-emptively execute people purely for the sake of catharsis. In TV shows and movies, of course.

I mean yes, be aware of developing unhealthy prejudices and remain cognizant of your societies failings but there's nothing wrong with vicariously enjoying socially unacceptable actions of protaganists in fictional works."
"Dude this is a very real part of the indoctrination of our country. 

As someone who stopped watching all broadcast and cable tv almost 10 years ago now, all it takes is a few mins of cop show to make me queasy and upset ."
"The police are real. They really can violate rights, and we should find that action abhorrent when it's done. You're free to watch whatever you'd like, but I just couldn't get any enjoyment out of it afterwards because all I saw were the things the writers were portraying as good and just, that I would find horrific if it were done to someone I care about. 

The ADA in that show is (was?) almost always the voice of reason trying to keep the police from violating rights, and she was portrayed as someone getting in the way of justice.

Once I saw it, I couldn't un-see it. YMMV"
"Glad there’s others out there. I used to love these shows. Then one day I realized that despite them always getting the bad guy, they often did so did so in immoral ways. 
For me, I can’t even watch murder she he wrote, which my wife loves, because I feel like they’re constantly suggesting people forfeit their 5th amendment rights."
"I get that. I just never got the impression shows like SVU successfully portrayed cops as universal ""good guys"" in the strictest sense. They always do some dumb emotionally charged (and probably illegal) shit for the sake of drama.

And personal experience tells me ADAs are often the opposite of what you see on the show.

But then again all the Law and Order shows have always been just light entertainment for me and I can't honestly say I've really considered them too much beyond that.

I'm not disagreeing, by the way. I guess I just see them differently."
"You can't put something into your brain and expect it to be isolated. Unless you believe propaganda or marketing just don't actually work, you should be concerned at what the things you watch are doing to your brain. *Especially* the things you watch *without* analysis.

I'm not even suggesting that the writers are doing it on purpose or anything so nefarious. 

And yes, with SVU at least, they did show that the cops sometimes were thwarted and the people's rights prevailed, but those cops were the protagonists; you are made to feel that they are being wronged somehow by being forced to follow the law. 

They weren't even very good shows. I don't know that my life was made any worse when I stopped watching. 

But, and I cannot stress this enough, you do you, man. I'm just offering a personal anecdote."

Comment
"I think the problem is you are thinking of ""infinite"" to be ""a very big number"".  It is not a very big number, it's a different kind of thing.  A similar problem exists with zero, in that it's not just ""a really small number"", it's actually zero.  For example if I take a really small number like 0.0000001 and double it, I get 0.0000002.  If I take 0 and double it, I still get zero.  2x0 is not bigger than 1x0.  If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then they are separated by 0.  If I double all of those numbers, then they are separated by 2x0, so they are still separated by 0."
"Here's a way to see that there are the same ""size"". We're going to show that for each number between 0 and 1, there exists a number between 0 and 2, and vice versa.

1. Pick any number between 0 and 1.
2. Multiply it by 2.
3. You now have a number between 0 and 2.
4. Vice versa, pick any number between 0 and 2
5. Divide it by 2.
6. You now ave a number between 0 and 1.

This works both for the case of rational and real numbers. We just constructed a so-called bijection between the intervals \[0,1\] and \[0,2\]."
"Your intuition for size comes from the structure of intervals, rather than the amount of elements they have. The intervals [0, 1] and [0, 2] have the same quantity of points, because you can pair them up. However, the interval [0, 2] is twice as long as the interval [0, 1]. The particular elements within [0, 2] and their relation to each other is what gives it that long, not the amount of elements."
"Well, two things are happening here. There are different kinds of infinities, some of which are larger than others. However, the number of real numbers between 0 and 1 is the same as the number of real numbers between 0 and 2.

You can prove this second one by creating what's called a bijection - showing that for every member of group A there is exactly one member of group B. This is easier to show with another set but it does carry over into this situation.

Let's say we're comparing every even number with every even AND odd number. It seems like the second one should be larger, right? But if we take every even number and divide it by two, we go from 0, 2, 4, 6... to 0, 1, 2, 3... That sure looks like the set of all even and odd numbers.

The same thing applies here. If you take every real number between 0 and 2, and divide them all by 2, you get every real number between 0 and 1.

There is also a way to show that some infinities are larger than others. This one is a bit harder to picture, but imagine a list of every real number between 0 and 1. This is every rational number, but also every irrational, every transcendental, every number that is between all of those forever. It's not obvious how you could sort such a list but let's say you just write down the numbers randomly.

Well, this is a list that you can order 1, 2, 3 etc. Sure, it's infinite, but so is the list of counting numbers. Right now there's no obvious problem; if they're both infinite, you're good to say that they're the same size.

However, we can do something that breaks this. Let's create a new number; the rule is that it's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place, and so on forever. This is definitely a real number, meaning it should be on the list, but it's definitely not on the list, since it's different from every number on the list in at least one place. Even if you added this new number to the list, you could just do this again.

What we've done is shown that, even if we use all the counting numbers, all infinity of them, we can still create numbers that are not on that list and for which there is no matching number. There are numbers left over after we've used all the counting numbers. Even though they're both infinite, there are *more* real numbers than there are counting numbers.

I hope this makes sense."
"The concept of size that’s used for infinite sets is basically this: Two sets are the same size if you can pair the members from one up with the members of the other with no leftovers. You can do that with the two sets OP asked about, so they’re actually the same size. But you can’t do that with the set of all integers and the set of all numbers between 0 and 1."
"This is actually pretty interesting because there are the same number of numbers between 0 and 1 and 0 and 2. Vsauce did videos that explains this much better than I can in a reddit comment: [Banach–Tarski Paradox, directly related to question](https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA), and [How To Count Past Infinity](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88)"
"The rule is that if you can match up each number of two sets 1:1, then sets have to be the same size.  E.g. the set of whole numbers between 1 and 10 is the same size as the set of EVEN numbers between 2 and 20.  Why? Because you multiply each number in the first set by 2 and you get exactly the second set.  1 gets matched to 2, 2 get matched to 4,.... and so on.

In the same way the infinite (0, 1) set matches the set (0, 2) by multiplying each number by 2."
"The thing which helped me wrap my head around it (as much as I have) was when it was explained to me that infinity is not a number. Being infinite is a property of a set. 

So if you consider it as a different property - like “blue”, or “hot” - it makes more sense. You can’t count to blue, and whether one set is bigger than another doesn’t affect whether it is blue or not."
I asked this exact question out of curiosity to my math teacher in 9th grade around 7 years ago. She said I shouldn't ask silly questions and focus instead on the homework assignment. Fuck you Karen I was just curious
"I don't know if its relevant but if you have infinite 10$ bills and on the other hand have infinite 100$ bills, their value will be the same.
This is why i love mathematics, still not good at it."
"You question is basically fighting with the concept of infinity.  Infinity means ""unbounded.""  There are not more number between 0-2 than 0-1 because there is no way to count them and end up at a resultant count.  The numbers between those ranges are no longer countable because there is no end to the numbers between those two ranges.  It goes on forever.  Literally, forever, infinite.

How do you find out which hole is deeper if both holes have no bottom?"
"It is interesting how many misconceptions about infinities, or about numbers more generally, stem from the mistake idea that infinity is a member of the set of integers, rather than its cardinality.  So endless mistaken stuff happens because people have the idea that there are arithmetic operations on integers (or rationals, reals) that yield “infinity”.   The most common is the idea that n/0=inf, but also concepts which boil down to there being an n such that n+1=inf or distinguishable infinities such that 2.inf_1=inf_2 where inf_1<inf_2 (or at least not equal, and distinguishable).  All of these fail for endless reasons, but explaining why they fail is hard unless you can convince people of the bijection with integers (see above)"
"Those two infinities are the same size. For every number between 0 and 1, you can multiply it by 2 to get a number between 0 and 2. This transformation covers all numbers between 0 and 2, with no missing numbers. There are other infinities that are larger, and it’s not possible to map to larger infinities from smaller infinities in this way."
"It's about mappings. A mapping is a one-to-one equivalence between two sets.   
If you can find a way to ""partner up"" all the values from both sets so no matter what value you pick from either set, there's exactly one value in the other that you can pair it with, you have a mapping.   
   
So if we take a value from [0-1], and multiply by 2, that uniquely identifies a value in [0-2]. And conversely, if you take a value from [0-2] and divide it by 2, you'll find a unique value from [0-1].   
This is what we mean when we say they are the same size, it means that we can find a rule to convert values from one set to the other."
John Green? Is that you?
"Infinity is not a number but a concept. So while two counts are both infinite they are not the same, they just share the same concept of being infinite. So what you are saying is not contradicting each other."
"Look at the positive whole. We can count them. 1, 2, 3, 4, ... No matter what positive whole number you want to reach, you'll reach it eventually by counting. This set contains a 'countable infinite' number of elements.

Now look at all the (real) numbers between 0 and 1. Real numbers are all the numbers you can think of. Fractions like 1/2, but also numbers like 91,37382930401... and so on, with every digit being completely random. There is no way to count all those numbers in a similar way as for the whole numbers. (There is a way to count fractions, but I won't go into detail.) 

There is a finite amount of numbers in between two whole numbers. For example: in between 1 and 5, you have 2, 3 and 4. The same logic doesn't apply for real numbers between 0 and 1. There is still an infinite amount of numbers in between 0,3 and 0,48485938278... which can't be counted in a structured way, i.e. counting systematically with you eventually reaching any number in between those two. The set of real numbers contains an 'incountable infinite' number of elements. So there are more real numbers than there are whole numbers.

For the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 and the set between 0 and 2, it's easy to see they contain an equal amount of numbers as another comment has pointed out already. 

Fun fact: There is an infinite amount of levels of infinity, the number of whole numbers and the number of real numbers are the two lowest levels."
"Imagine having a rubberband and a ruler. You mark the distances 0 and 1.
Now you stretch the rubberband fixing the 0 until your ""1"" mark reaches a distance of 2.
Now every (infenitesimal) point on your rubberband marks a point on your new scale.
Same points (same set) but different scale."
How would there be more numbers  between 0 and 2 in the grand scheme if its infinite?
You're thinking about infinity wrong. Your OP has a false assumption in it. Some infinities are larger than others but I believe your examples are the same size infinity. Chime in math nerds
"There are not more numbers between 0 and 2 than there are between 0 and 1.

There is more distance between 0 and 2 than there is between 0 and 1."
"[0,2] is not larger than [0,1] since both are infinite, it contains [0,1] making it a superset.

In infinity ""larger"" ""smaller"" ""more"" ""less"" lose meaning, yes in some sense one is larger than the other, but both are infinite, one simply has elements that the other does not."
"My take. Infinity is a more abstract concept than a true numerical value.

If you have infinity $1, you have the same as infinity $100.

Your truck full of money might be bigger when you buy a house with $1 instead of $100, but your bank is untouched.

Infinite means, it never ends."
"I  could add to the fine descriptions here, but if you've got 24 minutes this is still my favorite descriptions of what you are asking and it stays pretty ELI5 friendly the whole time.

VSauce - How to count past infinity

[https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88)"
"The definition that mathematicians use to determine the size of a set is a generalization from what most people use. Say you have two sets of people 'A' and 'B'. They would say the sets have the same size if there is a pairing or map between the two so that everyone in 'B' can be paired to someone in 'A' and everyone in 'A' is paired to only one person from 'B'. If no such map exists, then the sets are different sizes. Cantor was able to show that no such pairing exists between the set of counting numbers, 1,2,3,..., and the real numbers, 1, 1/2, pi, etc. Hence, the sets are at least a different size. Then, since one set contains the other, it is natural to say one is bigger!

You must be careful though. Unfortunately, you cannot say that a set is larger than another just because it contains it. In your example, one can find such a pairing from the set of numbers between 0 and 1 to the set of numbers between 0 to 2, so they are the same size!"
"A professor once told me that ""infinite"" isn't a value. It's more of a state. That's why infinite + 2 = infinite and so on. Even infinite + infinite = infinite."
"Infinity is not a specific number. It is a broad concept that describes something without limit. It's like saying something is ""hot"". Two things can both be ""hot"" but one can be ""hotter"" than the other."
"The mass of the space between remains the same, the pieces are each smaller relative to the mass. So the set of infinite numbers of one 0 to 1 represents a smaller mass than 0 to 2. There are more pieces.   


It's like legos."
"What you're describing are points in a line.  You can divide 0-1 as many times as you can divide 0-2.  We simply use particular points in that line to mentally map what those points mean.

Neither set of numbers have ""more"" or ""less"" numbers; rather, our usual points of reference only make it seem that way, like an optical illusion fools our brains into seeing things in a way we can relate to.  In your example, there really is no more, or fewer, possible number of rational numbers in between. That's, fundamentally, what the word ""infinite"" represents; that there just isn't a mathmatical way to create a ""smallest"" unit of numbers."
Infinity is a concept not an actual number so it exists between the two numbers and beyond them as well.
"That's pretty much the definition of infinite -- it's the size of a set that is the same size of a proper subset of itself.

That was a key insight of Gregor Cantor -- the infinity paradox isn't a paradox, it is the definition of infinity."
"It’s not, they’re both the same size. 

For any number between 0 and 2 you can just divide that by 2 and it’ll be between 0 and 1. 

Same would work if you did 0 and 3 or 0 and 1,000,000 etc."
"Well, the easiest way I can think of to explain it is that infinity doesn't ever end. There are the same amount of numbers (infinite) between 0-1 and 0-2 because you won't even reach 1!"
"What do we mean when we say that one collection of objects is bigger than another? This is a surprisingly subtle question, so let's break it down.

For finite collections, this is not too bad. Let's say Alice, Bob, and Charlie are fighting over two apples. One might try to record who gets which apple:

* Alice is assigned apple 1
* Bob is assigned apple 2

There are other ways to do this assignment, but in no case do all three receive an apple! As there's no way to ensure everyone gets an apple, it makes sense to say that there are more people than apples. (A mathematician might say there are no *surjections* from apples to people.)

For infinite collections, this is how we can define the notion of 'bigger'. The usual mistake is to think that the interval [0,2] strictly contains [0,1], so it is 'bigger', but that is not the definition we are using! In fact, we can assign every number in the interval [0,2] a different apple labeled by numbers between 0 and 1:

* 0 is assigned apple 0
* 1 is assigned apple 0.5
* In general, x in [0,2] is assigned apple x/2

So [0,2] is *not* bigger than [0,1], and in fact, they have the same number of elements!

Side note: a number of responses assert that one cannot regard the infinity of elements as a number. But it is very much possible and useful to do [cardinal arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number#Cardinal_arithmetic) with these sizes of collections. It is not as simple as n * infinity = infinity though!

So how can one construct two infinities which are genuinely different? In other words, how do we come up with infinite sets A and B for which you cannot exhaustively assign to each element of B an element of A?

One example is the set of whole numbers {1, 2, 3, ...} vs the set of all numbers between 0 and 1. You can think of the assignment of whole numbers to numbers in [0,1] as an enumerated list:

* 1: Assign to x
* 2: Assign to y
* ...

There is a famous (but not ELI5) diagonalization argument by Cantor that you cannot list down all real numbers; one says that the collection [0,1] is *uncountable*."
"Hilbert's Infinite Hotel. Go search that on youtube. It's fun.

Let's say you have an hotel with an infinite number of rooms and a guest in each room. A bus with infinite new guests arrives. Our hotel manager asks each guest in a room to move to the room twice their current room number. guest in room 1 goes to room 2, room 10 goes to room 20, room 1024 goes to room 2048 and so on. The guests from the bus now take up all the odd numbered rooms that are now empty.

1) From a finite perspective, there are now ""twice"" as many guests in the hotel compared to before the bus arrived.

2) This is not a valid perspective. The end result after the bus arrived is still a hotel with infinite rooms and a guest in each room.

3) Infinities are weird that way."
"This also begs the existence of the actual numbers themselves- if the space between them is infinitely large, how can they possibly exist as a discrete & static value of an infinitely shrinking & moving target?"
"You cannot add or subtract infinite . I will give an example : there are an infinite amount if numbers greater than one. For each individual number x you can write 1/x and get an unique number between 0 and one..so the rows have the ‘ same amount’ ?
Alternatively you can also say for each number between 0 and 1 you can add +1 and get the same amount of numbers between 1 and 2.. or add +2 and get the same amount of numbers between 2 and 3 etc ... so you have a sum of equal infinite rows right? And it must be “larger” ? 
However the first postulate still applies..."
"If you are talking about real numbers, then there are an equal amount of numbers between any opened interval of R. In other words (1,2) has the same cardinal as (0,2). 
Sets of infinite numbers are compared by finding functions that have one of the sets you’re trying to compare as domain and one as codomain. If you can find a bijective function between the two (a function that uniquely identifies an element from the domain with an element from the co-domain), the intervals/sets have the same cardinal (no of elements).

Say we have (0,1) and (1,infinity).
We have the function f(x)=1/x that uniquely maps an element from the first interval to one of the second interval (and no element from both sets is unmapped by the function f), thus f is bijective and the intervals have the same number of elements."
"Imagine you have two groups of people and want to know whether one of them is bigger. You could count both groups and compare the numbers, but it's slow and prone to errors. So you have a better idea: you tell each member of group A to find a member of B. If there's nobody left at the end, both groups are equal. The way you assign each member of group A to a member of group B with nobody being left out is called a bijection. 

Bijections can be used to compare the sizes of infinite sets. For the case of the numbers between 0 and 1 and the numbers between 0 and 2, you can assign each number from [0,1] to its double. There isn't any number left from any of the two sets, so both are the same size.

However, some infinite sets are larger than others. For instance, the set of all numbers between 0 and 1 is bigger than the set of natural numbers (0,1,2...). Mathematicians have proven that it's impossible to find a bijection between both groups. There are more numbers between 0 and 1 than there are natural numbers: you can assign each natural number to a number between 0 and 1, but some numbers between 0 and 1 will be left out. 

When there's a bijection between any set and the natural numbers, the set is called countable. For example, the integer numbers are countable: you assign 0 to 0, 1 to 1, -1 to 2, 2 to 3, and so on. When there's a bijection between a set and the real numbers, it's called uncountable. [0,1] is uncountable.

All the sets you can imagine right now are probably either countable and uncountable. But people have been able to create sets larger than the real numbers. However, nobody's been able to create a set of a size between the natural numbers and the real numbers."
"In math, when dealing with infinite sets, our traditional notion of a set being ""bigger"" or ""smaller"" in terms of having more members breaks down. Even though there are demonstrably ""more"" numbers between 0 and 2 than there are between 0 and 1, the two sets are the same ""size"" as far as how many numbers are in the two sets.

Think of it this way: you have a 1-inch long piece of Play-Doh. You take that piece of Play-Doh and stretch it out to 2 inches. Even though your piece of Play-Doh is twice as long as it was before, it's still made up of the same ""amount"" of Play-Doh because you didn't add more pieces of Play-Doh or cut out any -- all you did was stretch."

Basically the gist is that for any given line or line segment, regardless of length, there are the same amount of 'points' on the line, and each can be held 1:1 with a point on the other line.

Draw a horizontal line, then draw a bigger line under it.  Now use the ends of the long line to draw a triangle, that meets up above the smaller line (which is now in the middle of the triangle connecting the 2 sloped sides).

You can draw a line from the tip of the triangle, down through the short line, and it will connect with the equivalent point on the larger line at the bottom.

"Infinite basically means more than we can count, so...
Imagine you can only count as high as 5. Anything more than that would count as ""infinite""

So if you have 6 marbles in a bag, there are (in this context) infinite marbles.
But say you had 20 marbles in a bag, we know for a fact 20>6, but from the perspective of the man who can count no higher than 5, they both are infinite.

Now take this concept and just scale it way up!"
"There's 2 sets of infinite numbers:

-countably infinite, where every numbers corresponds to a ""step"" of infinity, so you can go to infinity, but only by going 1,2,3 etc.

-uncountably infinite, where you can go from 0 to 1 and keep finding numbers to infinity, purely because there are no defined ""steps"" which means that between ever new numbers you count, there are more in between. For example, you could start a 1, and then the next number you might count is 1.1, except between those there is 1.01, 1.0000000001 and 1.05, and the list keeps on going"
Theres different type of infinity . What you having in mind is absolute infinity . But in this case it's just the set between 0-1 . Refer to infinity hotel for all infinities .
"Think of it this way. Infinity is not a number but it's an idea. An idea that there exists a certain number which greater than an the number we could imagine. If you can imagine that number, write it down, infinity is a number bigger than that. Therefore even infinity+infinity is infinity. Infinity - Infinity is still infinity. So saying Infinite numbers exist between 0 and 1 and infinite numbers exist between 0 and 2 is basically the same thing and having ""more infinite"" numbers between 0 and 2 than in 0 and 1 is not actually the case"
Divide anything by the smallest fraction imaginable and divide by that again..over and over. Infinity is so hard for our brains to perceive because it's just way too much
"You're in a house with two magic rooms. Every time you enter Room 1, magically there is a new Point for you to find. The room will never run out of new Points. As such, expanding your search to include Room 2 won't get you any extra Points. Both Room 1 and Room 2 magically never run out of new Points so you'll find the same number of Points looking in Room 1, Room 2, or both Rooms."

"You draw a line from your town and the next town. There are infinite exact spots on that line where you could stand. 

Now you draw the line longer, now there are even more places you could stand."
"infinite is not a constant big number, it is a permanently growing number , so no, there is only one infinity and it is getting exponentially bigger every second."
"Because something can be infinite and not touch upon other infinity. Like a a line could be inifinite, but there could be infinite lines in 3d space that don't interact, or there could be infinite 3d objects in 4d spacetime. Higher and higher infinites. Thus we have 'higher' infinities."
"Imagine f(x)=bx function. X goes to infinity. f(x) goes to infinity too.

Now you got g(x)=kx. Which also goes to infinity.

If you divide f(x)/g(x) which both can have infinite values, you still get b/k result.

So both sets can be infinite; but at the same time then comparing them you can get constants. That's why infinities are same and infinitely different values at the same time."
"You can also get infinities of different sizes. The infinity of whole numbers is a magnitude of difference to the infinity of numbers to the first decimal point. Ie:
1 to infinity is ten times smaller than 1.0 to infinity (when increasing by .1)"
"There are different ""sizes"" of infinity. You don't actually need much math to demonstrate it. Consider a set of all things. Now consider a set of all things except Steve. Both sets are infinite, but one will contain one more thing than the other. Your question comes from a misunderstanding of infinite. It's not a number, so much as a modifier."
"Infinity isn't a number it's an idea of limits.

There are unlimited numbers between 0 and 1.

There are unlimited numbers between 0 and 2.

You can't say there are more or fewer numbers between 0 and 1 and 0 and 2.

In fact for any unique number between 0 and 1, you can find a unique number between 0 and 2. In this case it's as easy as multiplying by 2. This is called a mapping.

If you can find a unique mapping between numbers in two infinite sets you say the cardinality of the infinity is the same. Cardinality is just a fancy way of saying ""countability""

There are other kinds of infinities and cardinalities, but that's another question."

Imagine you have cookie and you can brake into as small as much pieces as you want. Now you have 2 more cookies and the same applys to them. No matter in how much pieces you break the cookies you will always know your first cookie is not as much as your other 2 and if there ever was an end too infinte you could brake 2 cookies in double as  much pieces as 1. Thats atleast how I understand it.
"I have no idea what's even going on here. But this is what I think. There are an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 1. Just as there an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 2. Every number between 0 and 1, all infinity of them exist in 0 to 2. There are also an infinite amount of numbers between 1 and 2. Since in whole terms the distance between 0 and 1 is the same as 1 and 2 then 0 to 1 has infinite amount if numbers and 0 to 2 has 2x infinite amount of numbers as 0 to 1. Which means buzz fucking lightyear was right. 2 infinity and beyond"
"Infinity doesn't show exactly the value of a number but rather its position. Since it's a set between 2 numbers, the one encompassing more countable entities has more places to spread over. Eg if you have a set of numbers between 1 and 10, and 1 and 20, but assume they're equal, it takes a longer time to count to the 20th position Vs 10th. Infinity by itself isn't a number or a value or an amount, it's more of an applicable concept that we use to explain things. It's about density of the collection of numbers."
There are infinite numbers between any two numbers.  Why just pick 1 and 2?
"Say that you have two classroom with some student in it. You want to know if their is the same number of student in both classroom. One way to do it is to go in one classroom, to count everyone in it, to go to the other classroom, to count everyone in it, and to compare the figures.

&#x200B;

Another way to do it, is to take one people of one classroom, one people of the other classroom, and to ask them to quit the classroom, until one of the classroom is empty.  If, at the exact same time, both classroom are empty, then it would mean that their is the same number of student in both classroom, isn't it ? By doing this, you have associate every student of the first classroom to EXACTLY one of the other classroom. In mathematical terms, you have created a ""bijection"" between both classroom.

&#x200B;

Now, let's say there is an infinite number of student in both room. It is thus impossible to just go in a classroom and to count everyone. However, it might still be possible to associate every student in one classroom to another classroom.

&#x200B;

For example, say that your first classroom is made of everyone between 0 and 1, and your second classroom is made of every number between 0 and 2. As said by r/TheHappyEater , you can create a link between every people in both classroom :

&#x200B;

"" Here's a way to see that there are the same ""size"". We're going to show that for each number between 0 and 1, there exists a number between 0 and 2, and vice versa.

1. Pick any number between 0 and 1.
2. Multiply it by 2.
3. You now have a number between 0 and 2.
4. Vice versa, pick any number between 0 and 2
5. Divide it by 2.
6. You now ave a number between 0 and 1.""

Thus, there is the same number of people in both set of numbers.

However, this is not always possible : you cannot create such a link between on one hand every number between 0 and 1, and on the other hand every integers, for example."
"Ok, I'll take a stab at this one. I've actually explained this a few times, and it's one of the most interesting topics in math to me.

The first thing you have to understand is that there are actually just as many numbers between 0 and 1 as there are between 0 and 2. I k ow that's hard to grasp, but we can prove it. 

In math when we say two sets ""contain the same number of elements"" what we mean is that for every thing in one set, we have exactly one corresponding thing in the other set and vice versa. So I'm the 0 to 1 and 0 to 2 example, for any number x that's between 0 and 1, we have a number 2x that's between 0 and 2 (and vice versa for x between 0 and 2 we have x/2 between 0 and 1).

But then, there *are* actually some infinite sets that are bigger than others. One example (the simplest) is that there are more real numbers between 0 and 1 than there are positive whole numbers (or negative, but let's ot worry about that right now). This one is a little trickier to prove, but i think the proof is beautiful. First let's think about what it would take for this to be false. That would mean that for every positive number, we would have a corresponding real number between 0 and 1. That means we could ""count"" the numbers between 0 amd 1, ordering them in such a way that with a theoretically infinite ount of time we could enumerate all of them. Our ordering would look something like this:

1: 0.abcde....

2: 0.fghij....

3: 0.klmno...

4: 0.pqrst...

And so on where each letter represents a digit. Now, we will show that this is impossible. We will show that no matter what we will miss at least one number. What is this number? Take the first digit of the first number, the second digit of the second number, etc. That will look like this:

0.agms...

Now add 1 to every digit in the number (if it adds to 10, just make it 0). This is now the number we have missed. It's not the first number because the first digit is different, it's not the second because the second digit is different, on to infinity for every number we listed.

We have just shown that it is impossible to make a ""one-to-one correspondence"" between the set of numbers between 0 and 1, and the set of positive whole numbers. You might say we could just add on the number we missed at the end, but you can't do that because there is no end. You might try to squeeze it in the middle, but then you can just construct a new number that you missed using the exact same process.

In the end, what this shows is that there are more real numbers than whole numbers. This is a very important fact. You might ask whether there is another set with more numbers than there are whole numbers, but less numbers than there are real numbers. This is a *very* complicated question. Answering it was actually proven to be impossible by Kurt Gödel, and it is known as the continuum hypothesis. It is one of the first examples of something in math that *cannot be known*, no matter how much we were to try.

EDIT: There's also a very related concept which is that of an ordinal number. Those require a bit more mathematical background to understand, but they are *basically* infinite numbers arising from orderings of infinite sets. You can do an odd sort of arithmetic with them, and they have some very interesting properties. That's a huge oversimplification, but it's kind of the idea."
"The concept of all specific numbers (0, 1, 2, 343.901) is that they define *that* specific quantity only. 1 apple means one single apple only. 2 apples means two single apples.

Infinity is not a number.

Infinity can be simplified (over-simplified?) to mean such a large quantity that it ""cannot be counted"". Infinity is ""uncountable"". 

So, there are ""uncountable"" numbers between 0 and 1, and ""uncountable"" numbers between 0 and 2. And whenever we have uncountably large number of things, we can say that it's an infinite amount."
Infinity isn't a number. There are the name number of even whole numbers as there are all whole numbers. Because both sets are infinite and can be directly mapped to each other.

"The issue you're struggling with is countable and uncountable infinity. There are in fact two kinds of infinity. The difference is that if you had an infinite amount of time you could reach the end of countable infinity

If you count up, 1,2,3,4,etc. and you had an infinite amount of time, then you could reach infinity.

If I try to count the numbers in between 0 and 1, there are an uncountable amount there. You can prove this by trying to find the starting point. So we want to start at the next smallest number after 0, but we can seem to find it. I can try by starting at 0.1 and adding zeros.

0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001

If I replace the first number with a 1, the second with a 2, you can see that I could have an infinite amount of time and I wouldn't even know the second smallest number"
"Those numbers are like a rubberband you can stretch as far as you want.

So you stretch it to be twice as long, but it still is the same rubberband."
"There actually aren’t more numbers between 0 and 2 vs 0 and 1. Both are infinite. The infinity of any interval of real numbers is the same. Where it becomes interesting is when you start considering rational numbers vs irrational or real numbers. Then you get into different types of infinity. The infinity of the real numbers is bigger than of the rational numbers even though there is a rational number between any two real numbers and vice Versace

"Called infinity+1 and it's quantity doesn't match it's quality. Meaning the amount is the same, but the scale or size of the numbers are different."

"I understand the issue, I actually thought I knew the answer, read almost all the comments and now I realise reality is a mere perception, the rules of math only suffice as long as the perceiver accepts a certain set of subjective guidelines, the moment someone questions the guideline it further complicates things."
"Between 0 and 1, you achieve 0.99999999 to infinity as it approaches 1. Between 1 and 2 you achieve 1.999999 to infinity as it approaches 2. As you can see, the first set is smaller."
"Because numbers are just imaginary values used in place of something. While there are a finite (but very large) number of things that make up the universe, there are an infinite number of concepts. So we could count higher than the number of atoms in the universe."
"That's because ""infinite"" is not a number, it's a concept. That's why 1*infinite = infinite, 2*infinite = infinite, etc etc. Since infinite is just a concept and it isn't countable, you can't say that a set of infinite numbers is larger or smaller than another infinite set :)"
"Because Infinity is weird is the simple answer. As you said, there's an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 1, and an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 2. Let's call the total amount of numbers between 0 and 1: A, and the total amount of numbers between 0 and 2: B. We have it where A is equal to some kind of infinity, whilst B is also equal to a kind of infinity. However as Infinity is weird, we can't use our normal math with it. Like we can't say A + A = B (despite it seeming obvious that the amount of values between 0 and 2 would be equal to the amount of values between 0 and 1, added to the amount of values between 1 and 2). Instead as there is a way to turn every value between 0 and 1 to 0 and 2 (by multiplying it by 2), then it makes sense to say there are the same amount of numbers.

All of this is quite tricky for a five year old though. It's tricky enough for adults.

"So. I'm gonna attempt to actually explain this as if I were talking to a kid cause more of these responses I can barely understand and I like to think I'm a slightly above the average person in intelligence.

Infinity is a complicated thing, i dont think humans can mentally comprehend so we need to break it down into something digestible. Rather than think of infinity as a quantity or a size think of it as a density. You have a cup of water and a cup sand. Both cups take up the same amount of space but one has a greater weight because its able to hold ""more"" You can get another cup and fill it with lead and it will get heavier still while still occupying the same space. The main difference being that with infinity is that there is nothing outside of the cup. And there is no end. If you tried to fill this ""infinity"" cup with an infinite supply of sand the cup would never be full and the pile of sand would never deplete.

But like. The issue I see is that infinity cant ever really have more than another infinity even if it seems like that should be the case. Because like. Its infinite. So what I told you was a lie, but its the only way i can understand it.

The issue with explaining infinity is it's like describing color to a blind person, and you are also blind? Like it exists and its everywhere but like. I couldnt tell you a damn thing about it. They could read off a list of pigments and and shit but what those pigments mean to a sighted person means nothing to these 2 blind people. Like this red is red 1 and this red is red 234 so red 234 must be more red than this red but what the fuck even is red? Yeah I'm swearing at a child cause like what the fuck. You dont even know what taxes are and youre trying to get into complex mathematical theories and concepts and I'm just trying to take a shit."
"This is the answer I understood the most. Thinking of infinity not as a group of numbers but as something entirely different in the way that zero is entirely different was the metaphor I needed.

People kept using an example where you divide a number by 2 or something and it kept losing me. Like, yes you have one of those numbers in 0-1, but you have both of them in 0-2, meaning you have more, regardless of how you arbitrarily divide it.

But thinking of infinity as a different concept outside of a series of numbers helped tremendously. Thanks for this."
"Yeah, this is the thing, but going even deeper - think of ""infinite"" as ""more than 5"" rather than a specific number.

So if you have ""more than five"" numbers between 0 and 1, and ""more than five"" between 0 and 2, it should be clear that both of those assumptions are true. And this is how we use ""infinity"" in math: a symbol of property (more than 5), rather than a specific number.

One word of caution: infinity is generally thought to be using much bigger number than 5 :)"
"I think the description of infinity as a ""different kind of thing"" than a number is the real key here. All this bijection stuff just leaves us mere mortals who deal with normal numbers of things scratching our heads. 

If you have an infinite set of numbers, and take every other one, you are left with -- an infinite set of numbers. I like the parallel with 0 -- if you double 0, you have -- 0."

If you chose a specific segment of the graph, for example 0<x<1 you could find infinitely many points on that line that would give you x,y coordinates.

But if you take any number between 0 and 1 and add 1 to it then you get a number that exists between 0 and 2 and 1 and 2 but doesn't exist between 0 and 1. Don't you? For the sake of my sanity please tell me you do!
Can you give an example of two intervals where this is not the case?
"Just to add to this, it is possible for one infinite set to be larger than another infinite set. 

~~An easy example is comparing integers (whole numbers with 0 included) and rational numbers (numbers that can be represented as a ratio of two whole numbers - ex. 1/3)~~

~~It’s easy to see that for every integer, the same number is present as a rational number. For example, 3 is the same as 3/1, and thus is both an integer and a rational number. However, not all rational numbers are integers. 1/3 is not an integer. Because you cannot match the numbers in a one-to-one fashion (like how TheHappyEater did above), you can say that one set is “larger” than the other despite both sets being infinite in size.~~

As the comments below mine said, I was wrong.  [Cantor's famous diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) showed that there are the same number of rational numbers and integers.  

A better example to look at would be irrational numbers (numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers) and rational numbers. Irrational numbers are ""uncountably infinite"" while rational numbers are ""countably infinite."" This is also based on the same proof from Cantor above. 

Sorry for the misinformation!"
"Yes. It is critical to understand that ""infinity"" is NOT a number. Infinity is a ""size"". Therefore the SET of real numbers between 0 and 1 is the same size as the set of real numbers between 0 and 2, which is less confusing since you are comparing the size of two sets,  not two numbers."

"I've never really bought the bijection idea. In this specific case, it is very clear that one set of numbers is a **subset** of the other. The larger set therefore necessarily has more members.  


The bijection at best just shows they're both the same \*type\* of infinity in that they share that relation."
But like how do you prove the same with a number between 0 and 1 and 0 and 3? Or do you have to multiply and divide by the upper limit?

"Just curious what's wrong with that: If I have a number #1 (rational and real) between 0 and one and add 1, then  I have a number #2 which is between 1 and 2. So for every number between 0 and 1 I have 2 numbers between 0 and 2."
Eli5? I'm 25 and the last bit lost me.
"Can you help me with something?

So I get this. I'm sort of on board. But what if someone argues that this doesn't prove that the set of infinite numbers from 0 to 2 is larger than 0 to 1, rather this person argues that the multiplying by 2 is just a scalar, and that there's still the same infinite set of numbers?"

"I don’t get how this is actually proof. With step 6, you still have a number between 0 and 2, this isn’t the case in step 3 when you multiply 0-1 by 2 though.

Look up to the sky and in comes an infinite number of aliens.  They hover in formation to end up directly above every other sheep which they beam up and bring back to their native planet to raise as pets or food.

Each alien ship takes one sheep, leaving every 2nd sheep still here on Earth. So, clearly there are more sheep than aliens in the universe, I mean, every alien had a sheep, but there were still more sheeps left. 

At least until they started eating the sheep, the final result of which will leave exactly the same infinite number of sheep on Earth as there are aliens on their home planet.

And forevermore, they keep coming here and stealing half of our sheep, leaving the same number for later."
"It's still not exactly clear to me what you're saying. Does this mean there are NOT more numbers between 0 and 2 as there are between 0 and 1, or are you saying the infinite set between 0 and 2 is indeed twice the size?"
"Consider the natural numbers – 1, 2, 3 and so on. They go on without limit. There are an infinity of natural numbers. Now ask, are there more natural numbers than even numbers? After all, the even numbers – 2, 4, 6 and so on – are contained within the natural numbers, interspersed with odd ones. 

It is tempting to say there are twice as many natural numbers as even numbers. But that’s wrong.

When we say two sets of objects are equal, we put them into correspondence on a one-by-one basis. For example, if I claim I have the same number of fingers as toes, I mean that for every one finger there corresponds one toe, with no toes left over and no fingers left unmatched at the finish. 

Now do the same for natural numbers and even numbers: pair 1 with 2, 2 with 4, 3 with 6, and so on. There will be exactly one even number for every natural number. The fact that each series forms an infinite set means the sets of numbers are the same size, even though one set is contained within the other! 

This result gives a definition of infinity: an infinite set of objects is so big it isn’t made any bigger by adding to it or doubling it; nor is it made any smaller by subtracting from it or halving it.

"I think he watched the movie ""a fault in our stars "" where they completely misinterpreted cardinality"
This is helpful

"So like... there's two doors, one goes to level 1, one goes to level 2. If [0, 1] and [0, 2] were staircases, they would go to different floors, but they'd be built with the same number of steps, but the steps themselves are different sizes when you compare them to each other?

To add to your description I find it helps to explain how we can tell two sets are the same size.

We can't count infinite sets, and one way to compare size is to count both sets and check to see if they are equal. Fortunately there is another way, matching each item of the set to an item in the other set, and only that item (I could never get my jections correct, ditto contra/covariant ). So if we can pair off the items until one set is exhausted, but the other isn't, we have proven one is bigger than the other. By how much we can't say, but bigger is bigger.

"Well, the 2•inf_1=inf_2 is *kind of* how ordinal numbers work, but that's a totally different thing."
"Cantor quite literally showed - proved - that the amount, the actual amount of numbers from 0-1 and 0-2 are the same. Infinities are about sets, a countable infinity vs uncountable infinities, Cantor proved that uncountable infinities weren't just bigger than countable ones, he proved they were *infinitely* bigger. And so this led to a sort of infinite regression problem that ultimately helped drive him insane."
"To expand on what you are saying:

Infinite is a concept, just like finite is a concept.  I want to point out here that this does not mean that infinite numbers do not exist.  They do, just like finite numbers exist.  The trouble starts when infinity is treated as a number instead of a category of number.  I also think that some folks, including teachers, get confused when they learn that infinite numbers are not in the set of Reals, and then start thinking that means that they are not ""real"", as in they don't exist.  Nice naming there Descartes!

Others have already talked about Cantor and the different sizes of infinity.  Another related point is that ordinal numbers (position) and cardinal numbers (count) split when you start considering infinite numbers.  This causes all sorts of headaches for people when they start considering infinite sets.  We are just used to treating these two things as being identical, because for finite numbers, they are identical for all practical purposes.

Finally, I want to reiterate what many have already said: the set of all numbers in (0,1) and (0,2) in the Reals have the same size.  That was what the OP asked, so I thought I should point that out here.  For some completeness, I'll mention that size of (0,1) in the Reals is larger than the size of (0,1) in the Rationals.  It doesn't apply to the original question, but it does remind us that there \*are\* different sizes of infinity, just as you said."
"Fun fact: While the number of whole numbers is the lowest level, we can't know whether the number of real numbers is the second-lowest level, or the third, or the (first infinity)th, etc.

It isn't just that modern math didn't manage to find the answer yet. We proved that we cannot find it. (Continuum hypothesis)"
"That's also what I remember. There are bigger infinities, but not in the example from OP."
"Your professor was not quite right.  In some places, it's a shorthand, like when doing summations and you want to say that you take ""all"" the numbers.  

But mostly, infinity is more like a category than a state, just like finite is more like a category.  There are different types of infinity, cardinality and ordinality break from each other, and all sorts of fun things start happening.

What's important is that none of these infinite numbers are part of the Reals, so you can't necessarily apply the rules that work with Reals to infinite numbers."
"Not true. The amount of numbers between 0 and 1 and between 0 and 2 are the same.

"> any interval of R

You sure about that? Does [0, 0] have the same cardinality as [0, 1]?"
"Yes there are? Even with advanced future technology you could always look at a supposed ""complete"" list of all numbers between 0 and 1, and suggest a number that comes between the first and the second."
"I still think the other example is still important to have for an intuition. Because the way we define if two sets have the same size is if you can pair up their elements exhaustively. So even if one set is a subset of another, as long as there exists some pairing of elements, they are the same size. This just happens to be a useful definition for mathematicians, and doesn't necessarily represent real world phenomena."
"What, like 7?  Is infinity 7?"
I finally managed to earn infinite money
"Well, the bijection stuff comes into play because there are different kinds of infinities out there.  When it comes to describing the size of infinite sets, we use bijections to determine if two infinite sets are the same ""size"" (or ""cardinality"" if you want to use fancy math jargon)

So because a bijection/mapping exists between the interval [0,1] and the interval [0,2], both intervals are ""the same size"".  A bijection/mapping also exists between the set of all natural numbers and the set of all rational numbers (via a process called Cantor's Diagonalization) so we say that both sets are the same size there as well.

However, a bijection/mapping does not exist between the set of all natural numbers and the interval [0,1], so we say that these two sets are not the same size.  Furthermore, it is clear that whenever you try to construct a bijection/mapping between the two sets, even after you exhaust all of the natural numbers you would still have an infinite set of left over numbers from the interval [0,1], so we can further say that the size of the set of all natural numbers is smaller than the size of the interval [0,1].  As such we say that the interval [0,1] is ""uncountably infinite"", while the set of all natural numbers is ""countably infinite"".  This clearly establishes that ""countable infinity"" is smaller than ""uncountable infinity"".

Mind you this just is just one way of looking at and categorizing infinities from the perspective of the sizes of infinite sets.  You could also look at and categorize infinities from the perspective of the limits of divergent functions.  

As an aside/tangent, there is also a perspective where you DO treat infinity like a number by adding it to the set of real or complex numbers (which we would call the ""real projective number line"" or the ""extended complex plane""). However doing this fundamentally changes the behavior of these numbers such that you must be careful how you do algebraic manipulations with them (you have to be aware of the indeterminate forms like infinity - infinity or infinity / infinity).  This is why we tell students ""infinity is not a number"", because life is really just easier that way."
"I think the zero stuff could be a bit misleading - 0 *is* a number, and you can treat it as a number and do numbery things to it (aside from dividing) while that’s not the case with infinity. I think what OP was saying is that just how infinity is often defined to be simply “not finite” (i.e. larger than any real number), 0 can be defined to be simply “smaller (in magnitude) than any positive real number”. 

What I’m trying to get at is that, in math (specifically analysis), often when you want to prove that some quantity is equal to zero, you simply show that it’s smaller than every positive real number. The statements “a=b” and “for every positive real number, |a-b| is less than that number” are equivalent. Likewise, to show that something is infinite, you can simply show that it’s larger than any real number. For example, if you want to show that there are infinitely many natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), well, you know that 0 is a natural number, so there’s more than 0 natural numbers, and you know that 0+1=1 is a natural number, so there’s more than 1 natural number, and the same is true for every natural number, so there can’t be a natural number of natural numbers, and therefore there’s infinitely many of them."

"You know how a map of the world is smaller than the actual world?

Well that map has an infinity number of points that all match up with the infinite number of points on the actual world."
"Basically, when dealing with infinite sets you can't really count to determine ""how big they are"", because you'd never stop (and in some cases you can't count at all, but let's leave that aside for now). So how do you tell if two infinite sets have the same number of elements? You pair each element of one set with one element of the other set, and vice versa. If you can do this, they have the same ""number"" of elements. For elements in [0, 1] and [0, 2], this pairing consists of multiplying/dividing by 2. So the two sets have the same number of elements."
[vsause](https://youtu.be/SrU9YDoXE88) does a good job of it
Nothing is real and we all just pretend for sanity sake.
"We can make a map that starts with every number in (0,1) and ends up being mapped uniquely in every number in (0,2). Because we can construct it to take every number in (0,1) to a unique number in (0,2), we can go backwards. This means that they have the same ""size"""
"Every point in [0, 1] is paired to a unique point in [0, 2] and vice versa. This pairing means that these intervals must have the exact same number of elements, else an element would have been left out of the pairing."
"Because the lizard part of our brain likes information small enough to visualise. We like beginnings and ends. Just think small numbers, between 0-1 you have 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc, then 0.01... then 0.001... and continue forever. 0-2 also has all of those numbers that go forever, but also has the same pattern with 1.0, 1.1.... 1.01, 1.02.... truth be told, writing this out has helped me grasp this better, it is a weird math concept that is not easy to understand."
"So you have all the numbers between 0 and 1. Every single number between 0 and 1.


Take any number between 0 and 1 and double it and it will be between 0 and 2  because the lowest you can have is 2 x 0 = 0 and the highest is 2 x 1 = 1 and every number in between will fill all the infinitely small gaps in between.


It’s like this in more detail and less ELI3: 


take X where 0 < X < 1


Now double it, we have 2X where 2 x 0 < 2X < 2 x 1 



So 0 < 2X < 2


In math(s) we have to show that the set of all numbers between 0 and 1 has an injective map (one number goes to another one via some function) to show that they are the same size. 


The injective map we use in this case is the doubling function f where f: x —> 2x (This means the function f takes a number x and outputs 2x)


Now clearly, if we double a number, we are only ever going to get one other number from it, ie, I can’t double a number and get two different outcomes like you can if you square rooted a number like sqrt(9) = 3 or -3. The beauty of this is that it shows that for each and every number between 0 and 1, we have a corresponding unique number between 0 and 2, and since we have every single possible number between 0 and 1, then we double these to get every single number between 0 and 2


Since we now know that f(x) = 2x is one to one, then that suffices to say that there are the same amount of numbers in between 0 and 1 as there is between 0 and 2


We can also show this in the reverse way using the halving function g(x) = 0.5x"
Idk about his explanation but my ELI13 is infinity is a concept not a  number.
"That's true. You'd have to repeat [Cantor's Diagonal Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) to show that there are more real numbers in \[0,1\] than rationals in \[0,1\]. 

Oddly enough, there are more reals in \[0,1\] than rational numbers in \[0,2\]."
"Depends entirely on the definition of 'bigger' you're using.

This explanation uses the number of elements to show that they are of equal size. If your using a subset relation (0,1) is a real subset of (0,2) and thus smaller."
This is a really good analogy
"Why wouldn’t you just add a parallel line to represent all the additional numbers between 1 and 2?
Edit: this would double your size since you now have 2 lines, one representing all points between 0-1 and one representing all points between 1-2."
"Yeah sure, but there is still the same amount of numbers between 0 and 1, between 0 and 2 and between 1 and 2."
"> Don't you? For the sake of my sanity please tell me you do!

haha infinity go brrr"
"Yes, that's true. The points is that there *exists* a pairing. Sometimes it's trivial to find (like here with \[0,1\] -> \[0,2\]) and sometimes not (like Natural numbers -> Rational numbers)."
"You are focusing too much on the values we applied to these things. We created numbers and gave them values to make us understand everything in an abstract way. ""1"" could've easily been ""Tiddies"" and ""2"" could've easily been ""Uno"". You wouldn't think ""Well, Uno is more than tiddies so why are there not more hamburgelers between Resting-bitch-face and Uno?"".

Example:

You have a line of 2 cm. Now separate that line into 2 sections. You get two of those. Now separate those into two sections. Now you have 4 sections. Now keep separating the line into more and more sections. You can vary the size of those and you can theoretically keep separating that line into sections forever. You can go atomic, subatomic. It never stops. You can always go smaller and smaller. Infinte. There is no end to it. 

Now imagine a line of 1 cm. Now separate that line into 2 sections. You get two of those. Now separate those into two sections. Now you have 4 sections....

See any difference between the two? There isn't."
"Confusingly, there are more numbers between 0 and 1, then there are whole numbers (integers) between one and infinity, but that might be an explanation for another thread!"
"In fact, you can find a bijection between the rational numbers and the integers. (You just need to count in a zig-zag fashion).

The example you might be looking for is real vs. Rational numbers (with cantor's famous diagonalization argument)."
But you're using the subset relation as if those were finite sets. That doesn't prove anything.
"The issue is that you're then using a very bad definition for ""larger"", because then you're basically adding an additional rule that one set is ""larger"" than another if the latter is a subset of the former.

Which means if you have the simple case of [0,1] and [1,3], you can no longer apply that. Which furthermore means, the size of [0,2] is greater than [0,1], but the size of [0,1] and [1,3] would then be incomparable or equal, both cases which would be rather catastrophic. If you say they're incomparable, it's no longer defined over all set sizes (and in fact, the definition is useless in all non-trivial cases). If you say they're equal, we can then say because the size of [0,2] and [1,3] are also the same, [0,1] and [0,2] are necessarily the same size as well, contradicting the original premise.

You could also try to define ""larger"" based on the range on the number line. That however is also an incredibly narrow definition. Furthermore, you now can no longer compare sets of different sizes of infinities. For example, the set of rational points in a 2D square compared to the set of real points on a 1D length.

It is not necessarily that bijection shows that one is larger than the other. Rather, we define one set to be greater than or equal to another (in size) based on being able to produce a bijection, because that's the method which actually works and is useful and applicable in a general sense.

Edit: As can be seen in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality), it's not that finding the bijection *shows* that they are of equal size, rather equal size *is defined* as being able to find a bijection."
"> The bijection at best just shows they're both the same *type* of infinity in that they share that relation.

Your 'type of infinity' thing. Guess what? It's called cardinality.

---

Others have shown you why your notion of 'subsets have less elements' is inconsistent with the very definition of cardinality, so if you *were* to talk about cardinality as commonly defined, what you claimed to be 'very clear... therefore' is in fact a misconception.

Whether this cardinality thing is a good extension of the concept of number of elements of a finite size is probably philosophical. We know there are other stuff like measure that will work in other occasions, but here's an argument of why same number of elements should mean bijection:

Think of some abstract way in which unique elements of a set are laid out in front of you, and you want to know the number of elements there. One desirable property is that if for each element we give it a cloak so that its true identity is hidden, but any two cloaked elements remain distinguishable, the number should be the same

Now what is this cloak giving procedure? Turns out it's exactly a bijection between the elements and the masks you gave them. For example, if on one hand you have the crowd of real numbers in [0, 1], and in the other you have that of [0, 2], you can cloak 2x to cover each element x in [0, 2] to change its identity. Now your two crowds of elements are indistinguishable. We are pretty sure by now that the two crowds have equal number of elements now, so it must be the case.

This argument is delibrately not mathematical because as I mentioned the question of exactly what *is* number of elements is kinda a philosophical question, which doesn't really admit a mathematical proof, unless you define beforehand 'what *is* number of elements'"
More has no meaning in infinity
"It's fine to consider which sets are subsets of which, but then what happens if you try to compare the sizes of completely unrelated sets without using bijections? How would you compare the size of the set of real numbers in the interval [0,1] to, for example, the set of orientations in 3D space? It's just so useful in so many branches of math to say the number of points in a set doesn't increase if you apply a mapping. This isn't all that different from saying the open interval (0,1) and the closed interval [0,1] have the same length, despite the latter having more points."
But steel is heavier than feathers
" 50 bananas takes up less space than 50 elephants, but the sets are the same size"
pick any number between 0 and 1. multiply by 3. you now have a number between 0 and 3. divide by 3. you now have a number between 0 and 1. this is enough to prove that both intervals contain the same amount of elements
"You're showing that there are 'double' the numbers between 0 and 2, but since that kind of multiplication doesn't work with infinity it doesn't really matter.

All that matters to show that they are the same size is that you can find a one-to-one relationship between every number in [0,1] and [0,2]."
"A bijection is a 1 to 1 relationship.

If you have a set with a size you know and another set with a size you don't know you can show that they are the same size if you can find a one to one relationship between the elements in the sets.

Ten kids, unknown number of chairs. If every kid is sitting on a chair and no chair is left without a kid, how many chairs do you have?

Same thing works for infinite sets"
"It is relative. [0,1] and [0,2] are sizes that you attributed.   
   
All of a sudden, you could say that [0.1,0,2] is actually [1,2], and why wouldn't you be able to say that? the only thing attaching it would be to say what is a real unity, and for that we would have to either attach it to something on reality (a human = 1), or, merely decide that 1 is 1. But then, the moment you decide that 1 can be devided infinetly(0.1 or 0.0139231) then you are SAYING that there isn't a minimal value.   
   
Basically, the moment you understand/decide that something can be devided infinetly, you are saying that [0,1] and [0,2] are irrelevant to the conception of amount of minimal values inside of it.   
    
It's all based on deciding what is minimal value."
I like this explanation a lot.
It's also simpler than a mathematical proof that requires Set Theory to understand... (pairing numbers according to a binary operation)
"This is not even close to a good explanation, let alone ""best"". The sub is called r/explainlikeimfive, not r/explainlikeivehadtwoyearsofuniversityleveltrainingonthesubject"
Exactly. This is the difference between an explanation and simply giving the proof.
"You can divide 1 by 2 an infinite number of times, producing the the infinite set {1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, ...}

You can also divide 2 by 2 an infinite number of times, producing the infinite set {2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, ...}, which is the same as the other set, except it has one additional value.

Therefore the second set has infinity + 1 values

"No, cardinality always means number of elements. You probably got stuff mixed up."
"I'm no math expert but let me try.

Let's say we have two collections of objects. Let's do an exercise where we pick one object from collection A, pair it up with an object from collection B and set that unique pair aside so each object can only be paired up once.

At the end of the exercise, if collection A has no more objects, but collection B has leftovers, then we know collection B has more objects than A. However, if both collections empty at the same time, then we know they have the same number of objects. 

Now let's say collection A is all numbers from 0 to 1 and collection B is all numbers from 0 to 2.

So how do we create unique pairs now? Let's pair up numbers from A by selecting that number multiplied by 2 from B.

Here are some examples of pairs:

(Collection A, Collection B)
(1, 2)
(0.1111, 0.2222)
(0.35, 0.7)
(0.8912, 1.7824)
(etc, etc etc)


We know A has more numbers than B if there are leftovers numbers in A after we pair everything up. But you'll see that it's impossible to find ""leftover"" numbers from A because any number you can think of in A can be multiplied by 2 and be found in B. And not only that, but that number in B is unique, i.e. 0.2 in B can ONLY be paired with 0.1 in A because no other number can be multiplied by 2 to create 0.2. So we know A does NOT have more numbers than B.

We can also see the same vice versa. You can't find any leftover numbers in B because any number you can think of in B can be divided by 2 and you'll find a unique number in A to pair it with. Therefore, B does NOT have more numbers than A.

There is only one scenario where A is not bigger than B and B is not bigger than A, and that's when they are the same size. That is to say, both collections have an infinite number of unique pairs and no leftovers, and so are the same size."

"Infinity isnt an end goal, its a description of a set that cant be finished.

The set of integer numbers goes like {1,2,3,4,5....} and we definitely made progress there with those 5 numbers. We did count from 1 to 5. You can go to 6 and beyond though. Its an infinite set, but its a **countable** infinity. The set of whole numbers is similar but it extends out in both directions {...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...}. You might say this is bigger than the other one but it isnt. Its still a countable infinity, making the two the same size.

An **uncountable** infinity is one you cant make progress in. See, the set of all real numbers. We cant make a single step on this set. Start at 0, and then... 0.1? No, because theres 0.01, or 0.001, or 0.0001... and in between all of those is also an infinite amount of numbers. We cant even find the second number, making it uncountable. This set actually is larger than the countable infinite sets."
"Might not be the best explanation but the gist of it is that there are 2 kinds of infinities. The ones you can count and those that are uncountable.
Whole numbers are a countable infinity cause you can count 1,2,3... even though you will never finish an than there are all numbers which you can't count cause 1,2, you left out 1,5 so 1, 1,5 ,2, you left out 1,25 and so on ..."
"Here's an even easier version.

Let's start with the easy case, of a finite set. For example, [0;0.2;0.4;0.6;0.8;1]. If we stretch it to span [0,2], we get [0;0.4;0.8;1.2;1.6;2].

In particular, what is important to note here, is that you can transform the members of a set however you like without changing its size (as long as each member remains unique). In this case, we multiplied each number by two.

This applies even to infinitely large sets, such as all real numbers in [0,1]. In particular, if we multiply all numbers in it by two, we know the size of the set has not changed. Yet, as OP mentioned, we also can see that this new set is identical to the set of numbers in [0,2]. Therefore, the two sets must be the same size as we never changed it in our operation."
"Nope, because the new number is different from every number on the list in at least one place. Even if, say, the 501st number matched your number exactly, when you reached row 501 you would change the 501st digit to something else, and it would no longer match."

"You have a hotel with infinite rooms. They're all occupied. Then one new guest arrives. What do you do?

Easy, you tell every guest to move up one room. Now there are still infinite occupied rooms, but room 1 is empty. Now the guest can move in, and you once again have infinite occupied rooms, like in the beginning."
"The best advice I've got is to realise that infinity is a concept, not a real numerical value. In math if we can define a bijective function from one set of numbers to another, we can say that both sets of numbers are the same size. A bijective function requires that it be one-to-one, as in every unique input has a unique output, and onto, which means every element in the range of the function has an element in the domain that maps to it. 


So an example would be the function f(x)=2x


In this function we have if f(x)=f(y), then 2x=2y, and thus x=y. Similarly we can look at the inverse function, f^-1(x)=x÷2, and see that for any element in the range, we can get it by plugging half of its value as the domain.


Essentially, they both have an uncountably large set of numbers, so we must rely on basic math definitions to help us."
"No because there is an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 1 and an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 2, so what you’re doing is trying to find the total first, which you won’t be able to even get close to, and then you die, and for generations after you people will devote themselves to count but will never make it to the 1 because the numbers are infinite, the 1.5 never really gets “added”, because you never are done with the numbers between the 0 and 1 for you to simply “move on” to the 0 and 2 and add 1.5 to the total, infinity is simply infinite, there’s no “but 1.5 is in the infinity of 0 to 2 but not in the 0 to 1” since you never reach the end of 0 to 1 in the first place

0 to 1 and 0 to 2 is simply an interval but they both contain as many numbers, which is an infinite amount of numbers, the numbers just never stop popping up so the comparison isn’t possible."
"Stop thinking of infinite as a number you can count, it’s not a number, it’s a concept. You cannot count the total number of numbers between 0 and 1, because that will be infinite.   
Infinite is a word, a word used to describe a situation where there isn’t a limited number of things, you’ll be counting forever with no end.   

For example, 1/3 will equal 0.33333*, the 3 will go on infinitely, as in there is no limit, there is no final 3 to find. In that sense, there’s just as many 3’s in a 0.3333* recurring as there are numbers between 0 and 1, both equal the word infinite."
"The important part is that for each number that is between 1 and 2, you can find a corresponding number that is between 0 and 1.

1.1 has a corresponding number being 0.55.
The relation between the intervals 0-1 and 0-2 is fairly ""easy"" (divide or multiply by 2), making you forget that you are actually corresponding each number with a partner.

If you're really interested, you could try and understand why there are as many fractions (e.g. 1/2, 3/4) as there are whole positive numbers (e.g. 0,1,2). But there are more decimal numbers (e.g. 0.153, 4.674, 9.3333...) than there are whole numbers.

This proof is called Cantor's diagonal argument and it is a very fundamental proof in regarding infinities.

Edit/PS; 
An easier proof is to show that there are as many positive whole numbers (0,1,2,...) as there are whole numbers (...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...). There are many correspondences you can find, but the easiest one would be;

0 corresponds to 0

1 corresponds to 1

-1 corresponds to 2

2 corresponds to 3

-2 corresponds to 4

3 corresponds to 5

-3 corresponds to 6

...

and in short;

x corresponds to (2*x - 1) if x is positive.

x corresponds to 2*(-x) if x is negative."

"I'm having trouble wrapping my head around that. If I had a pound of dough, and kept dividing the dough into smaller pieces, out to infinite pieces, I'd have infinite pieces of one pound of dough. Each subsequent division makes the pieces smaller, the overall mass doesn't change. Bring 'em all back together, and there's a pound of dough.   


Two pounds of dough, will also give infinite pieces, so the number out to infinity will be the same, but you have two pounds of dough."

"Zero is a bit of a slippery character, though.  It looks like a number, and a lot of things that you can do with other numbers you can also do with zero.  The same can be said of infinity.  But there are certain things you can do with other numbers that if you try to do them with zero don't work, like division.  We think of zero as nice and infinity as not nice because zero has a very small, well defined place on the number line between positive and negative real numbers, and it feels like it should fit neatly with the rest.  The reality, though, is that zero is like a little tiny hole in the number line where if you aren't careful things blow up or slip through or do odd and unexpected things.  Taking advantage of this character lets us to all kinds of useful stuff like calculus, but it's the sort of thing that if you try to think too hard about it will give you a headache.  Easiest just to pretend it's just another number like all the others."

"I'm not sure if I get your point. But if you mean just a number line, the line from 0-2 would be twice as long as the line from 0-1. The infinities wouldn't be different, but it wouldn't help visualizing tht they are the same imo."
"Infinite sizes don't quite behave like finite sizes, consider this example of Hilbert's Hotel.

Imagine you have a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, numbered with every whole number above 0. So, we have rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on indefintely. Imagine I came with one extra guest I wanted to fit, my hotel is full though right? Wrong, send each guest in some room n to some room n+1. Every guest in a room n will be able to go to a room n+1, and we know there will only be one person in each room because n+1=m only has one solution in the whole numbers (you can never have something like 135+1=212+1). Then, there are no guests in room 1 (because each n+1=0 has no solution when restricted to whole numbers greater than 1). So adding one doesn't increase the size, and by doing this backwards you can check that taking one doesn't decrease the size either.

Consider then if we had as many guest as whole numbers greater than 0 come to try and stay when our hotel was already full. Can we fit them all? Actually, yes! Multiply the room number n that a guest in the hotel is already in by 2, and send each guest to that room. The guest at 1 goes to 2, the guest at 2 goes to 4, 3 goes to 6, and so on. Then each guest who was already here is in room 2, 4, 6, 8, etc, and we only have 1 guest in each room (because 2n=only has one solution in whole numbers, you can never have 2 times one whole number equal 2 times another whole number). Now, all our original guests are in even numbered rooms, and all of our odd numbered rooms are empty. Put the first new guest in room 1, the second new guest in room 3, the third in room 5, etc. Formally, if each new guest corresponds to a whole number m>0 you can associated with an odd whole number 2m-1. So, if you have two copies of the whole numbers, this actually the same ""size"" as one copy.

So, the hotel example we've been discussing is talking about discrete points and not the real numbers, but hopefully this example of 2 times something being the same size as the original something in this case gives a sense of the foavor of why the real numbers from 0 to 1 and 0 to 2 have the same size.

The rub you are coming against is that there are two different ideas of size at play here. Your geometric idea of size is one thing, which has to do with the particular way we lay out the points, but what we're talking about here is a different notion of size based on the number of points and the possibility of one to one correspondance which is the fundamental basis of the notion of the size of sets. The set of all points in a line is not the same as a line, in a set order doesn't matter for example. These notions of size are related tbf, measure theory studies and shows how the one relates to the other, but they're not the same. If that sounds weird, consider area and length. Both of those are a sort of size, right? But area is fundamentally a different sort of size than length still, even though they are related they are not the same functionally in a geometric sense. The size of a set is similar, we're inherently treating the line not as a geometric object with some structure but rather a set with a collection of points. You could consider this a weaker form of equivalence in some ways I suppose, in the same way that any shape without a hole is the same topologically because topology doesn't preserve all the geometric qualities of an object."

"Think of definitions of an even number and zero will follow them.

An even number is a number than can be divided by two without any residual. Zero divided by two is zero with no residual. Even number.

Or, put another way, an even number is a multiple of two. Zero times two is zero. Even number.

Or, an even number is between two odd numbers (integers). On either side of zero is -1 and +1, both odd numbers. Therefore, zero is even.

Or, add two even numbers and you'll get an even number. Add zero with any even number and you'll get an even number.

It doesn't matter how infinitesimally small your pin is or where you move it to, there's still another point on the globe that matches up."
"> unless the 'points' are also infinitely small

"Yes, by pairing I mean taking one element from [0, 1] and one from [0, 2] and thinking of them as a pair. You could visualise it like this: if you keep creating pairs like this, at the very end you would have used up all elements from both [0, 1] and [0, 2]. That must mean they have the same number of elements. If one would have more elements, those elements would have been left unpaired."
The question in itself is wrong. There aren't more numbers in the larger interval
Everything in this thread made absolutely no sense until I read this. Thank you so much.
"Honestly, the problem with questions like ""Why is [0,1] the same size as [0,2]?"" is that the asker doesn't really know what they're asking; that is, they don't know what ""the same size"" really means.

Comparing sizes is very intuitive between finite sets - you count the elements in one, then the other, then compare the two numbers. Piece of cake. The problem is, you can't do that with infinite sets. How would you count them?

So, mathematicians came up with a pretty neat general definition: *two sets have the same magnitude (""size"") iff you can find a 1:1 mapping between those sets.* This definition seems like it does what you'd expect, and it is consistent with how we compare sizes on finite sets. It is also an equivalence relation, which is what you want for a thing like this. It's all around a great way to compare any two sets.

But it produces some results we wouldn't expect, since our brains aren't equipped to handle infinities intuitively. For example, natural numbers have the same magnitude as integers, which have a same magnitude as rational numbers. This seems odd, if you think about the ""traditional"" way to think about set sizes, since one is a subset of the other, but it's a result of our definition.

The way to not get lost in this is to abandon your preconceptions about sizes. When asking questions such as ""is [0,1] the same size as [0,2]?"" throw away your natural understanding of what ""size"" means. It can't help you here. Instead, rely on the definition. Then, your question becomes much more well-defined as ""do the sets [0,1] and [0,2] have the same magnitude?"" which we now know how to answer. 

Can you find a 1:1 mapping between [0,1] and [0,2]? Yes. Therefore, the sets have the same magnitude. Since that was the question we were actually asking in the first place - even if we didn't know it - this is the correct answer, regardless of how ""unintuitive"" it may be."
The Fourier series allows for any function over a closed interval to be represented by countably infinite Fourier coefficients. That might be satisfactory.
The diagonalization argument works for real numbers essentially because reals have infinite decimal places at which they can differ. This is not so for integers; every integer has a fixed number of digits.
"You don't actually need to prove the natural numbers are countable - it's trivial because countability is defined by the existence of an injection to the natural numbers (f(x) = x, done). But, yes, it would be problematic if you could use the diagonal argument to prove they were uncountable.

So I think the key to understanding is, as the other guy says, that reals can only be represented by an infinite sequence of digits, whereas naturals are each a finite sequence. We can choose N and diagonalise all the naturals representable by N digits:

    0
    1

Diagonal is 0, Cantor's number is 1, which is obviously in the set.

    0 0
    1 0
    1 1

Diagonal is 00, Cantor's number is 11, which is obviously in the set.

    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    0 1 0
    1 1 0
    0 0 1
    1 0 1

Diagonal is 000, Cantor's number is 111, which is obviously in the set.

It's apparent pretty quickly that no matter how big we make N, diagonalisation won't construct a number outside the set. And because the natural numbers are so well behaved, we might be able to take this behaviour to the limit and say it works for infinite N. Although I'm too rusty to be sure.

Try and take this approach with the reals and it won't work."

">> Which furthermore means, the size of [0,2] is greater than [0,1], but the size of [0,1] and [1,3] would then be incomparable or equal
>
>I'm not understanding why this is the case

The proposed rule is that if set A is a subset of set B, then B must be a larger set.

The above poster pointed out that the proposed rule can't analyze whether or not [0, 1] or [1, 3] were larger, as neither set is the subset of the other. The two would either be considered ""incomporable"" since the rule doesnt apply, or ""equal""  since neither set is larger than the other."

"I disagree. ELI5, while although is never at a 5 year old level as most concepts would be lost on a five year old, should always be explained in a very basic way.

For someone that has studied math, maybe you're right. But I think you're grossly overestimating the amount of people that have studied to that level - and possibly those that have studied to that level and have a good grasp of what is being taught."
"The point that went missing in this analogy is that there only has to exist a bijection, every pair doesn’t have to be one. 

You can see this by as an example letting both the sets A and B be the reals between 0 and 1. If we take every element in A and pair it with an element in B with half its value as we did before, we find that elements more than 0.5 in A have no pair. Obviously this is wrong as we said at the beginning that both of the sets were the same and so contained exactly the same elements.

In order to prove that two sets are the same size you just need to find a bijection (i.e. a one to one pairing from A to B), but to prove that one is larger you need to prove that regardless of how you pair them up, you will always have something left over in one of the sets."
Two sets are the same size of there is *a* 1-1 mapping between them. There is no requirement that all mapping are 1-1.
"I felt the exact opposite, which is interesting because she obviously got through to a lot of people.

To me this was a very distracting method of explaining these complex ideas. The way she kept doodling the stick figures tore me away from the concepts she was laying out and I was not able to follow along without rewinding.


This just goes to show how people learn differently. 

I'm sure some people might find the subject too boring and would need something that is colorful and fun like this to keep them engaged, but then other people like me have an easier go of it if it was just in black and white and not so ADDish, so as not to get distracted, which is kind of ironic I guess."

"But if there are an infinite number of rooms that are occupied, wouldn't it be impossible for the people to go to a higher numbered room because those higher numbered rooms are already occupied?"
"that's the point- they are all occupied, as there is an infinite amount of people there, and an infinite amount of rooms. however, at the same time, there is still more rooms as there is endless rooms."

"This only really works as a thought experiment because Planck’s length defines the shortest possible distance between 2 objects without touching, meaning that no distance measured irl has infinite divisions."
"I think Planck length says this bidirectional mapping wouldn't work, because a globe has obviously less distinct points."
"It's important to clarify these are imaginary points, since at a certain level of accuracy in the real world means that you're talking about the width of one atom of paper on the map that encompasses several million atoms of real space in the equivalent area on the actual globe.

In imaginary numerical planes where it's pure math, we accept *by postulate* (on faith for sake of argument) that a point has no width, only a numerical location. When we start talking about real world stuff that's where geometry and physics come in, but in pure math we want to eliminate all the real world messiness and pretend that a 1"" cube of cake can actually be divided into 100 precisely equal parts."

"Say you're in room 2.

The dude from room 1 just got displaced by a bus person. You now have to go to 4.

The guy in 4 just has to go to 8. And so on.

Story mode:

Bus person 1 (Hereafter bus people are Bus1, bus2 etc) comes in

He goes to room 1, and tells that person to go to room 2, and to repeat the instructions recursively that each person who's door gets knocked on has to go to room (number x 2).

Bus2 comes in. He needs to go to 3 (2nd person = 2, x2 = 4, -1 = odd number 3). He tells that person the same instructions.

Bus 3 goes 3x2 = 6, -1 = 5. Tells the person in 5 to follow those instructions..

Every person from the bus displaces 1 person. Every person displaced displaces 1 person.

You can pick any nth person from the bus, and I can tell you exactly what will happen for them to get a room.

EG:

71527 gets off the bus. He has to go to room 71527 x 2 - 1 = 143,053. He tells that person to go to 143,053 x 2 = 246,106. 

The person in 246,106 has to go to 492,212 (his room doubled) and so on.

Everyone has a place. Because both the hotel and the bus are *countably* infinite."
"The example said ""all rooms are occupied"". So there is no free room for any one guest to move to. 

My point is that the idea of ""an infinite number"" of physical objects is no help to someone attempting to understand infinity in the first place. Just doesn't help."
Believe in the infinity that believes in you!
Because it doesn't exist...it is odd.
"""Another"" meaning 2 and another. But 4 is even, even though it's 2 times itself. But if we're going to get hung up on semantics, an integer x is even if x can be expressed as 2*Z where Z is an integer and * denotes multiplication."

Another fun fact that blew my mind in my first Probability class was this :

Suppose I'm thinking about a real number between 0 and 1. What is the probability that you'll correctly guess the number ?

By the definition of classical probability, it's zero - meaning it's (theoretically) impossible  for you to guess my number correctly. You can really do a lot of fun things with infinitesimality.

E: as u/Mordy3 pointed out, the impossibility is theoretical, because following this logic you can deduct that the probability of choosing any point from this interval is 0 and since you are choosing one of them, an 'impossible' event is surely going to happen."
"Hm, that's an interesting application of the Banach fixed point theorem."
Neat
"Does that really make the idea of connected sets a thought experiment though? As a disclaimer I was a math major and not a physics major but that never really made sense to me and it is an argument I've heard before. Sure, you can never have two objects that are 1/2 of a Planck length apart, but that doesn't mean that the distance itself doesn't exist, since it's still possible to talk coherently about e.g. two objects that move from 1 to 3/2 of a planck length apart. At which point you'd have a notion of one particle moving a distance of 1/2 of a Planck length (if the other one was held fixed). Have I missed something about the physics?"
"We're talking math not physics :P

But in theory and/or practice, you're not wrong."
"The Planck length only really applies if you want to do physics with it. It's not some magic point at which numbers break down; there's nothing to say you can't have (theoretical) divisions of the Planck length when you're doing things like coordinates, which is what we're talking about here.

We're very much in the theoretical when it comes to things like infinite divisions of space."
"In the physical world, you're right. But in that same world, there *isn't* an infinite amount of values between 0 and 1 either. There exists all sorts of numbers between 0 and 1 that are impossible for anyone to write down. Almost all numbers between 0 and 1 cannot be expressed in this universe."
We're in mathland so no
"Space isn't quantized in such a way. Planck length is just the distance at which our understanding of physics starts to break down. There is  always a point in space between two distinct points, even if the distance between those points is shorter than the Planck length."
"I find it weird to call points imaginary points as if to distinguish them from... what exactly? I don't know of a point concept that has a volume, even in the ""real world"""
"You make a very good point (I just wanted to avoid additional complexity).

It's not really quite right to talk about ‘number’ here – the formal phrasing would be that the sets of points have the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality)."
Your username is what this thread is doing to me.
Hopefully it's an infinitely tiny stab wound so it doesn't bleed too much.
numbers go brrr
There's the same amount between 0 and 1 as there are between 0 and 2. Why? Because I said so.

"I'm gonna try, you let me know if I'm too baked (it's my bday and I got rained outta work so I'm stoked for the day off and got a little over zealous with the botanicals).

[0,1] [0,2]

Both ranges have an infinite number of points between them. The definition of the range limits the space those infinite amount of points can occupy.

So the ranges of [0,1] and [0,2] equally contain an infinite number of points, while confined to different lengths."
"Yes, but room 8 was already occupied. So was room 16. And 32. And 64. And so on, all the way down. All of them are already occupied."
Not all abstract concepts have practical world analogs.  You're just going to have to accept that.
"You’d have Lupus, sir."

">Suppose I'm thinking about a real number between 0 and 1. What is the probability that you'll correctly guess the number ?

Oh i know that one, its 50%! You either guess right or you guess wrong."
"My favourite is a particular branching process we got given for an assignment.

Firstly, define a branching process as one with generations. Each generation, roll a die (/sample from a distribution), and whatever number comes up is how many branches there are for that generation. At the next generation, roll the die again for each branch, and whatever number comes up is the new number of branches that come from that branch.

You can think of it like tracing family names (assuming women take the man's name, and everyone's hetero). Let's say you have 5 sons who all get married and have kids - that would be you rolling a 5. However many sons they have is whatever they roll from their die.

Anyway, if you define a branching process with sampling distribution of Binomial (3,p) [I think... The actual distribution escapes me], the probability of the branching process dying out (or no sons being born) is 1. The expected time to death, though, is infinite.

Like, imagine knowing that you'll die, but it'll only happen after forever. Are you really going to die? How does that even work?

Kinda complicated and hard to explain, but yeah, this one stuck with me"
">E: as u/Mordy3 pointed out, the impossibility is theoretical, because following this logic you can deduct that the probability of choosing any point from this interval is 0 and since you are choosing one of them, an 'impossible' event is surely going to happen.

You are still not quite correct. There is no impossibility, even in theory. The theory has a [special concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) defined for cases like this. It's a possible event, whose probability is 0, which is an entirely different beast from an impossible event (whose probability is also 0, but that's all they have in common; the probability of 0 is not synonymous with impossibility when dealing with infinite sets!)"
"In reality though, the number of numbers which you are capable of choosing is a tiny fraction of the numbers between 0 and 1. So that’s theoretically true but not in any practical sense."
"Slight correction: it is theoretically impossible for me to guess a random number between 0-1, but it's not theoretically impossible for me to guess a number that you've thought up due to the biases of your human mind"
"It's not so much about points having a volume, as it is the idea that the Planck Length is the smallest possible measurement of distance.

If we're talking real world, it doesn't make sense to define a point more accurately than a Planck Length. Mathematically speaking, there are still an infinity of points within that space."

"Sorry, I don't get this one. Can you elaborate?"
"But how would it die out? You can't roll 0 on a dice, so at least 1 son will be born each generation. Am I missing something?"
"That doesn't quite work. You need to have \*some\* chance of generating zero branches for any node otherwise it's guaranteed to never die out.

If you're rolling dice then you've got a min value of 1, so you're guaranteed that every node has at least one branch, and thus it goes on forever. Make it *d6-1* instead and it's right though, and it's right for any other sampling process that has zero as a valid result."
I don't understand. How the branching dies out? Even if you got 1 you got one son and the family continues...
"True, far more people are going to pick 0.7 than 0.84672181342151243553467513727648265394646151352491846865845482"
"In reality, continuity doesn't work at all. If you define a smallest possible timeframe or a smallest possible distance, eg. the Planck units, you end up in a discrete system. Much like I'm not able to write down nor think of all the irrational numbers in this interval."

The power of infinity.
"On an infinite time line where the universe collapses and reforms itself an infinite number of times, all possibilities would happen, an infinite number of times."
"The probability that you draw any given number in the interval \[0,1\] is 0 since all choices are equally as likely and there are infinitely many from which to choose. Another way to think of it is in terms of total probability. If we say that any point has non-zero probability of being drawn and they all share this probability, then summing over all events will give a probability greater than 1!"
"The distribution used in the case where it dies out is a binomial distribution, which can have outcome zero. More generally, I would think that any distribution with zero as a possible outcome (you could also take a dice numbered 0-5 for example) will give a branching process that eventually dies out."
That's what I thought too
"Dammit, how'd you guess my number?! I knew I should've gone with 0.84672181342151243553467513727648265394646151352491846865845483 instead"
"It's worse. The limited energy contained in the universe means that there are numbers that you can't pick, because you'd run out before you were able to precisely describe it."
"Well, it's one thing to talk about real numbers as a concept, and quite another to talk about whether real numbers *are actually real*, or if physics is just discrete if you look close enough.

Note also that you still can't choose just *any* real number anyway. You need to be able to describe it, in other words, your brain must be able to compute it. For all infinite numbers, you can't do that by writing just digits. For rational periodic numbers, you can think of a fraction, like 1/3. For some irrational numbers, you can think of them as the n-th root of something else, like sqrt(2), or the solution to some equation, and so on. But there are posited to be real numbers that are outright *incomputable* - no finite algorithm can compute and describe them. So not only you can't write them out in full, you can't even have a proper way to *think* of any of them specifically. And these Yog-Sothoth of numerals, unknowable to human mind or any of our machines, burrow deep, in infinite amounts, nested deep even within such a small, familiar interval as ""from 0 to 1""."
"Can you explain what a discreet system is in this context please?

I'm also wondering how you could have infinite points on a map as it relates to the Planck length.

Wouldn't that dictate how small a point could be made on the map and therefore mean that the number of points isn't infinite after all?"

However, it looks far from real world. For example, lighting in the shot looks off. I can't really admire photos like this because I think it takes away the challenge from the photography. With the level of your post-production skills, I feel like you can create a similar photo when your are given a bad shot (wrong exposure, lighting, etc.). Then, the name of this subreddit should be IEditedAPicture rather than ITookAPicture.

I think this is the reason why the most awarded photos have little to none crazy edits on them. (They do some adjustments nevertheless). And this is also why people invest in high quality gear.

If the aim here is to come up with most beautifully arrenged pixels in the world (this is usually what you want to create if you are selling the photo), I have no complaints at all.

All in all this is a personal opinion. I think this should be discussed more. I want to hear what you think on this matter, also."

"Worked as a professional photographer for ~10 years, here's my input. 

Editing photos is *part of* taking a photograph, not really something separate. Even back in the film days we would dodge and burn or use a multitude of tricks to ""edit"" analog photos years before anyone ever dreamed of photoshop or digital photography. 

A lot of professional photographers shoot in a format called RAW, the best way to think of this type of file is it's taking the same photo with every different setting possible on your camera (with some limits of course). You can then go back in post process-ing and tweak or modify colors, shadows, gradients, etc. that you would have been able to modify at the moment you took the photo, but instead you're doing it in post. The files a huge relative to the more standard JPEG files, but the flexibility they allow in post processing is incredible. 

I hope that makes somewhat sense. My experience was always that editing photos is a part of taking them, not an optional or separate endeavor."
Absolutely. He should take a look!
I'm guessing it's an HDR photo. Notice how the lights aren't overexposed and drowning out the rest of the detail

"Yeah but calling it “digital art” would be incorrect. Cuz that would be composite photography. This seems to be one frame and normal editing has been done.

Would you call ansel Adams’ work “digital art” would you consider [this picture of James Dean “digital art”](https://vintagenewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1.bp_.blogspot.comjames-dean-times-square-1-308f0b47e10cedaf05755c3305b6a889632fc32a.jpg)? Well, not digital art, but they’re edited like crazy. The amount of dodging and burning on film photos is insane."
"I agree that it’s edited a lot, but think it’s done well (at least for this style) and really adds to the subject matter. 

Art is art. If all the lights had been composited in, I’d have a problem with it.

Genie: Rapes me...
"Why do y’all care so much about sex? Once you’ve had it you are the same person. I’d say getting someone that loves you is much much better, as that genuinely changes you. But that’s just my opinion."
"I mean technically there’s no guarantee that you’ll remain a virgin based on the wording of that wish.  The only thing the wish did is guarantee you don’t die, not guarantee that you’re a virgin forever. So, I see this as an absolute win!"
I am already immortal
Why did you post this on r/holup . It doesn’t really belong there
"This is too secret info for all that summon a genie- say ""I wish for me to become omnipotent without any harm to my physical and mental state"""
it be like that
And when you do the secks you die
It's a win win situation for me
"sometimes, you have to take matters into your own hands."
At that point moght aswell rape someone but will you die after that?
I'm just wondering but why being virgin is like a bogeyman for you?
So if you wish you don't want to live forever will it conflict with the first wish?
Damn he has become an Highlander
Nice
This was on monkeys paw too
Be good with your trusty hand
If you have already had sex does this make you immortal?
"Actually, asking to not die a virgin is better than just asking for straight up sex. It’s much more fun that way"

"If you put a , after die the genie is a virgin"
Well at last you have to take the help of your wallet.

"Guys i dont post much, but i cant post to this community. : //"
"Won't u die the next stunt then? Since I think he's no longer a virgin, he loses the immortality"
"Nah nah. He made you immortal, not invulnerable. You can be dismembered and still be alive. You could be nothing but a head on a pike on the walls of London tower shit talking the true immortal Queen Elizabeth II. But you won’t be able to fuck, and you’ll have to live like that until someone decides to give you a robo body I guess"
After the first stunt you’d be a paralyzed immortal.
He's immortal not indestructible. He'll be paralysed forever

Comment
"In the first season of afterlife there was a conversation like that. 

Ricky Gervais' character gets asked by a religious co-worker what stops him from doing bad things if it isn't god. It goes on a bit then he says something like

""I've killed all the people I've ever wanted to"" (co worker looks shocked) ""zero, I've killed zero people"" 

And she just doesn't comprehend."
"This reminds me of how older people In families remark on the younger ones appearances like “if I were # years younger...” and how sometimes that it’s pedophilia/borderline pedophilia.

Aunt Helen, you are CLEARLY stating that you find little Jimmy attractive, and that because you are old that you won’t do anything. It’s still concerning."
"Theres a line in the bible that says ""'They do what i ask but there hearts are not in the right place', or something like that.  God listens to our hearts an it sounds like your mother missed that. I absolutely hate when people use religion for dumb shit when the message is good."
"Real Christians are not Christians because they are better than other people.  They are Christians because they have problems that they know they can't fix, and they believe that God can fix those problems.

 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, ""It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."" 

\--Mark 2:17 (NIV)

Many people use Christianity as some sort of Sunday Club, but that wasn't what Jesus was going for."
"I'd like to maybe add a different perspective on this. I agree that religion should not be the entire reason that you don't awful shit. But religious texts and their principles remain the same throughout the ages, which create a sense of consistency through time.

Slavery as we know it today is absolutely wrong. Yet back in the 1800s any white man who owned a slave wouldn't have been considered doing anything morally wrong, because it was an accepted practice in society. Now we agree that keeping slaves is morally wrong, because current morals say that all men are equal.

Being gay or lesbian is also increasingly accepted now by normal standards, yet just in the last century it was considered morally wrong to have same sex attractions. What was once considered immoral has now changed into something that is accepted by society.

My point is that morals are relative. Who is to say that the actions we commit now won't be considered immoral in the future? Would that make you an immoral person?

While I might not agree with everything that religious texts advocate, at least the message they preach remains consistent.

Just my two cents :)"
"The thing is that religious people base their morale compass on what their scripture says and what they hear through prayer. When you remove that basis there is no structure for moral code left. Atheists are different because they have to build a moral code on what they personally feel is right or wrong. It's like an atheist saying ""if killing this guy wasn't wrong, then I would so do it"".

And most religious people know why you shouldn't do bad things, most will agree with me in saying it isn't out of fear of punishment either."
This isn't unpopular at all.
Not unpopular.
"Tbh that’s a really good point. I fully respect people that have a religion as a way of coping. I met an ex army vet with serve PTSD, he managed to beat his raging heroin addiction, and every other addiction to drugs. He tried to kill himself 5 times once he jumped off a bridge, downed a bottle of JD and loads of Xanax, stopped his dad from blowing his head off with a shotgun, he saw all of his mates die in the Northern Ireland troubles. His wife cheated on him with his mate years later. The only way he doesn’t kill himself is because he believes that devoting his life to god (Jehovah) is the only answer.

And then I’ve met people that say shit like *If I wasn’t religious I would’ve been a school shooter* like what the fuck? Exactly the reason why I hate religion and I’m not religious but I’m agnostic. I grew up a JW but I realised how abusive the whole thing is and left. 

If you’re religious just make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons and not shit like *id be a terrorist if not for my religion or someshit like that*."
"Word.
This reminds me of an argument i had last week with a friend who thinks that the fear of punishment is what pushes us to do good .. (?????what)

If you need to fear something to do good means you're horrible... Imo"
"If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward, then brother that person is a piece of shit.
                              

- Rust Cohle, True detective season 1"
"I'm a Christian, and I agree. I follow morals set by Jesus but this doesn't mean I'm constantly having to look in my Bible to see what the right thing to do is. If you're a good person you should just know what the right thing to do is without having to reference a source, religious or otherwise."
"""You should be a good person based on your own moral code""
Religion is a lot of people's own moral code, the difference is insignificant ."
Popular opinion. I've read this many times before.
"I was raised Christian, but in the last few months I realized it's just not something I believe in. I realized now there's a lot more I'm open to. Now it's not anything like murder, but I've just been trying to figure myself out now. Things like swearing and not being straight are suddenly an option. I'm still pretty young, but I've realized that in college or beyond I could make a few bucks with sex work or other things like that. Also things like getting drunk or high.

Tl;dr there was a lot that morally I'm fine with, but the religion I was raised in would be against it"
"See this is while I’m always confused when people ask me how I know right from wrong without the Bible. Like, do you really need a book to tell you not to do bad things?"
"Religion always reminded me of Santa's for children. ""Be good and you get rewarded, be bad and you get punished"". Like no, just be good, if you need someone to tell you to be good you're probably a bad person in the first place"
This is the same with the law. I thought it was common sense.
"Completely agree. 

It's the same thing with parenting. I'm not a parent, myself, but i just don't like it when parents say ""Don't do this or else you'll go to hell"" or ""the police will take you to prison"". I mean, it's good that you tell your kids to not do certain things to keep them from harm or forming bad habits but you should make them understand why it's wrong, why they shouldn't do a certain thing. It would help them in developing their morality as they grow up."
"Idk, the world is crazy enough as it is – essentially, we all long for something to believe in. So I think as long as religion makes a person do good deeds, then it serves its purpose. That’s pretty much it."
"I think you have a point. I lived a very religious life for 35 years (some would call it a cult). When I left/escaped from that I found that many of the teachings that I held to be true, were in fact, wrong. I use this as an example to support you in the reason for religion being the reason ""why"" you do things. A person should definitely know the reasoning behind a believe and know wither they believe and support it or not. I chose to leave, because I eventually came to the realization that God cannot be both all loving, but also hate those that the leaders of my church said we should hate. It can't be both. 

Your mother just doesn't seem to have come to the realization that the things she says likely contradict what her personal moral code is. It is sometimes the case that religion can be a crutch that limits our development as human beings. I mentioned how long I was in a cult for the example as well, so that you can see that we can persist for a very long time before we realize things. Be kind to your mother... she likely doesn't know better."
"Religion was created to deter people from doing bad things by scaring them. Therefore it's less of a fault of the individual for being terrified of the implied ""truth"" of religion and more a fault of the religion itself for being scared of everyone else"
"So then the reverse statement to this must also be true. If you're a horrible person by nature and need religion to stop you from doing horrible things, then religion is a wonderful thing."
"""Religion is the husk of faith""

Lao Tzu

Tao Te Ching"
Religion is where you get objective morality from.
"For me, I believe that religion is supposed to guide you. The Bible is to be perceived as simple guidance, not “How to Not Burn in Hell: for Sinners”.
But, if God is there to GUIDE you... That doesn’t mean he’s there to tell you not to kill somebody. He’s there to guide you from not even wanting to kill somebody at all. 
This is just my views on religion. But I don’t believe people shouldn’t do things just because God doesn’t want them to. You shouldn’t do it because YOU don’t want to."
"Can I get an ""Amen"" for this guy?"
"I'm with you, bud"
"""If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward then, brother, that person is a piece of s***"""
I'd say this is a very popular opinion. I'm religious and agree with you.
"""If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.""

-Albert Einstein (yes he actually said this one)"
"As good ol' Kant would say, you're not a morally good person if you just act like one because of your fear of being punished."
Yea 9/10 if you meet a “born again Christian “ they’re incredibly shitty people who have done incredibly shitty things and now want everyone to see them as religious so they think they changed. And some do but the point is if you have to dedicate yourself to a religion just to not be a shitty person then odds are you’re just a naturally shitty person.
Any subjective worldview with a subjective code of morality attached to it is by definition a religion. Leftism (or as I like to call it—Evangelical Humanism) is a non-theistic religion.
"I’ve grown up in a religious household all my life and I think there is some more nuance to this. Religious people don’t need religion to keep them moral per se, I find religious people need religion to hold their worldview together. Religion is often a lens for people to make sense of a very confusing world. It’s not that they are terrible people and would do terrible things without the fear of hell instilled in them, it’s that without religion their whole worldview would fall apart and they’d effectively have to rebuild from the ground up. They wouldn’t suddenly become amoral and do everything that religion had been holding them back from, they still have compassion and in many cases more than most because they’ve focused on building compassion for so long as part of their belief structures. They also understand the basics of why things are right and wrong past “because god said so”. There would be some moral confusion for sure but the point is their insistence on their religion might sound like “because their would be no morals outside of religion” but imo the reality is they really would just have to rebuild their whole worldview and they will come up with any excuse to avoid destroying their whole understanding of the world."
It’s more to set a guideline for people back in the day old days hundreds of years ago.
Its not about being a better person!

They'll say really fucked up shit, but then say something like: ""but Jesus loves everyone"" or ""but Jesus wouldn't want that"" and whatnot. So adding that to the end of what you just said makes it okay...??? Like wtf?!?!"
"Good unpopular opinion.

Because like most opinions that conflict with history, it isn't too popular! Good job OP.

If it weren't for religion, all societies would still be horrible. All of humanity needed religion, and we're just lucky to benefit from it still!"
I agree with you completely.  Here is a video of [Steve Harvey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWJ9ylZkS2s) pretty much saying what your mother said.
"While I agree that what your mother said is messed up, I would like to point out that many of the western morals were founded upon religion. 

>What if that religion never existed? 

Then maybe our morals as we know them wouldn't exist in the first place. 

>**She even said that she would've killed me and my siblings by now if it weren't for god. Yeah.......Really. Smh.**

I know this is a bit far-fetched but maybe she meant by that she would've had an abortion instead? Abortions aren't illegal in many places but many Christians believe that abortion is a sin."
"Wow. I love this, it's powerful and holds a good amount of truth."
"My very religious friend was commenting why would a 75 years old be at a protest, get pushed and eventually hospitalised. He should just stayed at home. Any changes wouldn't benefit him.

I replied he's not doing it for himself.

My friend doubled down. Exactly, he should have just stayed at home."
"I appreciate your opinion, but I disagree strongly. There is nothing wrong with saying ""I was this way and my life was going, then X happened and this is how I act/think/feel differently."" This world is full of cause and effect (I could think of similar things in business, careers, war, etc.)  that changes people's lives, and its not terrible to acknowledge you were headed down a bad path and now you aren't. I actually think it's good for humility."
"Nevertheless, there exist people who refrain from doing wrong only because they think god will hurt them if they do.

Hate it that that's true, but it is."
"Friendly Atheist reminder: If you are a Christian and the only reason why you are nice is because you don't want to end up in hell, you will probably end up in hell!"
"I mean, the very foundation of Christianity is that you are born a piece of shit, you will always be a piece of shit, and if you accept Jesus you can get into heaven DESPITE being a piece of shit."
Just... how is this an unpopular opinion? I've agreed with this my whole life. I never knew it wasnt a common way of thinking.

"Over quarentine I've been thinking a lot and came up with the philosophy that you should do good things to do good things, and if there by any chance is an afterlife than I get in, but in the likelihood that it isn't, I'll no on my deathbed that most people will remember me for being at the least a decent human being.

"Religion is like Baby's First Moral Values that never progresses past toddler level because it's marketed to people who need to be spoon-fed their morals through a rule book rather than pursuing inner work and change. It's a lot easier to declare that you are a ""good person"" that way."
">The reason as to why it is messed up is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion.

What's the difference between ""my own moral code"" and ""my religion"" again?"
Same goes for the other way as well.
"Religious people are some of the LEAST critically thinking people on the planet. They live by unquestioned dogma, truly believe they are better than other people, and are WAY more judgemental than most non-religious people."
"Religion was how we used to teach children how to behave in good ways which would help them in their life.

We humans understands stories way better then we understand ""do this and not that"" you can learn things from a story. I think that the atheists and the fundamentalists makes the same mistake about religion they both take it litterary.

We humans needed a unifying morality as our tribes grew larger, we needed a way to accept other people who were strangers. This is what religion allowed us to do, without religion there would be no cities. Today in our atheistic world, things are falling appart so fast you can not even believe it. 

Religion is not a literary true thing, but its true in a mythical allegory sense. It works in the sense it is how we experience the world."
"""When left alone good people will be good and wicked people will be wicked.  But if you want a good person to do something wicked you're going to need religion""  Not my quote"
"Is it really unpopular?
George Carlin said that, it also was in the true detective season 1 and all over teenagers social media...
I thought it's clear that you shouldn't be a douche because you're better then that, not out of fear of punishment"
"Bruh. 

I literally say this all the time. If your reasoning behind being a good person, or doing good things is based on the promise of divine reward, you’re a piece of shit."
"Assuming you grew up in the West, your entire moral code is rooted in Judeo-Christian  philosophy, even if you are completely atheist. 

There isn’t a fundamental moral code all humans are born with. Plenty of human societies have been accepting of really terrible things. Ours is not, and you can thank religion for that."
"My mom was abusive when I was a kid. She has told us on multiple occasions that if didn't go to church she'd still be abusive. And yes, this is true. She joined a small group for troubled women (Basically group therapy ran through the church) it helped her be a better person. I'm proud of her. However, I was abused as a child. I'm not happy with that. She told me in my teens that I was too wild and needed to find God. Well, I did. I read the bible. God's a misogynistic, egotistical prick and he sounds made up. She said I have demons in me. She's right. The demons of my past that she's put there. She said I needed to go to her small group. No. I needed actually therapy. Not Jesus soaked gatherings led by snooty white women with a cause. I'm glad they helped her, but they can't help me. She used the fact that she found help to make herself feel better about the shitty things she did. I still cringe at loud noises. My throat still locks up if someone has a simple grievance. I still have an anxiety ridden overactive bladder. I love my mom, and I'm glad Church helped her, but it's definitely not for everyone, and doesn't justify being shitty."
The world is covered with plenty truely awful people and that's why religions keep being a useful social construct.
"I completely agree that people who need religion to not be horrible are just bad people, although I see it that religion can help someone to reform into a better person and get away from being such a terrible person as it does promote a lot of good work which can influence someone's life and change them for the better."
"I kinda get this argument, but to be honest, I judge people on their actions not their thoughts.

Good example, there are a lot of people who have rape fetishes. Some of these people have consenting sex with a partner they love while role playing, others rape. One person is horrible, the other isn't, but they have the same horrible desire."
"The true unpopular opinion is that we would cherrish the morals and laws that differentiate us from animals and not try to prove that ours are better than the others.Something keeps you away from being animal.Reason,faith,morals, whatever.Just be glad for what makes good people being good and avoid what makes bad people bad"
"There is no such thing as ""your moral code"" outside of your head. To validate the code others should agree with it. Enforcement of the religious moral code is one of the ways to make people agree on what's right or wrong. Some religious people may not realize that perspective or express themselves clearly, some may be dumb and misunderstand things, but in effect what they're arguing for is the uniformity of morality in the society, that's a pretty good idea."
Look up existentialism. I think you might find this philosophy quite attractive
"Lol cringe.
Not to be misanthropic but it's an irrefutable fact that the human condition is basically twisted. All humans are no saint --- religion or no religion."
I think this might be a Sam Harris argument. It was definitely a point made by one of those atheist speakers.
I thought this is a popular opinion
"Your moral code comes from God. All things good come from Him. Little suspicious that everything is in accordance with scripture, don’t ya think.."
"Based on what you said I can understand why you despise religion. Personally I come from a country where only about half the people are religious and that didn't include my family, so I am pretty indifferent to religion.

This really makes me think of Plato's thought experiment *The Ring Of Gyges* from the *Republic, Book II*. Basically what it is saying is that if someone had a ring which granted invisibility they would start of with harmless mischief, and that would advance to petty crime and eventually to absolutely immoral acts like murder (you can see the obvious allusions to this present in LOTR). Does human nature naturally tend towards justice or not? This sort of addresses your question ""what if not for religion"", well, she would be 'invisible'.

""man is just, not willingly or because he thinks justice is any good for him individually, but of necessity, for whenever anyone thinks they can be safely unjust, there he is unjust""

I fully agree that it's pretty fucked to have no respect for the law or society or your family to the point where religion is  the only thing keeping you in check. I'm phrasing this poorly but maybe you see what I mean. All this really does is agree with your point while sounding pretentious, but imo it's pretty interesting when these old ass philosophers say stuff so relatable to us today, makes you think they are into something when their assessment of human nature has stood the test of time. Here's where I yoinked this information from ([https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Plato/plato\_dialogue\_the\_ring\_of\_gyges.html](https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Plato/plato_dialogue_the_ring_of_gyges.html))"
"If you're doing anything to stop yourself from being a bad person, it means you understand it and you're making a conscious effort to become better. It doesn't have to be religion."
"Actions define good/bad - What is going on in a persons mind is for them. 

Your in the wrong sub. You need to get some help before this turns into a life destroying ""mommy issue"" .  Im not kidding Im being sincere. Please talk to a professional who can help you deal with this mental abuse."
This is not an unpopular opinion lol
"I used to believe the same thing, but some people need therapy to control the anger that turns them into horrible people. Some people need AA to keep them away from the alcohol that transforms them into horrible people. Some people are better with religion. Some people are worse with it. Some people are better without it. I don't personally invest in organized religion but I doubt it's going anywhere any time soon. It's been around for centuries and probably will exist for many more. What I'd like to see is a culture that calls people out when they abuse religion the way an addict abuses drugs."
I need religion to don't feel lonely :/
"What is right and wrong is subjective. Every persons influence in their life guides their moral compass. 

Many people are influenced by parents, by teachers, by family members, or by religion to help their brains decide what is right and wrong.

Could it be argued that because you needed your parents influence to decide what is wrong and right instead of your own brain makes you a horrible person? You could argue that no adult truly makes a decision on their own because along the way they have been influenced by something or someone."
"What if you are the nicest person ever? Like completely devoting your time and resources to others, non-judgemental, etc. 

Now lets say, this person only does these things out of a fear of god. Furthermore, lets say they kept the whole religion part completely secret.

Would a life spent completely in pursuit of 'good' actions (for god) not make you a good person? For good measure, lets also say that this religion is completely moral - other than the fact its god is one to be feared."
"I mean, we always needed/had something to establish that something is bad. If it isn't religion, then it's laws. If it's not laws, it's societal norms. If I was trapped and kept alive in a box with no access to anything related to the outside world and after 20 years they let me out, how would I know that something like murder is bad? I probably wouldn't even know what murder was. So would I be a bad person too? This is, of course an extreme hypothetical example, but I think my point still stands. It's important to note that I'm a religious person (because of how it has positively impacted my life) and I advocate it (but I'm not a dick about it).

I hope no one jumps at my throat for what I've just said, as it is only my opinion and if you disagree, please, I would love to discuss the issue in a civil manner where look at each other neutrally."
"I think that if you're normally as asshole and you're using religion as a reason to curb your assholeishness, then you're actually a good person who's understood their flaws and is trying to better themselves for others."
"Ma’am”
“It’s not much"
This is not an unpopular opinion.
"Humans are communal animals, their communities determine what is good and bad. A person tends to display the morals from the society they were raised in. There are always exceptions, but generally, that is the case."
"If God is real, and he is kind, then he wouldn't judge you on whether or not you believed in him. If God is not just, and he judges you based on whether or not you worshipped him, than we should not worship an unjust god. If God is not real, we lose nothing by making the world a better place when trying to get to heaven"
The old fashioned Reddit “Religion bad” post
"Before people gathered in large groups (think neanderthal), everybody did what they wanted; protecting their own small group by killing intruders, and then raping the dead warrior's women, etc. Religion was/is a way to keep people in larger groups from killing each other, thus moral laws were codified, and we entered into the age of society.

Nowadays many people think, ""Oh we don't need religion, we can just live by our own moral codes."" Wrong. To have a unified body of a hundred, two hundred million or even 1.6 billion people (think China), you need something to control that group, so you either have laws, or religion, or both. Big countries like the US will probably splinter because of the differences in opinion of what's right or wrong.

It is naive to believe you can live by your own moral code without any influence from society. It is because of the broad reaching legal interpretation of civil liberties that you can entertain that notion in the first place."
"I agree with you to an extent but you have no basis for your morality, in fact your own position exists because of the Judeo-Christian worldview. I think you’re underestimating the degree to which religion, and especially Judeo-Christian theology, has impacted your own moral positions."
"without religion there are no good or bad actions, so it doesn't really matter."
You are correct.
"This is true

HOWEVER if someone can find happiness and pleasure from practicing religion and don't threaten others or themselves with hell and heaven religion is great"
"Religion is used to control the masses even though murder, robbery, and destruction still occurs almost daily. If blaming Religon to stop doing bad things makes you a terrible person, I wonder what you consider a person who does them despite a religon or not.

What's moral to someone is based on their own personal opinion. The majority of others morals may align slightly with popular opinion, but can differ depending on experiences. The morals of me, you, someone in a different country, someone from 50 years ago, and the person you look up to can be completely different."
"Chocolate Brownie has to be, not lowered ricers."
"I disagree, we need our parents to tell us right from wrong, that does not mean we are terrible people.  No one is perfect and God helps us to right our wrongs."
"Where did the moral code of which you speak originate if not from religion? It can’t be from pure reason, because in many situations in may be perfectly reasonable, although immoral, to murder someone or steal something for your own benefit."
"""Most of the evil in this world is done by people with good **intentions**.""

“One of the great mistakes is to **judge** policies and programs by their **intentions** rather than their **results**”.

No one gives a shit if you're being genuine or not when you're not punching someone's face in. Also western morality originates from judeochristian values, so what you now see as the decent thing wasn't so obvious back in the day and even today."
"Look I'm against religion for my own reasons, and as I do see your point I disagree. So you shouldn't be good BECAUSE of your religion, you must be good because of your own moral code? Whose to say which is actually more important (to each individual). I mean, ""the right way"" to behave depends on each person and what they deem to be true right. I don't think being religious and having good morals are always exclusive. It's possible to have both. Anyway, I disagree so here have an upvote :)"
"I've found some religious ppl will tell you their darkest fantasies when they find out you're atheist. ""You're an atheist? Where does your moral compass come from? What stops you from kidnapping & raping a bus full of teenage girls?"""
"That’s kind of the point of many religions though; that we are inherently horrible people.  We have concepts of good and bad but consistently choose the worse of the two options.

Religions give a lot of people a mental/spiritual anchor.  They’re still horrible people, and too often instead of using the religion to elevate themselves they just twist the religion into a horrible thing to use against others because.. you got it, people are horrible.

This was actually a major plot point of the gospels of the New Testament.  Which we’ve also corrupted."
"I agree. I've often been asked since I'm an atheist, what keeps me from killing people or stealing or doing bad things. I will often respond with ""what keeps YOU from doing those things?"" Is it your own person feeling that those things are wrong or is it fear of religious punishment?"
IMHO religion is responsible for more horrible things than it has ever prevented.
[Steve Harvey disagrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWJ9ylZkS2s).
Yes of course. But what about people’s moral barometer? How can we know?
"Let’s talk about moral relativism first. If there is no God, then all morality is relative. If all morality is relative, then whether you choose to be the second mother Theresa or the second Adolf Hitler, doesn’t matter. You don’t need God or religion to “be moral”, but if there is no God, what does it matter?"
My classm8 judges me and my long time bestfriend (me and her have been friends for 10 plus years) over us holding hands
"""If there is no god, then what's stopping you from [insert example of horrible human behaviour]""

No. You shouldn't kill people. You shouldn't kill animals for no reason. You shouldn't rape/molest. You shouldn't lie. You shouldn't extort. You shouldn't be a glutton. 

Why? Because it doesn't do anything for the greater good of you as an individual, people around you, the future generations, the planet itself. 

You should be nice to people, just for the sake of being nice and/or making someone's day. You should be generous when you donate. You should have control over what and how much you eat. Etc. Etc. etc.

Why do people think if there's no god, there are no rules?

Do you see the life you have? You should count yourself lucky that you survived as long as you have. And you should do things to continue on your species. Because everyone before you worked to create the world there is today. And you should build a better world for the people to come. 

Having no god DOESN'T JUSTIFY BAD BEHAVIOUR. IT JUST MAKES YOU A DICK."
"Exactly. This is pretty much the main argument that my family uses to guilt trip me about, that as an atheist I'll never have a moral compass. They're the weak ones if they seriously can't be ethical without the concept of big bad sky daddy looming over them."
"Your moral code is based on  Judeo-Christian religion whether you like it or not, it's impossible to not be influenced by it.  

There are lots of cultures in history that did things / do things that are considered amoral by ours today.

 I don't think people avoid behaviours because they will be punished necessarily.  If there were no courts would people commit those crimes?  Not likely.  It's just a saying."
"Thats pretty common in very religious person. And then they think atheists are all bad people and psychos because they conclude they are like them.

&#x200B;

NO you idiots. Im just a decent person, thats it. But it makes me somewhat happy that there are religions. Some people apparently need it."
"Actually, I'm pretty sure Christian theology lines up with this exactly. Everyone is in fact a terrible person, and there's no hope for ""goodness"" apart from Christ. Why would we need saving at all if we could be ""good people"" on our own?

I'm pretty sure this is the core of why the secular world finds Christianity offensive. It straight up denies the idea that ""deep down, everyone is a good person"". We all justly deserve Hell, not Heaven, and it's only by God's undeserved grace that anyone at all is saved."
"No everyone is your mom dude... it’s totally ok and even human nature, that some people’s religion and faith is tied directly to their ethical and moral compass."
"Empathy, compassion and common sense all seem to be ignored when that big black book gets rapped over your knuckles."
"Agreed. Every person is born with a natural disposition i.e basic moral code to determine what is right /wrong. Religion is there to teach how to worship God, not to prove existence of God."
Another great post from /r/popularopinion
"The idea that our morality comes from a perfect being, us being imperfect, in turn causes our perceptions to be so. There would be no way to say what is right or wrong through religion because it’s coming from us as people and not an omnipotent being. The counter is that we were told by “God” and it spoke through a medium. However they only spoke of morality in relation to their environments which is pretty obvious someone wrote some shit THEY felt like was right."
"Look up ""Patton Oswalt sky cake"". It covers this topic pretty nicely."
most people don't say religion keeps them from doing horrible things it just keeps them from doing bad things like drugs drinking lying gossiping etc. there's nobody that needs religion to not rape murder or rob a bank i'm not really religious myself but I understand how people just want religion to have a reason to life and not be terrified of death and it looks like it's working
So when can I expect to see an unpopular opinion on /unpopularopinions?
"I mean... how is this logic any different with anything else? Would it make you a terrible person because you had a fit of rage but you didn’t hit someone because they could press charges against you? No. 

Just a reminder to all non-religious people: religious people are fallible, just like you."
Same with zodiac signs
Everybody has a horrible side lurking inside and it can be easily developed when conditions are met. If you think ppl in such a black and white way it's the same mistake those religious evangelists made.
"I'm atheist but I dunno.

We're all shaped by our environment. In the absence of good parents, or some other communal force... I can see religion getting people on a positive path."
"Lol okayyy buddy, yeah go on and tell the troubled souls their religion is shit even though it’s the only thing stopping them from killing people. Sounds like a great idea.
Just let people be and be thankful you’re not tied up in chains in someone’s basement still alive while they cut off your limbs off with a hacksaw. Just Bc you aren’t religious doesn’t mean you need to ruin it for others."
"Even without religion, you have the benefit of living in a society that has learned from the atrocities committed by past generations."
"You are correct in your thinking, but this line of thinking used to make me feel like religion was useless and stupid, since it shouldn't be needed to prevent you from doing bad things. 

However, since then I've reflected even more and would argue that what your mother should have said is that religion can help you do great things. 

Doing great things is really hard work. It takes dedication and faith and if your really looking to achieve something toward the upper end of your potential, using some sort of religious thinking helps wrangle your brain into fostering these qualities. 

It doesn't have to be  a belief in a story book God but just in the realization of just how complicated the universe and everyday life truly is. If you're trying to live your best life, fostering respect for reality and all the unknowable will help keep you on the right track toward that difficult goal.

Edit: And by ""Great things"" I don't mean on a global scale. I mean on an individual scale. 

If you're a person who's accomplished things to the point where people truly listen to you when you speak, that's a great thing. That's not easy to do. That takes effort out of you every day to become someone like that.

I know many people who speak a lot but no one truly listens to them because they've failed to ever gain anything to give themselves credibility. 

So I'm saying religious type thinking and behavior can benefit you when your goal is to accomplish things in life so you can have a greater influence to promote what is good from your perspective. When you do that it makes your perspective more valuable, which makes your life more valuable, which makes all of your actions more valuable, which helps you and everyone around you better enjoy the fact that you're alive."
Our whole code of ethics is based off of generations of religion. Yeah sure if you snapped your fingers and got rid of religion today everyone would hold more or less the same ethics. But thats today. And in general yes people are horrible. We are animals. And we have the intelligence to take the cruelty of nature to new levels. And we need a system that gives us both morality and community. Its not perfect but neither are we and for all the faults that edgy atheists like to point out religion in the west has been mostly positive. Inb4 muh crusades.
"Decade plus four, not shallow."
"If you spend your whole life pretending to be a good person, you are indistinguishable from a good person."
"Reading Ecclesiastes rn. There’s a lot in there about this. Without God why do you do the thing you do? Without God all is vanity. 

Also in Ecclesiastes there a line about how every man is made for eternity. You are going to live forever. As a human beings we deserve to go to Hell and there is no way we can take the punishment for sin. That’s why God sent his son, Jesus to die for us and take our sin upon himself.  With that sacrifice we are now perfect in God’s eyes and can enter heaven and live out eternity with him.

Your moral code should be informed by what the Bible teaches and a desire to be more like Jesus.

DM me if you want to ask more questions. :)"
"Im not religious but I practice the bare minimum expected of a Muslim and I agree with you. We're all humans living in the same space.  Even outside of religion it just makes sense to have morals in a community. 

Besides, Islam itself states that you have to follow the laws of the country in which you live as long as it doesn't forbid you from practicing Islam (I know this is sort of unrelated but just though I'd add it to let people know isn't as backward as you might think)"
"This is an essential belief of many religions, ranging from ""I am completely and utterly not good"" to""I need help"". Various religions promise to remedy the evil we find in ourselves. 

Religious people should ask themselves what part of religion makes them want to be good. Is it a yearning to be good that they feel in solitude, a yearning that prompts them to pray? Or is it a desire to simply look good that pops up around other people in their church? I think you're rightly calling out the latter or someone similar..."
"I do not think it work this way. 

Religion in most cases is just a oldschool explanation of human life cycle. Some read Marquez some bible..."
"I think we all need three things to be good people

1. Motivation.
2. Learning from mistakes.
3. Abillity to change it.

Motivation: Without motivation you feel no need to change or strive to be good, then you'll just coast through life and end up neutral or where life puts you.

Learning: Without learning from mistakes you won't keep growing, some things we might do wrong our whole life, but some things we can learn where wrong.

Abillity/opportunity: This is partially to say, if someone did something horrible, and we throw them in prision for the rest of their life, or kill them. They have no opportunity to be good people any more. Or if you are starving and need to steal food to survive you aren't bad because you're bad, but you don't have the luxury to be good."
Super duper crazy vastly popular mainstream opinion. Downvoted for cheap karma whoring.
If you need therapy to get out of depression you are a depressed person. No one going to church is sitting there thinking that if they go out they will do horrible things. real Christianity comes from your own decision to do and be better every day. You should not feel or be forced to do so.
At least they’ll just be a terrible person and not a horrible person
"While I don't disagree, I do have a similar viewpoint to your mother's, albeit less extreme. Hear me out on this.

For me personally, it stops me from being a selfish person. If we were really destined for the void of nothingness, why should I give a literal shit about anyone else outside my immediate friends and family? Why care for the betterment of humanity if I'm not going to be around to see it? 

Religion helps justify to myself why I should be kind to strangers or go out helping random people. Sure it gives me the warm and fuzzies and it's nice seeing people's appreciation, but I believe that the smallest acts of kindness can save a life, and what greater value is there than in an eternal one?"
"They say morality is what you do when you think nobody is watching.

In religion you think there is always someone watching."
"Nah this is a pretty fucking popular opinion. It's regurgitated on this site again and again and again. And doesn't this fall under one of the mega-threads already? I guess if the mods actually agree with it, it doesn't get surpressed. Cool."
"If religion makes you a better person, then good for you, and I hope more people are like you. But religion is not moral compass of people, no matter how much the religious Right claims to be. I always thought this was common sense."
"Here's the real unpopular opinion:   


All people are terrible people. You are the most vile creature to ever walk the face of the Earth, but plot twist, there's 7+ billion of them currently alive.   


The main issue that people have with religion is that is exposes them for what they are: evil.   


The Christian Bible takes things one step further and shows that we hate the light/good because we love darkness and the light exposes us."
"To put it more simply...

Those who fear God should"
So. Which moral code should we follow.
"I think you look at it from a different perspective then religious people. A lot of orthodox Christians believe that the human being in itself is by definition not good (fall of man/original sin) and all good comes from / is inspired by God.

So the difference is, these people do ‘not need religion not to be a horrible person’, but they seek all that is good outside themselves, where others may see it as a good personally trait. So in a way it’s a very humble attitude.

This is often what Christians mean when they say they would not do good without God."
"Oh come on, this is the most popular opinion on the Internet"
"If you need rules in general to be a half decent human being, Idk, sounds like fail to me."
"A huge point in the Bible is that God changes our hearts. It sure as tough maybe get heart has not changed. Not good, obviously."
"Yeah that's like the only use of religion nowadays. To keep stupid people from doing stupid things by giving them rules that keep them from doing said stupid things.

If you're not a stupid person you actually don't need those rules, because your own moral code will prevent you from doing stupid things.

The good thing is that  stupid people tend to believe into stupid stuff without any evidence so they are drawn towards religion and its rules."
Just another reason I've never believed I need religion.
Your morals are influenced by religion through society.
"What if I told you that not everyone's idea of a ""horrible person"" is the same? Someone took your valuables because they were corrupting your mind? Someone murdered your family ""for their own good/so they could be free/go to a better place."" Someone sneezed on you so you could develop immunity? etc. etc.

I'm sorry your mother has said these things to you. I hope that she is someday able to realize that she was being a horrible person to you...and the damage she has done. Do a little more thinking, OP. If a religion forces you to do something, was it really the right religion in the first place? Or a cult? Did you ever think that we may need religion precisely so that we may retain free will? Perhaps it wasn't the religion, but your mom being controlling?

If you are a teenager, I highly recommend reading ""The Cartoon Introduction to Philosophy"" by Patton and Cannon. It's a fun comic book that will help you expand on these thoughts. You seem bright, so I think that you'd really enjoy reading it."
"There is a pop sociology book called ""of Cannibals and Kings; the origin of Cultures"" by Marvin Harris that you might like...."
I am religious and totally agree. People shouldn't maintain integrity only because of god.
"For the sake of reexamining the argument, try it with a different word:

""If you need **medication** to not be horrible person, and to stop you from doing horrible things, then you are a terrible person.""

I get where you're coming from, but there's no uncertainty that Buddhism has developed me into a better person.

Yeah, sometimes I won't do something only because I have a vow not to do it, like refraining from intentionally killing insects. But after a while you decide not to do those things anyway because you end up caring more about other beings. I like saving insects and letting them outside, even if it makes me look stupid.

If you meditate it reduces negative emotions pretty quickly and gives you insight into what causes them. Fear of hell isn't really part of that equation. There are very useful tools in some religions, and to cast it all as being tossed around by fear I'd say would be an outsider's perspective of the worst parts of religion.

I'd imagine a Christian would refrain from doing bad things out of fear, but ALSO more often than not they would do good things because they feel God's love. There's a connection there which they're lucky to have, which I don't have. If they have to be afraid of doing wrong, I'd say it still produces the result that helps society in the end. And over time their urge to do bad things diminishes greatly."
Definitely a popular opinion on reddit
"if you can stop yourself from doing horrible things repeatedly you are not a horrible person.

You are a coping individual with different skills than I use to get there."
Lol has anyone here seen the show Ramy? That’s exactly what OP made me think about
"Ok, so several things here. The religion is the moral code. There is no tangible difference in distinguishing because both are saying, I won’t do x because of x. 

It could be law, it could be moral code( belief system) or it could be religion (also belief system)

Second, where did your moral code come from? Quite likely it was largely influenced by your mother. For better or worse, your own beliefs are intrinsically tied to hers. So your own ideas are very much tied to her perception, your compass points where it does because of her in many ways. 

Your codes foundation was laid by you mother’s beliefs. Who told you hurting others was bad? Your mother probably did very early in your life, and the world around you continued too. 

Your code may not have the same beginning, but many ends are probably similar. Don’t lie, cheat, steal, kill, etc. 

Choosing to elevate your belief system over someone else is what fuels religious wars, ideological wars, and all the negative interactions we have on a broad scale. The only time it’s acceptable to put down a belief system is when the OUTCOME is negative. If you believe that some class of people should be killed for example. 

As long as the end point of your code, beliefs, or whatever the fuck you’re following is a net positive, why the hell should I care?"
LTTP: Religion is a social construct. It does not exist in individuals. What you think and believe bear no consequence if it remains entirely inside your mind.
"This seems to be a fairly popular opinion on reddit.  


I think an unpopular opinion would be - People shouldn't only rely on religion to make them morally upright, but there is nothing wrong with religion helping to improve the lives / morals of people."
"If people need to believe that something else besides their own will is keeping them from doing something and it’s working for them, then it’s working for them. Doesn’t make them a bad personality, just week willed in some situations."
"I seem to recall that Jesus said, ""Unless you be born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God."""
This seems like a hugely popular opinion on reddit
"Well, religion thought us this and now our parents can share this information without religion"
"You say this coming from a western country that has the benefit of a Judeo-Christian background. Your ability to make your own moral system is not yours. It's based off theirs, and by not being ""religious,"" you already fall short on some major moral truths. However, if you came from somewhere else that didn't have this framework, you would have a totally different view of moral good, and that may be in complete opposition to the objective moral reality, making you an immoral person."
"For those religious peeps, which I am no longer believing in. I was told that the BIBLE stands for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. As in take all the good parts to help build a moral code for yourself, learn from it and update your life with a good understanding of what human decency is and apply that to others."
You dont need to be religious to be a good person but if religion never existed in the first place our morals would be a whole lot different than they are today. Like how in western countries it's considered wrong to rape a women but in some middle east countries women are property and raping them is not morally wrong to them.
"I've always thought this. My dad is religious and when I told him I wasn't he said ""If we don't follow the scripture how will we know what to do? What's right and wrong?"" Like wtf. I just assess situations, think about it, sometimes do a little research and go from there. He asked me why I wouldn't cheat on my husband since I don't think ""someone is always watching me"". Uhmmmmmm, I respect and love my husband. My dad refuses to believe that could be possible."
"Ok, I see what you're saying. Your mother saying ""I would have killed you if it wasn't for God"" is just one step short of harassment. That's like ""Oh, if I wouldn't be sent to jail, I would have killed you."" Thanks mom, love you too.

Now that being said, I do have family members that do have a ""God saved me from my evil self"" mentality, and I believe them. But you can replace it with ""A friend that believed in me saved me from my evil self."" (But these are things like addiction and bad habits. Human weaknesses that may affect others.)

Because I do believe that some of them would have lost hope in themselves as a ""good person"" if it wasn't for God. It's really easy for someone to believe that once they've gone down a certain path, then there's no point for them to turn back and be a good person. ex. ""If all people think of me as is a thief,(jerk, addict, gambler, etc.) might as well be that.""

So, if these family members had others, like friends or family members or social workers, who believed they could become better people and that they could actually start with a ""clean slate"", then it would be basically the same effect, (but believing in a God is more effective sometimes, because God can see everything.)

So, yes? Christian theology states that one can be redeemed despite their fallen, imperfect state.But IMO, this does not mean that said Christians should fantasize murders, rapes, or other abhorrent sins and then say ""Good thing I'm a Christian, or I would have totally done that."" Yeesh. 

(there are some people who have plaguing thoughts and it's a real thing, but there's a difference between being haunted by your thoughts and being indulgent in your fantasies.)"
"Thing is weve killed each other even before the existence of religion and weve killed and are  also killing each other with the existence of religion. Conclusion: Humans aren't great with or without religion. So the question is, in the grand scheme of things, what makes a person good?  Youve said that the only reason some religious people dont inflict harm upon others is because of the moral constraints imposed upon them by their religion. However, doesnt everyone follow a code based on a set of principles? Doesnt everyone stop themselves from inflicting harm because a set of principles stops them from doing so? Does that make them a bad person because they abide by a set of rules imposed on them by society because no one grows with an in-built moral code- its shaped and moulded by your environment. Essentially, thats why we have laws in place- humans arent capable of governing themselves properly- anarchy would ensue. I guess it all stems from the classic ol question of whether you believe that humans are inherently good or not and how important is society role in pushing them towards either path."
Id counter this with people tend to think out scenarios with the worst possible outcomes. I know atheists who do this exact same thing but say they wont ever go through with it because they dont want to go to jail. Its all the same. Religion isnt special.
The pattern would suggest that people who “love” the Bible are a bit too pushy about it and rub off the wrong way. It seems the love quickly turns into obsession and then into the only the way
But humanity kinda is horrible people so i think all religions have a purpose as cristians have the 10 rules to not steal or kill etc. And i think that religion was originally founded because people wanted to enforce rules even though there was a king emperor or dictator or some one guy making the rules and i think religion was just the first tries to make democracy kind of but just not voting
"Despite the fact that religion itself has been the cause for an incalculable quantity of atrocities, I believe what they mean is things like the ten commandments provide an absolute baseline for moral human behavior.

I also believe that people who require religion to guide them wouldn't necessarily be horrible people, I just believe they would latch onto anything that felt greater than themselves and guided them in a direction but positivity. That way they can mark on a map where they stand in the moral perspective"
"Morality is subjective. If everyone decides their own moral code then you can't judge someone for deciding that murdering someone else is wrong. Most people are Utilitarian when it comes to morality: The greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. However, there's no basis for that being the only acceptable moral code. Others might have a moral code along the lines of ""Whatever makes me happy"" or fanatics that believe lying, cheating or breaking promises is worse than any other crime and that it deserves death. 

Without any common ground, without some sort of objective morality, we've no grounds to condemn anyone else's moral code. Our society today uses social media to establish a kind of group consensus on morality. We share videos of people doing evil things so we can all point and shout ""that's horrible"" to virtue signal and validate each other's moral codes. The problem with that sort of system is that it could very easily become like the Salem Witch Hunt Trials. As long as everyone agrees that a specific thing is wrong then that thing is wrong. It's also why racism, homophobia and xenophobia have been difficult to get rid of. The general consensus was that it was ok to be racist, homophobic or xenophobic until 50 or so years ago. 

Religion provides a better objective base for morality. One that doesn't shift with the desires of the population. Murder will always be wrong. Stealing will always be wrong. Etc. Even if people don't follow it to the letter it can still provide a lot of needed context for morality. It has parables, examples, stories, characters that all show the reasons for these morals. 

People simply need guidance ""to not be horrible person, and to stop you from doing horrible things"". For a long time religion was the best source of that guidance. It's arguable that it still is the best source of that guidance due to the mob nature of our internet collective. However, with the internet allowing the promotion of certain ideas over others we can provide our own subjective group morality. A morality centred around what benefits the group rather than individual morality that would benefit individuals. 

Essentially, if we all decide that breeding and killing animals for food is fine then it's fine. If we all decide that breeding and killing humans for genetic efficiency is wrong then it's wrong. 

That's a bit of a ramble but hopefully that explains the sources of morality, why a more objective morality is better, as well as our most common form of morality."
Agreed entirely dude. I wish I could give u an award
"I've actually heard people say ""Well, if you don't believe in God, what stops you from going around murdering and raping people?"" As if if their scripture didn't tell them not to, that that's exactly what they'd be doing. Those are the people that terrify me."
Religion has killed more people than anything else. Just be a good person. It'll come back tenfold.

"Nobody's using religion as an excuse, I imagine such people find it comforting to have a 'reason' to keep going or abstaining. the important thing is that they're they're not doing the ""bad thing;"" who cares what the reason is.

As opposed to the majority of people in reddit who think they're in the right/on the right side of history and proceed to be the most abusive monsters imaginable, calling everyone they disagree with 'pieces of shit.' They don't even think they're doing anything wrong to need religion to stop."
"“Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn’t be a dick” “you shouldn’t abstain cause rape just cause you think that I want you to, you shouldn’t rape because rape is a fucked up thing to do” - Bo Burnham in the song From gods perspective. I always thought this song pointed out some very interesting things about religion which your pointing out, if there is a god who knows everything, why would they care that we didn’t do things just because we read a book that said they didn’t want us to. I believe that they would look down on people who needed that motivation to not be shitty just as much as people who were shitty and didn’t believe in god."
I'm so sorry on behalf of Christians for your mother's actions... God loves u even if U don't believe in him.  A Christian should not have hurt u in that way as we are called to love everyone as everyone is created in the image of God. I hope U understand how most of the Christian community reacts to these people.
"It’s funny that people agree with this, since morality is culturally relative and the basis for most modern western morality has its basis in Judeo- Christian religion. Of course even those tenets were relative to the culture that believes in them. Thou shalt not kill, unless it’s those damn Philistines and it’s a time to kill. Even the basis of Christ’s teachings were relative to the situation he was in as an anti- Roman rabbi who never personally sought to spread his message to anyone outside of ancient Israel. Only after his death and his followers not finding many believers amongst their fellow Israelites did they spread out, and the mythos grew."
"At the surface this seems like a silly topic, but it really boils down to some deep fundamental existential questions:
1. Are people basically good? ie, is the default position of humanity good? ( or evil?)
2. Is there a moral frame of reference? Some religions will claim an absolute truth from which morality ca. Be framed ( subjective ), if you take that away, then morality is objective. Who determines what is right or wrong?"
"I feel like religion is more of a general guideline not to be an asshole yknow? like there’s “rules”, commandments, etc."
"I think it depends on *how* they use religion. If they're only nice for the reward of going to heaven, then yes, they're a bad person. But if they know what they're doing is wrong and they want to change for the better so they use the Bible for general moral guidance (whether they believe in God or not), I think that makes them a better person because they're making an effort to be better."
"But If you think about it If there is no god or anything saying what is right and what is wrong, then moral becomes arguable opinion and nobody could say that they are more right or wrong about it so i would deffinetly say that its not stupid or making your mom stupid or horrible person, just honest."
"There is a general assumption that people are evil by nature, which is generally true, and that we learn certain norms of what is right or wrong by different means. I think that religion is just one of those means, but it can also be from being raised in a good household, or even the presence of criminal/federal laws. The interesting thing about law is that they originated from what a hypothetical God/Prophet might've told their believers. People need religion like a crutch, meaning that it might not be as helpful for a person who is all well and healthy, but can greatly help someone who is hindered. I honestly doubt that people who do horrible things ever think about what some God might be judging them for, and even if they do, chances are that their perspective is skewed or deranged. Also, religions such as Christianity or Judaism are based off of beliefs that have mostly been the fundamentals of any good person, such as self-improvement or sacrifice for a greater good. I myself didn't really pay much attention to religion, and mainly saw it as a scapegoat for bad people. However, it became clear to me that it might just be because of negative past experiences I've had with it, which are mostly to do with the community/people you happen to be around, rather than what the community is supposed to be based off of."

"I agree, I think you're right in your assessment. Covid-19 has shown me that people whom I thought had good religious values do not. They were using their religion as a crutch. I know it should have been obvious to me."

"While I agree with you for the most part religion had a huge part in civilising humans. A major example of this was the Arabs before Islam, they were nudists rapists and would bury newborn girls in the sand as they would rather have sons. But when Prophet Mohammad introduced Islam it radically changed the world for the better as it spread from India to Europe during the Islamic golden ages. Islam introduced the freeing of slaves, women's rights, basic human respect, and more. If it weren't for some religions the world would be very different in some parts of the world."
"It reminds me of the existential prison episode of ""The Midnight Gospel"" when he made the comparison of trying to deepen their relationship with religion and grinding a character in World of Warcraft.

"Let’s replace the word religion with “police”, “government”, or “legal system” shall we?

You simply want to have a dig at religion, but we are all horrible. We are all born “sinners”. We have bad thoughts about people. We want to hurt people. We get jealous of people. But we are also capable of good. 

What if religion turns someone from a horrible person to a charitable person? All because they believe in universal justice from God? You accuse them of being a terrible person, but perhaps that’s the point. God gives them hope. He gives them something to strive for."
"I think there is a much deeper underlying theoretical question here too. And it’s not just about evil, but also about our pleasures (these are actually connected in my view). Aka, if there are no consequences for ones actions, and we all disappear in the end, then does that mean life is meaningless? And if it’s meaningless, then shouldn’t we maximize our pleasure while we are on earth? Sure doesn’t mean we suddenly kill people, but there’s other selfish things we can do because it makes us feel good, but hurts others. It’s like, why do some religious people have so much self control? (Thinking monks). I think that’s what a lot of religious people mean when they talk about not doing something because of God."
"Religion is literally to justify being a horrible racist asshole throughout all of recorded history.  Religious people are literally intellectual garbage and shouldn't be allowed to vote, drive, or have children. It's 2020 and scared dumb people still need to imagine an invisible man in the sky."

Nobody would disagree with you on this yet you are getting upvoted.
"I think you misunderstand. For at least, the reason religion stops me from doing bad things isn't fear of hell or want of reward from God. Instead it's like having an additional voice of reason, stepping in when my conscience fails. God doesn't impose fear or offer some reward for good behaviour instead aids my moral compass into at the least trying to make good and just choices."
At least theyre trying.  You are not helping.
"I used to think this too when I was younger. I was raised Catholic and was an atheist by age 16, as a result of being raised Catholic. Stayed that way for ten years. My atheism was grounded in the belief that people didn't need religion, they were born with a moral compass and all you had to do was ""be a good person"". Religion was the ""opiate of the masses"" and all that. It took me ten years to realize that is bullshit. I think religion is seldom understood, especially by those who profess to believe it. The hard reality is that our humanity can be an evil thing. We murder, rape, steal, wage war, etc. We are not born ""good."" We are all capable of these things, as little as we'd like to admit it. Where would you have been in 1942 if you lived in Nazi Germany? Probably on the side of the Nazi's. It's angering but it's true. Religion was a great tool for us to build civilizations in the past, to organize our people under a moral code. Now I won't argue that the churches/organizations have perverted the actual meaning of these religions over time, but I think there's way more to religion and how it relates to the human psyche throughout history for us to just write people off as ""stupid"" or ""terrible""."

"Something to consider (note: not religious at all, and I \*overall\* agree with this) 

> The reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion 

This is very true, if you were able to to be taught a good moral code as a child, many don't, and unfortunately is not something that is easily picked up on by just ""livin' life"". When people reach adulthood and they've been treated like absolute trash there whole life, its a large expectation for them to just be a good person. 

For these individuals, religion provides them the moral code they never had. Now, does have to be religion? Absolutely not, its just the most common pass to it. 

But it does suck to hear ""if it were for Jesus, I would be such a terrible person"". Its the same that ticks me off about like - telling a surgeon who just saved your child's like ""thank god"". No ma'am, thank that surgeon."

"The only thing stopping me from being a horrible person is the consequences of my actions, like if I murdered someone, how would their family feel? Could they be going through rough times, and I killed the parent doing the work for them? Or what if I robbed a bagel store, and the owner was about to lose his building? What matters most is the consequences of doing these actions, and some religious people follow this same mindset. Some people who say “religion stops me from doing this” may be referring to a different concept tide to religion, like morals."
"I disagree.

There are a subset of people who think “I would’ve done *bad thing* if I didn’t believe in god” who are bad people. These people do it because they fear hell, and no other reason.

However, there are external things that religion can provide that can turn people’s lives around. For example, it answers the question “why am I here”. Without having that soul crushing life consuming question answered I’m sure a number of people who are religious would stop seeing the point in being good. It is a difficult and long journey for anyone who is not religious to come to grips with that question, either coming up with an answer, but most likely becoming comfortable with the fact that it is unanswered.

Another thing it provides is structure and aid. Say there was a guy who went out partying all the time. He had no regard for life, he wasn’t really hurting anyone but was on a path to hurting people and doing messed up things. Then a priest approached him and told him to go to church, and being told to go spread the peace that god willed upon him inspired him to go get a job, go to church every Sunday, and start contributing to society.

In that case (which probably isn’t terribly common, but I do know a few people who this happened to), without religion they would be terrible people, but for completely different reasons.

And maybe the case isn’t that extreme. Maybe someone met their friends through church, and those friends were good people. Who’s to say if he didn’t have religion he wouldn’t have met different friends who might’ve influenced him to do messed up things in the future.

Or maybe someone’s dad quit drinking because of god, so they had a normal childhood as opposed to an abusive one that might’ve turned them into a worse person.

All in all I just think religion is a valuable tool for society. It is misused all the time, but it does a lot more good that I think some people realize."
Thats literally the point of religion.  To reign in barbarians.
"Sounds like you stumbled upon the concept of, ""total depravity"", but still don't understand it. 

Plenty of people think they're a good person, when in reality they are completely horrible. So the entire premise of, ""if you need x to be good, then you are bad"" assumes being good is a default. I gotta tell you, that's complete fantasy. But go ahead trumpeting your moral superiority.  That behavior is obnoxious from religious people, it blows me away when atheists do the same thing without an ounce of self awareness."

"It is an unpopular opinion, but it is also a very true opinion. As a non-believer I hold myself to account for the things I do or do not do. Religion provides a convenient loophole for moral misbehavior, IMO."
Wouldn't this make you a better person?
"You think people act moral within a religion because of fear of harsh punishment. Well that drastically depends on the religion. As a Christian I am vastly against Catholicism as I believe they add a lot of doctrinal nonsense and come from a place of fear being greater then love. Personally I act morally not out of fear at all, for the Bible says that perfect love casts out fear, and to fear not because God is with you. It is out of love and out of seeking a path that is greater and greater in love everyday that I act morally. The fruits of the spirit shine in those who lead their lives by this core fundamental teaching of Christ. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. God is love. If you live your life with love then you know God and he dwells in you. So, if you love you then act morally because it is the natural path."
"This is actually kind of the whole point of Christianity, that without God we are completely lost and depraved. So I agree with you, except that changing your behaviour is the point of any kind of faith, isn’t it? Isn’t it a good thing if people who would be terrible otherwise consciously change their decisions and become better? Although in the example you gave I would also agree that there might be a heart issue there if she still wants to do such things and just doesn’t. But what the bible tells us is that God comes into our hearts and changes us when we accept him, no matter how lost we were before that. 

I also would challenge you that without God as a moral authority, there’s no objective moral good. If God doesn’t exist and the universe just exploded into being, who’s to judge between good people and terrible people?"
"I'd say this is similar in application to those that do not allow medical intervention for themselves or their children under the argument that it is god's will. Yet, they then tell you that god created all. Then, god created the doctor following that statement? Answer is yes. So, if that is the case wouldn't that mean that god gave the doctor the ability to heal people in his name?"

"If such a place as heaven exists, I would rather be judged by my life actions performed without expectation of reward; else I am no more than an circus elephant performing tricks for food."
"Whatever method helps you do good, then you do you. Telling someone they are weak or pathetic because they need God is, in and of itself, a shitty thing to do.


People are people and need help along the way. If you don't need religion, fine; but if you do, fine.


Only pieces of shit judge people as to why they do good."
This is why I have said that a a Christian atheists are some of the best people I know. They do the right thing because it is the right thing to do and most of all they don’t judge people who have made mistakes.
"Oh look, it's one of those dumb opinions almost everyone agrees on, must be a good fit for the sub I guess.

"A particular religion only yields one moral code out of infinitely many. If you dont use religion to base your morals, then you use something else. It could be learned from your environment, from your schools, your parents, your friends, television, media, public figures, culture, society or one of the many philosophies that exist, but likely stemming from a combination of all of these plus more. You dont even know how and by what means you define your moral code. You just do. It's really no better or worse than basing it from religion. The only difference is that religion is organised, atheists dont have an organised religion, thus it follows that they have no organised moral code so it's difficult to identify the source of their morals. If someone says they're doing good for jesus, then that's no less moral than you saying you do it for your own culmination of other moral codes. You may think you're a free thinker because of it, and that you have this free will over how you choose to act but you have no clue. How is that superior? Tbh we're all just terrible people trying to be good people."

"This isn't an opinion,it's a FACT"
"I kindly disagree. *Usually* those people are miserable wimps which abuse ""a meaning of the Bible"" to hide that they wouldn´t do this in their whole lifetime. They want to feel powerful, but since they are to weak to show off, they´re doing the ""hold me back, HOLD ME BACK!!""

For example, I´ve been out late last week with my guys. A group of teens were calling after us, so we looked at them. Then they were calling us sons of bitches and that we should come at them. When we did they ran away like cowards. I assume they´ve expected us to run away or be afraid or something.

So in conclusion,those people are cowards and terrible people (but for another reason). In addition, this shouldn´t motivate anyone doing bad or extreme stuff, it should encourage shutting up when dumb words aren´t appropriate.

Edit: Words"
"Jordan Peterson pointed out that a good person is not one who merely does not commit immoral acts, as that links up those that are naive and incapable of harm. Instead, a good person is an individual that is not only capable of harm but directly desires it and is able to suppress it. I believe this is so regardless of the method, even if this requires the use of religion."
">what stops him from doing bad things if it isn't god.


Similarly, some people argue that it's impossible for religious people to be altruistic since all their good deeds are done at least in part to gain access to heaven or to please their God. Can't do something good that doesn't benefit you if EVERY good deed benefits you in an abstract way."

"This is a really good point because at the heart of Christianity is an understanding that we are not good people (or perhaps capable of both good and evil). So in some respects, yes you would be a terrible person without the (theoretically) life-changing (for the good) impact of God in your life.

But it's about transformation, so Christianity should see the humbling and healing of the inner person so they move to become a better person. But it's easy to allow our hearts to harden - and see a shift from inner transformation to attempts at outward conformity - which rightly leads to accusations of hypocrisy."

"I agree with this, if someone would kill someone but finds a framework that stops them from doing so, that is a good thing. The person who still kills someone is a terrible person, not the person who finds a way to stop themselves."
No no we need to call that guy a terrible person for not being a smart moral internet atheist.
">but that wasn't what Jesus was going for.

The Gospel of Thomas is the best Gospel I'll fight anyone who disagrees.  No miracles and bullshit made up after he died for the sake of ethos, just saying after saying of a rather brilliant moral philosopher"
"Is consistency a desirable trait though? I would think it's quite the opposite.

I actually think it highlights a huge flaw in the system, where in order to cope with changes in society, but hampered by an 'original' set of rules, religions are forced to either:

(a) try to create re-interpretations of the original statements and rules or

(b) dig their heels in and insist on the original interpretations, which invariably causes a certain amount of human suffering for X number of years, during which time there is a mismatch between the lifestyles of the devout and the less-significantly-devout, continuing on until something dramatic happens to force their hand into following method (a). Often the 'something dramatic' is actually just a group of people of the same religion who've taken it upon themselves to do method (a) and then have an argument with the (b) group until (a) wins some kind of majority.

Historically speaking I don't think this is an inaccurate representation of the difficulties religion has faced - you can say the rules have been consistent, but \*actually\* most religions have been switching up or down their interpretations of their texts in line with society for centuries, struggling with what to do (often, dare I say, holding back societal progress for a time) and eventually trying to back-justify things to fit in with the thoughts of the modern day."
"Morals should absolutely evolve over time.

The Bible has passages about how slaves should behave. If you hold a properly biblical moral standpoint, you would be alright with slavery.

If it's discovered that trees can feel pain, I will absolutely change my actions."
Keeping slaves was always morally wrong. Just because religion allowed society to weakly justify their actions of keeping literal humans against their wills doesn’t mean it was ever morally good. You’re confusing permissibility with morality.
"Right, murder the infidels, such a good message to keep through the ages"
">My point is that morals are relative. Who is to say that the actions we commit now won't be considered immoral in the future? Would that make you an immoral person?

Common sense and empathy let us make pretty good judgment on what is going to make progress, not superstitious beliefs and traditions."
"If you can't change your mind, you're not learning anything. I'd say this is a societal trait as well.

The world isn't about me, or you for that matter. If in 200 years my choices are judged by a bunch of people that can't frame history in context, what does that matter?"
The message is the problem though. Deuteronomy tells us that anyone who surrenders in war MUST be enslaved with the only exception being 6 tribes that are close competitors which must be destroyed. I don't know where this peace and loving meassage in the bible comes from because it isn't in the text.
"Actually, you're pretty wrong about that. There were religious justifications for almost all the horrible shit committed by people in the last 2,000 years. Americans used religion to justify slavery. Religion was the main factor in putting down the LGBT community. The church changes its stance on these issues when it becomes unpopular to have them, or when it's convenient for community leaders. 500 years ago, divorce was unthinkable. Then a king wanted one, so now half of marriages end in divorce. 10 years ago, the pope was a Nazi who was very against the LGBT community, while using his power to run an international ring of gay pedophiles and keep it quiet. Now, there's a new pope who's still covering up the pedophile ring, but he says gays are alright. Religion is made up and run by people. People are flawed scared animals who want something to hide behind. Organized religion is the crack-cocaine of moral ambiguity and most people get hooked early."
"Morals depend on your goals and which goals have priority over other goals. As time goes on, the goals stay pretty similar but these goals take turns having greater priority over each other as circumstances change and preferences change.

I think that explains a lot of why morality seems to change without reality every being different. Religious behavior is going to help solidify a particular hierarchy of values. Solidifying helps people navigate better but it also keeps people from changing with new knowledge and circumstances. So the, over all, equally important benefits from rigidity and flexibility take turns having priority over one another as people fluctuate finding themselves on one side or the other."
"> And most religious people know why you shouldn't do bad things, most will agree with me in saying it isn't out of fear of punishment either. 

True, most would say that. However, I'm not talking about them, but a specific, sizable group of people. Who in fact do think that way. 

I do agree with everything else you have said though."
"I think you're right about some of religious people, but wanted to point out we are not all the same.

As you said, many religious folk base their moral compass on prayer. I am one of those people. 

When I pray for moral guidance, I basically just sit down and think 'what is the right thing to do' and usually realise that I was doing the wrong thing. For example if I am fighting with my family and pray about it, I realise that I love them and should let the issue go. It's not like God talks to me or anything, I just start to see things from a different perspective.

My partner is not religious, but when she needs moral guidance she goes for a walk and thinks about what to do. She usually calms her nerves and realises what the right thing to do is through this process by changing perspective.

What is the difference between these two sources of moral guidance? Both are essentially introspection, trying to get in touch with yourself and your conscience. The only difference is that I believe that my conscience comes from God, while my partner believes it comes from her brain.

I don't blindly take guidance from scriptures (yes, the bible says that marriage is between a man and a woman, but my conscience says otherwise and I'm happy in my gay partnership) but you will no doubt meet many religious people who do. These folks tend to be a lot louder about their beliefs so you hear about them more, but they are by no means representative of all religious people."
"Here is the thing, atheist or not, humans have been shown to have an innate understanding of fairness. That makes sense, we really do what to treat others as we would be treated. There is a sense of fairness that you are born with.

Religion, and/or the lack thereof in my opinion just shapes that ""moral compass"" in both good ways and bad. I would say religion usually adds layers of complexity to the fairness for arbitrary reasons. Can't eat certain foods on certain days. Must pray at least x times a day. The list goes on and on. By adding arbitrary and sometimes contradictory beliefs, we have to start playing mental gymnastics just to try to reason about fairness.

An eye for an eye is fair game, except if it's tuesday afternoon, or the person is a slave, then there are a different set of rules. Check out George Carlin's bit on the 10 commandments and how they can be withered down to just a few basic simple concepts everyone can agree on. [Found it, the 10 commandments by George Carlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk81tUUhRig)"
">religious people base their morale compass on what their scripture says and what they hear through prayer

They *say* they do this, but what I've found to be true is that they have a morale compass independently and then they retroactively say it's based on their scripture and convince themselves that all of their morals are backed up by the bible in some way."
">The thing is that religious people base their morale compass on what their scripture says and what they hear through prayer. 

No, we don't.  It would be nice if one of these days atheists understood the very basics of what they're critiquing.

>Atheists are different because they have to build a moral code on what they personally feel is right or wrong.

Literally random feelings."
"If you're hearing things from praying please, see a therapist or a doctor."
"Man Reddit is really dumb. The morality of our entire society is built upon those the Abraham's faiths. Atheists are some special breed. Read some Dostoevsky. Or why Nietzsche said God is Dead. 

>Nietzsche recognized the crisis that this ""Death of God"" represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief. ""When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident ... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands.""[15] This is why in ""The Madman"", a passage which primarily addresses nontheists (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of values in the absence of a divine order.

Even Nietzsche was able to recognize the problem. It doesn't mean atheists are doomed-- but they're certainly not some special breed that evolved past morality."

"As a Christian you should now that conviction of wrong comes from the Holy Spirit, something that nonChristians don't have. There is no ""good person."" ""There is none righteous, not one."" Doing moral wrong is easy without the conviction. Many will say ""well I'm not feeling an urge to murder anyone so I don't need religion."" But this is a reductive viewpoint that misses there are much smaller wrongs that are much easier for the nonChristian to brush off."
Exactly.
Do people actually ask you that though?
"the ""reward/punishment"" system is used for 5 year olds who still haven't developed a moral compass, if you're an adult and have to rely on this system to act like a decent person then you have a big problem on your hands."
"The thing is though that if the reqards are good enough a lot of people are willing to bend.

Easiest example that came to mind is buying from chik fil a. Its a fucking fast food restaurant and there are many like it.

I think that's fair. I respect your differing opinion.
How is it edgy?
"You're basically showing your ignorance of Christianity here. The faith teaches that it isn't about ""rules"" and ""laws"", but about forgiveness and a relationship with God. The ten commandments weren't given with any expectation that we could follow them out of our own discipline. They were given to highlight that we *can't,* and need the daily practice of repentance (""pursuing inner work and change"") to become more Christ-like. What the faith calls 'sanctification'."
"I think that's a very superficial  and inaccurate interpretation of religion as a whole.

&#x200B;

if your understanding of religion is that of toddler level then that means that you only learned it at toddler level before you assumed you already knew everything and just stopped learning more about it.

&#x200B;

Firstly, different religions work differently so right off the bat your blanket statement is inaccurate, which religion are you talking about specifically? because the only thing all religions have in common is the element of faith, everything else tends to vary from morals to symbolism, for example I'm Buddhist and we don't have a god... or rather our Buddhism doesn't (there are many different branches of buddhism all of which vastly differ)

&#x200B;

I can see what you mean by what you said in that some people like to use religion as an excuse to void themselves of the responsibility of life, that way if something goes wrong they feel like they have someone other than themeselves to blame... your car broke down? well then it must be God's will! instead of ""well you should have had that checkup 3 months ago that you decided to skimp out on"" or simply "" you didn't do anything wrong but well, shitty things happen, deal with it""

&#x200B;

Others also see it as an opportunity to seize power over other people.

&#x200B;

Nonetheless I think that your approach is quite superficial and naive, every system has people who abuse it for their own benefit and just because that happens doesn't mean you should go around assuming that is the system's purpose.

&#x200B;

Everyday I see people abuse religion but I also see people use it as a tool for pursuing inner change and improving as a person, not because ""God says so"" but because its what they genuinely want for themselves and they feel like the religion and community helps them achieve that goal.

&#x200B;

I would suggest that you look more in-depth into the religions of this world and their communities, not because I want you to convert or some crap like that, you do you, if what you do works for you then good, I'm happy for you, that's all that matters, but I think its important to study these things that are a part of your world to at least understand them at a more than superficial level."
It called the human rights charter and properly trained law enforcement.
"Nice strawman. I didn't say that people shouldn't be religious. I *said* your moral compass shouldn't entire based upon religion, and that your beliefs should be organic. In the sense, that you at the very least question your own religious beliefs, and think for yourself in terms of morality.

"Personally, I wasn't not aware that this was an popular opinion, until after people told. Oh well, fair enough I suppose."
"One that is logical in nature, considers the well being of the other person, and society as a whole. At least to my knowledge this makes the most sense to me. However, I think that this is a nuanced topic, and leaves much to be discussed.

I however, don't really have a definitive answer to this question."
"True, but some people are the other way around. In which they say they aren't going to do something awful because of their religious belief; not because it's wrong."
Nice bait
"Why are you getting downvoted? It's true.. Some people can't handle it, I guess."
"So there is also the bleak hypothesis, that states that this is true for everyone. Essentially, every good deed you do does benefit you in some way, and therefore, ever deed you do is im fact a selfish act, and it is impossible to be purely altruistic. 

The hypothesis hinges on the idea though, that if am action benefits you, that makes it selfish. Im not sure I would totally agree with that premise. 

Also, i think most people believe that what makes an action altruistic is the motivation behind it, so that if you do a good thing, with bad motivations, its not altruistic. However, i dont know anyone who can choose their emotions, or their desires, if someone could do that, they could just always choose to be happy and have good desires. However, people (for the most part), have the ability to choose their actions, despite their desires. So say i desired to keep all my money for myself, BUT, i believed it was good to give to others who don't have as much as myself, i could act on that belief DESPITE my desire to keep all my money. 

So the conversation is a bit more nuanced. Also, which is better, a person who never does a good act, because they are not able to perform one that is purely altruistic, or a person who helps a ton of people out of selfish desire? Is it someones motivations that make them a ""good"" person, or is it their actions? Someone with good motivations that never acts? Or someone with bad motivations who acts despite them? 

Great topic and gets more interesting the deeper you dive."
"I wanna do good things and bring happiness to people and THEN go to hell just to spite the system. And I want to fight demons in hell, and when god says that I can go to heaven now because of my deeds in hell I'll say: ""Nah, I'm making my own heaven down here."" :D

"That being said people will only do good things if they want to. The only reason people want to is because it makes them happy. Donate a shit tone of money to charity?

Brilliant system to trick folks into acting altruistic though.  Americans still donate more of their income to charity than anyone else.

That's the same message as the Bible story of the widow's mite.
"That makes sense. An average person donating $1,000 to something they believe in is a more genuine donation than some billionaire who gives $100,000 to the same charity. But, all the time we hear about these ""huge"" donations from billionaires, when in reality it actually saves them from paying taxes. I don't want to hear about a billionaire making a donation unless it's half his net worth. Realistically, nobody would hear about a donation of half my net worth except the people receiving it."

"The term for this idea is Total Depravity. The Catholic/Atheist/Agnostic types might know it by its more common usage: Original Sin. 

Essentially, humanity is born into sin and is incapable (not unwilling, totally incapable) of reconciliation to God because of this. There's a verse that says that our best efforts at doing good are to God as filthy rags (the usage in the original language refers to menstrual garments. Essentially, a dirty tampon).

From there, it's a focus on God's transformation of the heart and salvation of each of the Elect, that is, those God chooses to transform and deliver out of their Total Depravity, through no action on the individual's part.

There's a quote by a famous theologian which says ""I believe in the doctrine of Election, because without God choosing me, I certainly would have not chosen Him"".

"The point of that is if I'm a Christian, I'm supposed to be Christlike in everything I do. If I am a slave, I should be Christlike in that. The rest of the passage shows this. It isn't saying that slavery is good."
"That's fair enough. I would guess that group is very small but I imagine it does exist. 

The sad thing is that a small amount of people approach Christianity with a spirit of legalism and rules rather than that of grace and love like what the Bible says to do. It becomes a rulebook rather than a relationship with God.

I can't really speak for any other religion, but it really breaks my heart when I see it in Christians."
Here's a scary thought for you then. What if those people DIDN'T have decent morals dictated to them through their religion?
"With that remark I don't get your opinion. 
If we divide people in groups, the one that will not harm people (or do bad stuff in general), and those who will. 
The religious morale do not affect the first class as the rules are in accordance with their personal actions. Indeed following religion will not drive you away from doing bad stuff if you don't intend to.
But about the second group that becomes important. If you don't believe in religious and it's rules then what drives you away from doing bad stuff ? 
When you are following religious rules, then it's an additional reason not to harm people. You might want to harm people but thanks to your religious environment you refuse to do so.

So if I get it right, having religious belief actually helps you be a better person.

Not even mentioning that religious morale did directly influence what a ""humanist"" morale is."

"Hi, I should've specified that I was talking about religions where worship is primarily used as a measure of being good. I understand that not all spiritualities are practiced in the same way. I was thinking of the Abrahamic religions writing my comment.

I think religions have *a* value in them. I firmly believe most modern religions draw from philosophies older than they are. Philosophy is excellent to have and critical for being spiritually healthy.

But I find that any worshipping aspect of the religion becomes easily corruptible and can be interpreted in many ways. It's too easy to define your actions as good or bad based on what the entity does or doesn't like, and what the entity does or doesn't like can be easily manipulated or misconstrued.

I've seen people help themselves through religion, sure, but for all of them it all boiled down to what God said was good. They're doing it for God. Even if it's positive there's no free thinking."
"No I understood, I’m saying why are you telling people to question the only thing that helps them keep a moral compass?

Best to not go around making sweeping theological statements about one of the more controversial points of the largest organized religion on earth like all however many billion people in it actually believe the same thing."
The Catholic faith seems to think differently.
"This is literally no true scotsmanning a doctrinal debate that’s spanned centuries. Are Catholics not true Christians? Orthodox? Both require the unity of faith and good works. Even Methodists require your faith to be sanctified, demonstrated through good works. 

> after a man is saved and has genuine faith, his works are important if he is to keep justified. James 2:20-22, ""But wilt thou known, O vain main, that faith without (apart from) works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou faith wrought with works, and by works was faith made perfect?

The above is literally from one of the seminal texts for Methodist seminary students. It’s not like there isn’t biblical and textual evidence for this as well:

>God who will render to every man according to his deeds: To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.

Romans. I’m not religious anymore, but I read my bible enough to be salty when people start throwing around true Christian talk. There’s so many different ways to interpret the text it seems to me the height of arrogance to claim true understanding, especially given when even as a non religious person, the history behind the writings and their origins is an extraordinarily vast and complex tapestry of many different actors of different origins, beliefs, and motivations."

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn sums this up for me very well: ""The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either – but right through every human heart…even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains…an uprooted small corner of evil."""
Total depravity has little to nothing to do with doctrine of Original Sin.  Original sin is literally that.  It's the first sin.  Total depravity is the belief that sin itself has so altered our nature that we are then incapable of knowing what Goodness is.  It was anathematized very early on in the Church.
"A hardening of the heart is a concept in the bible that effectively contrasts to a soft heart. A soft heart is one capable of humility, empathy, kindness etc. Hardness of heart would be where you become cold and uncaring in regards to yours and others circumstances.

So a Christian (or I guess anyone) who allows their hearts to harden would be someone who doesn't care for others. Is perhaps more concerned with being 'right' always than being loving. etc etc.

Hope that helps clarify my point!"
"effectively, yeah."
For some people I imagine it is. I realize that if I were to go out and kill another human that entitles others to have the freedom to kill me. That and I don't think I would derive pleasure or any positive emotion from killing another.
"Eh, most religions were(or even still are) very expansionist and intollerant of other believes. Most originated with some form or the other of 'convince everyone to join and murder the heretics/infidels/etc'

Obviously that part is gone now in manx religions, but it was and still is in some a core part of the religious spirit"
"Ok, but the spirit of religion is incredibly hostile to everybody outside of a particular set of beliefs to the point that it's militant. It drives racism, homophobia and prevents scientific and social progress."
"Excuse me, single parent families do not invariably  lead to instability and violence, there are plenty of two parent families that are incompetent and lead to (instability and violence)"
"THIS. The thing about the scripture is that it can be used to justify almost any action, even if it's not moral. You can easily find justification for slavery, homophobia, oppression of women etc. The Bible isn't a reliable book to base your morals on"
"Not sure if I understand you right, but for what it's worth there is another religious context involved. When I'm praying it is self reflection but with a religious motive - my faith is that God wants us to treat others with love, so I am thinking and seeking the most loving way to act. So it's kinda religiously informed, I step back from my thoughts and think 'is this the most loving action'."

Hey! We’re in the same boat. Sort of...
Oh okay then sir. Continue on your day.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Shacklefords attorney, Rusty Shackleford. My client pleads insanity."
"Yea, thats more or less what I believe, especially when you look back in history at how many people were pedophiles openly marrying 13 year olds.

Heck there are places on earth right now where that shit still happens with regularity. We ignore it because its unpleasant to think about."
"""Depraved"" as in the original meaning of the word: Morally corrupt. Christians believe that even though we all know the basics of Right and Wrong, we often (some more than others) choose to do the wrong thing. It sounds harsh on the surface but we acknowledge that we were in the same boat morally. And even though we acknowledge that only God can truly transform our hearts, we're still not perfect and we're in the process of changing."
"I would say that there are a handful of 'great levellers' in Christian thought (i.e. things that effectively make us all equal). Perhaps surprisingly Sin can be considered one of these, and perhaps particularity important in the context of this discussion. Christians are neither less sinful, nor morally superior, to anyone else - because they experience sin (or our capacity for evil to use a less theological terminology) as much as anyone else.

If there is a difference it would be in their receiving forgiveness for this sin/evil which has brought (or even bought) them into the Christian faith. The equal availability of God's grace to all as it happens is another of these 'great levellers' that exist within the faith."
"So being saved doesn't make Christians incapable of evil. The Regeneration of the Heart just gives people who would otherwise be totally depraved the ability to not choose evil in a world filled with evil and to be able to choose God back after He first chooses us. It doesn't eliminate the temptation of evil, nor does it render them any more valuable in God's eyes than those who are not saved. ""God wills that none should perish"", but I don't know why the mechanics of the universe do not allow God to save all of humanity.

But, yes, ""those who do not believe on the Son shall not see God"", among other verses on Hell and what happens after. The idea that many will be condemned and are separated from God strikes every Christian to his core and is something we all wrestle with, but it also impresses on Christians the need to tell people about the Good News of Jesus Christ, that more of those ""predestined to become Children of God"" will be saved."
"My Bible study just completed a series on Calvinism, Predestination and this whole bit. It reframed my Christianity into terms that made sense and portrayed Christ's death and the regeneration of the Elect as more of a miracle than I ever understood before.

Fully understanding this makes me excited to be a Christian, because it successfully articulates what I know to be true: That I was a sinner and hopeless to save myself, but God had mercy on me and saved me without my participation or choice, because if there would be a way to ""screw up salvation"", I would find it. But I have been saved from myself, and there is no way to do that.

I'd never heard that Solzhenitsyn quote before, but it's pretty powerful. He is such a triumph of the Spirit. Thank you for that."
That doesn't contradict with what I said though. Also even without being religious we behave like that anyway. We find new things to worship and kill off each other in ideological wars. Maybe this thing runs deeper than the institutions and has something to do with the nature of humanity itself.
I doubt you've read it
Perhaps - but what document or book does when it gets quoted out of context?
"I think you missed the point.

He's saying, as far as I can tell, that some people need to have the threat of eternal hellfire to not rape, rob and murder, and while the Bible may be outdated in terms of things like sodomy, homosexuality and eating certain foods, it certainly does contain a mostly decent moral code."
Yup.
"I've never quite known where to land on the extent to which Predestination governs our lives; namely what it means for those 'non-elect' and this interplay with free will.

That said, I agree wholeheartedly that salvation is God's gift to us and not earned by our own achievements. Grace is an amazing thing!

And yes, that  Solzhenitsyn quote is such an effectively articulation of our state of being - and one of the best outside of scripture that I know. I recognises that however good we are we are never truly perfect, nor however bad we are that we are not capable of change for good."
You say this like there's an objective agreed upon context when the fact that there actually isn't is why Christianity has so many sects.

"For everything else, there's MainCard."
"Oh yes, I've finally got my Main's degree!"
A lot of serial communication protocols like i²C have this too.
"But Master has other connotations than slavemasters, right? Master & Apprentice, for example.

Edit for Clarification: I know the pairing in tech is specifically Master/Slave. My point in this comment was more to bring attention to alternatives like renaming the ""Slave"" part of the duality and keeping the widely standardized ""Master"". But I'm personally fine with the current change as well, as long as the language used is descriptive of the function. ""Main"" is perfectly fine, I have seen that being used in projects before.

Well sometime early this year we update the program and now it’s called “deadline worker”. We had a laugh because obviously the role of these machines aren’t any different so we started calling it “deadline indentured servant” or “deadline unpaid intern”"

How the fuck would this work without fucking up your repo.

Fuck Microsoft and their shitty politically correct decisions."
Petition to remove #000000 and #fffffff
"2020 is the year that mostly white people on a righteous quest to rid themselves of their original sin decided that the fight for racial equality will mostly be about symbolic, ultimately meaningless gestures.

I remember how 20 years ago the civil rights movement was mostly about affirmative action, forced desegregation and reparations for descendants of former slaves and not about whether using the term negro or having the statue of a racist philanthropist is offensive or not. You can have an opinion on these matters, we all do. They often differ wildly even for entirely valid reasons. Nowadays however, there's hardly any public discourse about public policy, which would actually shape the future of young minorities. It's all about statues and words, policing behaviour to a minute detail and virtue signalling.

Being white, I'm not going to criticize the direction minorities choose to fight their battles, but I do hear a lot of minority leaders airing the anger over these issues and I deeply sympathize. I didn't invent the above reasoning, I chose to listen to some people who know a lot more about these matters than I do. 

If I look at the bottom line, I don't think it matters that much if the main is no longer called master. To me, it's a minor inconvenience at most. What does bother me about it is that I feel that this is a distraction which doesn't help all those kids in disadvantaged households, in whose name this whole movement operates. Because we realised that fixing the actual problem is hard, we're focusing on those which are easy."

Master-senpai makes no sense. Senpai-kouhai is more accurate.
Or maybe people could spend their time solving real problems like actually understanding why people feel marginalized rather than changing terms to make themselves feel good.

"Okay, I don't want to pick a fight but if someone could educate me that would be awesome.

I don't see where the problem is in the aforementioned scenario. The clutch (or brake) slave cylinder is so called because it serves the master cylinder, hence the master / slave relationship. Similarly, a master USB cable to an external harddrive carries data and power, and a slave cable serves it by carrying extra power required to spin the drive.

I can see how someone could get offended if I called a person ""slave"", particularly if they had dark skin, but these objects share a master / slave relationship *by definition*. One serves the other. It's not inherently racist that my car has a large cylinder and a smaller assisting cylinder. That's just how words work, no? I'm not hurting anyone or talking down on anyone by referring to an inanimate component as a ""Master"" or ""slave"" component.

By the same logic, would it not be bad if I tell people I drive a black car? Or am typing this on a black phone?"
I rather wish my little brother had a slave degree. And I could keep my master.

Absolutely. Hard working group.
"Can confirm. However in a play you don't call each other ""Dom"" or ""Sub"". Whatever flies your boat, but ""master"" and ""slave"" are classic words to address each other during play.

But like you said: the BDSM community has to be woke, because they're dealing with a lot of difficult topics. Handling consent of dealing pain, humiliation, injury, etc. is only possible when you are very aware of which words and actions do what to whom."
Yeah but sub and slave kinda means different things in BDSM tho
Anybody who is still moving is reeeally taking their time. But isn't `trunk` the same concept in Subversion that master is in Git?
"I mean, that makes much more sense, given the extended metaphor you get when taking branches from the trunk (merging back into the trunk makes that weird though)."
That sounds like good UX anyway.

Allowlist sounds like something a kindergarden teacher came up with as some kind of educational measure.

""Good job cleaning your shelf Timmy, you're going on the allowlist for icecream!"""
When I first got into computers/servers I confused the two for a while. Allowed list and blocked or ban list seems more logical why was black white list used in first place seems stupid.
To be clear: blacklist is blocklist and whitelist is allowlist

"I actually got embroiled in a project where this came up and we went with ""Block / Safe"" list. I never imagined having to debate this in requirements when I got into tech 15 years ago."
What about blackbox and whitebox testing? These terms are used because it's easy shorthand versus a more descriptive (and wordier) term. Neither one has any positive or negative connotation associated with color - the black and white refer to the transparency of/access to the code to the tester.
In which case “masterwork” should be the name used. Sounds cooler too.

But it's not a personal decision; this is a decision that impacts nearly every programmer.

"They’d probably argue that marginalization is a complex problem, and that changing language to avoid unnecessary use of loaded terms is part of how you fix it.

"> A blackboard is actually black.


Our boards in school were always *green*, but I'd still probably use the word ""blackboard"" to describe it in English, as a ""whiteboard"" is made of a different material."
">>Will we rename Blackboards and Whiteboards as well?

>A blackboard is actually black. There is no negative connotation to it being black. 

Except when it's green. But at least the whiteboard is white (right?) 

>>Is Red List okay

>Probably. After all, red and green are pretty universal visual language

Except in China where red is good (because communism) and so by contrast green must be bad.

I don't exactly disagree with your point, but it's a big world and universal rules are difficult."
"""Sperrliste""  is least not so common for me. Neither is the term ""Schwarze Liste"". I think the most used term at work when talking is ""Blocklist"" or ""Blacklist"". 

I just wanted to point out that the term blacklist isn't an exclusive english idiom.

I'm aware that words phase out, but in some cases I can't help to think that the racist connotation is somehow constructed, similar to the Dallas County ""black hole"" story."
">	Isn’t Sperrliste equally common?

No. Never heard this one before. It seems also a bit more specific than what you can express with “Schwarze Liste”. But granted: the use of “Schwarze Liste” happens mostly in a colloquial context. For the technical terms we often tend to adopt the Anglo American expressions like “Blacklist”.

>	Since you speak German, you’re no stranger to certain innocuous words falling out of fashion. This language is a minefield of words and idioms you shouldn’t use post-1945. We’ve been phasing words out for a long time.

While I agree that there has to be an awareness towards the implications of language, German is not a “minefield of words and idioms you shouldn’t use post-1945”
Most of these words and idioms were never innocent to begin with but rather forcefully and deliberately implemented into the German language as a language of the third reich. (cf. Victor Klemperer: Lingua Tertii Imperii) The use of them was mostly (but unfortunately not completely) discontinued after the fall of the third reich.
And those who were initially innocent but then misused by the nazis, are still used but are now highly dependent on the context.

I can’t think of any inherently innocent words that were or should be phased out just because of a changing political perception.
Same with “Blacklist”. For me the word is just settling on the bigger concept of “black vs. white”. This concept itself has nothing to do with race but is probably as old as mankind, because it derives from light and the absence of light. And people tend to like light.
“Phasing out” the linguistic reflections of this concept because black, no matter the context, “musn’t be perceived as negative at all costs” is just tokenism."
"Color isn't always associated with people though. It's kinda pointless to ""fix"" the meaning in all cases"
"I'm sorry but this is just so idiotic. The usual ""negative, dark"" connotations with the colour black and the ""pure, good"" connotations with the colour white have literally nothing to do with race."
"I believe its very universal in Europe. In Denmark it's called ""strømafbrydelse"", directly translated to power interruption."
"Which from a UX standpoint also makes more sense. (Blackout’s fine, too, but this makes *even more* sense, w/o being verbose)"
"in the us thatd imply someone cut the power

we also use ""power outage"" in the usa"
Then what's a rolling blackout?
"Outside of a dog man's best friend is a book. Inside of a dog it's too photon deficient to read.

Yep, still works."
It's still called that at noon.
"It's also the word I use when telling foreign bar guests they're no longer welcome (happened once, luckily)"
Oh my God that's *even better*
"""Liste blanche"" et ""liste rouge"" (red list) in French, though I've seen ""liste noire"" used as well."
"They were usually called ""chalkboards"" where I am from."
"I once read a story about a company needing to redesign their packaging for the Indonesian (or maybe Vietnam) market. They thought green was a calming color, but it's considered a dangerous color by people living near a rainforest full of man-eating tigers."
"chinese people consider red to be lucky, not because of communism. Red was regarded as lucky way before communism ever existed in china.

Green isnt even considered bad either. This is evident in all the jade you can see in east asian art."
its entirely pointless also acting like black people were the only slaves is an insult to every other enslaved person
"In chess, black will now go first."
"I agree. I wholeheartedly support the BLM movement but this is getting absurd.

Next thing they wil say is we should rewire our genes so we aren't scared of the dark anymore because the dark is black and thus it's racist to be afraid of the dark."
"Yea, same in Germany. Stromausfall = power interruption."
"In german it's ""Stromausfall"" which is similar."
Power cut sounds like your power was intentionally cut off.

It's when you do a barrel roll
"It's pretty clear to me that the word ""blackout"" has no negative connotations, and a somewhat clear relationship to the real world. On the other hand, ""white = allowed, black = blocked"" has a slightly inconvenient connotation.

Inching away from such terms isn't terribly demanding. We've done it an awful lot in the last century and we can keep doing it."
UwUCard
I've always called it a power outage in canada...
"I think (here in the UK) we'd describe that as being shut off.

EDIT: or turned off."
Oof
"Blacklist = crossed out/covered in ink

Whitelist = not crossed out/covered in ink

Also straightforward, no?

At a certain point the inching away is just dumb."
"Sure, it has a negative connotation if you start suggesting it has a negative connotation"

"Escherian Stairwell in Minecraft.
I think that is how you spell it."
"How do you make the tp so seamless? ~ xx ~ never seems to work properly for me, it's always off by one on X or Z

Edit: solved by u/The_Slad"
Damn good job that teleportation is completely seamless
What happens if u go up the stairs
"But that other guy isn't a real player, or is he? I saw a guy make a player do stuff like that with commands once."
To be fair you need some brains to figure out how command blocks work
Antichamber vibes
"At exactly 11 seconds, you can see the other guy getting teleported upwards, very very briefly. Other than that, I'm impressed with how well you timed yourself walking down/up and watching the other guy without giving away what's happening. Well done!"

SCP-087 anyone?
My brain is melting from this

It’s like that scp area that’s a super  long staircase with a ghost haunting it
"I like to think that there are no command blocks, just a really long stairway and a bunch of different people"
"/execute testfor player [x y z] run tp @p [x y z] 
Is this the right command"
"How u did that, that the commands don’t appear in chat"
"Oh, this troll again"
you are hurting me
\*My brain trembles\*
Lol these stairs look very similar to the warehouse ones in scrap mechanic
So how r u gettin out..?
Looks like someone's been interested in the Escherian Stairwell
"Hey wait, Captain Disillusion already debunked this stairwell, nice try!"
Nice

My brain hurts
No no no no no no no no waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa not the escherian stairwell
Smol brain i dont get it
Is this supposed to be that staircase in that school that supposedly looped.
Here we are in the escherian stairwell.
"Wouldn't you still be able to see the ""seam"" where the teleportation occurs though? If one player is observing another player passing the seam, it would be blatantly obvious what is happening."
Reminds me of when i stopped time to move a french man down the stairs
Or you could have like thirty friends and a big staircase
This looks like my acid trip
Non euclidean worlds type beat
"How does this teleportation work, without any transition?"
I can hear the endless staircase music
"Very dope, and similar to a mod/data pack that can let you create hallways and rooms overlap.

you make a funcional  SCP-087
How do you made it so smoothly?
How do you make the tp transition so smooth?
You created Penrose stairs in minecraft!
The scp foundation would like to know your location
"I just hope that dude is a friend, and not a clone made also with the command block"
This must be the power of ZA WARUDO!
I remember when i used to expirement on command blocks just after they got added. Not my thing now. I mostly play survival and when i finish everything i want i will move to ftb again.
This hurts my pp
What Version Is This?
No..... Not again
Seamless
no
yes
"Explain, please."
stairs at school be like
how is it so seamless!? I tried this a while back and you could see the teleportation happen on screen. like bruh

u/captainsparklez this map seems like it could be really interesting. You should give it a shot
Can you notify me when you do it? Thanks!
It teleports them back when reaching a certain point. Its just 2 staircases
I was just about to say
[SCP-087](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-087)
That was the first thing I though of as well.
I have no idea what it is but the amount of SCP references I've seen the past week is staggeringly high
so im nkt the only one who thought of this
Captain Disillusion’s video on the Escherian Stairwell is so well made.
"Put .0 on the end of the tp coords. Instead of tp @p ~10 ~3 ~20, you do tp @p ~10.0 ~3.0 ~20.0"
you need to use all relative coords.
You will be teleported downwards
"execute as \^@a\[scores={teleportUpwards=1..}\] at \^@s run tp \^@s\[scores={teleportUpwards=1..}\] \~ \~10 \~

Scoreboard objective is assigned to players in certain area of the staircase, and is then reset."
That's what I'm thinking and I hate it but love it.
"r doesn't work anymore, he probably used \^@a\[distance=..3\] in an execute as at command, then teleported them up a few blocks."
"Basically:



















*you don't*"
Teleporting to the top staircase when you reach the bottom and vice versa
How do you get it to do that without pressure plates
" 
no, this is wrong.
you need to align the player exactly to the same location but lower or higher or stuff, so /tp @s ~ ~10 ~ for example"
I expected a rick roll
Hello captain
The timings of it is pretty flawless I have to say
Ok but how does it work irl?
That's one of my favorite
Yeah me too
Hero!
"you can do that using one command block,but execute commands usually lag my worlds, I have a lot of creations maybe I'll turn.some off"
"..bruh, ok"
Repeating command block that checks if a player with a certain score object is near (you can specify the range)
"Rick rolls are stupid and unfunny. Something like goatse or meatspin has a punitive element that creates the humor. The joke, the part that's funny, is that you made someone look at something that they didn't want to see. Rick rolling doesn't have a joke. It's a placeholder where a joke used to be when the joke was removed for being nsfw."
Probably a command block at the bottom of the stair case that detects players from a certain distance like @a[distance=..1] and then at their position teleport them up with relative coordinates. At least that is the way I did my infinite bookshelf hall.
"It doesn't, it only works in Minecraft."
How do you specify range
I agree Rick Rolls are stupid and un funny. We need to link people to [this](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) instead.
damn someone must’ve really rick rolled you BAD for you to be this salty about it
I can assure you that there are a lot of people who find it funny. You're just not one of thm
```` Testfor @a[r=2]```` hooked up to a comparator with a command block saying ````Tp @p [insert coordinates]````
[https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/7r2a70/113\_testfor\_equivalent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/7r2a70/113_testfor_equivalent/)
Bruh don’t downvote this guy it is okay to ask for command help. Remember your first day learning commands “experts”
Well played
"Slotting in the most predictable possible thing to say is exactly the opposite of how humor works. What's the punchline, where's the twist?"
If you are using a version prior to 1.13 you can't use testfor but you can use execute instead like this /execute at @a[distance=..1] run tp ~ ~offset ~
"Everyone is so high and mighty these days, it’s annoying. Then they say look it up when your in a place with like minded individuals who could explain it to you."
"that’s fine, I just find it funny how strong of an opinion you have on a *meme* of all things lol"
He was talking to people downvoting you. He was saying it's a safe place to ask these kinds of questions. :)
i mean it's funny sometimes but especially when you're trying to find info it's just annoying

Yes. This comic is 100% literal.
"The umbrella is not shrinking, the other plant is growing bigger and stronger."
Seems apt to me

Makes a change from their usual stalking though.

Darmok and Jalad on the ocean.

"really, its to not forget what happened how are you so dense that you dont understand that the UNION allowed them to exist...they are still apart of our history no matter how bad it is. when we forget about gen lee we forget about the horric things the south stood for. its not to glorify its a reminder of how far from the path we can stray. cutting those down doesnt do anything but allow that sentiment to arise again. we were ALL taught this is school for crying out loud. idgaf about the confederate flag but i do care about the moments in history that solidified the us and remind everyone why the republicans fought so hard to end slavery and even helping to find escaped slaves to get them to the north. Those are reminders of what happened in those states to tell everyone never again. Dont forget that it was people that thomas jefferson that went out of there way to try and stop the mulism slave trade. if you want to get mad about slaves look at the arab world. look at places like sudan those places still have open slavery and modern slavery. Yes when you start with those statues where does it end? not the abolitionist Matthias Baldwin that paid out of pocket to fund and pay teachers at a black school or thomas jefferson who fought the slave trade...where does it end since you dont even understand the point of keeping those images...its like you dont even like being an american."
"I think when statues of Christopher Columbus are being torn down and a  church in America is burned, saying rioters are 'destroying history' is a valid complaint.

I do.
Must throw away all the umbrellas.
What's your interpretation of the comic?
Oh ohhhhh
Yeah I had a brain fart that ones on me
You can buy clothes there
Is soup a beverage?
You stopped your post in the middle of a sentence. I finished it - absurdly.
That’s not what the comic is about
"There's nothing stopping schools from teaching about them, just like how German schools teach about the Nazis. You don't need to see reminders of them in society every day to know what they were about."
"The San Miguel mission burned down? When did this happen? Because it looks to me like it's still standing.

And why are you so attached to statues of a genocidal pedophile? They should be torn down, just like how all the Nazi symbols were removed from German society."
I do too
I do too
Yeah I'll keep this comic in mind in case I ever become a flower xD
"Broadly: good intentions can have poor results

Specific to overprotective parenting: sheltering your kids too much will cause them to have a rough time later in life"
"Wanting to protect something so much that you smother it's growth. For children this usually means you keep them away from any experience that could have a negative outcome, thus not allowing them to create the natural emotional/social/physical tolerances that other children get at developmental stages."
"It's a metaphor. Challenges help us grow. Protecting a child from all challenges and discomfort will deny them what they need to grow, and they will wither especially compared to those around them.

Since the whole thing is a metaphor, don't try to take any one piece too literally. A flower ""protected"" from the rain will literally wither and die, but children ""protected"" from life don't slowly turn into baby Voldemort. Remember, metaphor."
"""If you use an umbrella you're gonna fuckin' die."""
WHY ARE YOU BUYING CLOTHES AT THE SOUP STORE!?
Is tea a soup?
Ok...
oh yeah also...if you want them gone then vote. you know use your rights. tearing down public property is not covered by the 1st destroying property is not peaceful. Maybe you do. if you look at places that used iconoclast tactics and destroyed the historical landmarks of those countries always end up the same as the regime before or worse. but still if you dont like...vote in local elections. people did that and got some removed. cant argue with that since thats what the whole point of self governance is. our democracy works at a local level. Again when you tear down these things forcefully you embolden those people youre fighting. Do it right and vote. People dont vote which is a problem. you want better police vote for better representatives. they are the ones that can make those changes happen. way faster than any president can. so yeah learn your rights and use them efficiently and you would be surprised the changes you can make.
"I understand the desire to 'cancel' Christopher Columbus, I really do. He was a horrible man. That said, this dichotomy of him either being a genius hero that discovered America or 15th lucky idiot Hitler are both gross oversimplifications.

I don't think we should build modern statues to him, Hitler or no, but statues that are over 100 years old are artifacts and should be preserved. Contextualized perhaps, but preserved, and kept in public view. History shouldn't be caged in museums."
I thought it was: harm your rivals and disguise your true intentions as good deeds
"It applys to that fancy kitchen knife you don't use because you may dull or scratch it, or a new pick up truck you won't use because you might get a scratch. A teacup one doesn't use for fear of breaking is just a knickknack and has lost its function."
DON'T YELL AT ME
Is mayonnaise a soup?
Is milk soup?
And now you changed helpful to useful but still didn't finish the sentence? Ok...
"Berlin definitely enabled communists when they tore down the wall, and is surely a third world hellhole today."
"Agreed. Destroying those statues hides a part of western history that must be ackowledged: that we praised white men that helped the development of colonialism. This can't be just blown away by taking down material symbols. We should, however, contextualize like so those historical artifacts."
"The comic is titled ""hyperprotection. Pretty sure it is about parenting, and not very subtle at that."
"Ah, narcissistic parents."
is this a joke/reference i'm not getting ?
"I dont speak English very well, dude"
What are you trying to achieve here? Who cares if they missed out a full stop.
"Ah, OK. Now I get it. The way you originally wrote it, it genuinely looked like you just forgot to finish your sentence. I was expecting something along the lines of ""My friend, when his very helpful ... mother tries to take care of him,"" or similar. Now it's clear why you didn't appreciate my humor ;). For the record, I was trying to make fun of your apparent forgetfulness, not your grammar. If I had thought it was a grammar/foreign language issue, I wouldn't have mentioned it."
"It wasn't about that at all. OP edited their post several times. Originally it read ""My friend, when his VERY helpful"". Which led me to ask, ""his very helpful what?"". I didn't realize they meant ""My friend, when he's very helpful,"". I assumed that they forgot to finish their sentence. E.g. ""My friend, when his very helpful...mother tries to take care of him."" So, to answer your question, I was trying to achieve getting OP to finish their sentence to satisfy my curiosity about their friend's situation."
"I thouth I said ""he's"" right. Thanks"
"Ok, dude)"

When an uncommon skin looks better than an epic
"Necrosis is the only event skin I dropped real money on and I honestly dont regret it, plus any time I select Caustic on the legend screen randoms go :o"
"Jesus Christ, it's his final form"
"Caustic has the best skins in every event.

Claustic from shadowfall

Necrosis from system override

Season 2 lvl 25 skin princess skin

Plus his legendary skins are also so good along with the recolors."
Wait until he mega evolves
Started playing again recently...what is the middle skin?
i thought he started to lose weight... actually he became a robot
r/apexoutlands
Yes
Niiiiiice!
The legendary skin is kinda creepy.
Damn it’s only one king tho
I prefer the epic skin to the battle pass skin
hey a meme with the best kanto starter
Last one remind me of Vay Hek
"Some skins are worth the crafting metals
Some are not

But i dont understand why people need to have a gold skin on their Main

Why"
"Yes, you are."
"""Caustic used poisonpower!""

It's super effective!"
Damn I kinda which we had level up skins. I really like them.
That maybe one of the Jurassic Park welcome center
"Yes, you are the only one! haha

&#x200B;

haha

fucking

HAHA

HA HA  
H A H A

&#x200B;

fucking hell"
Lmao
That legendary skin is my favourite skin for any character in the game and I am so sad I didn’t get it.
"Am American, this is with him."
yeah.....
Yes you are
Unpopular opinion; that legendary skin is fucking hideous.
"Cyber sludge is by far Caustics ugliest skin, maybe even one of the ugliest in the game"
There are quite a few of these in the game.
"That legend skin though, so cool. But not 18 dollars cool."
"The thing is. Event(and bp) skins in general are just better.

Epic skins are *only* good if an event since base epics are just a generic color with some animated digital psrt to it. While event skins will have actual designs to them. And if epic, then a design plus animated digital part.

Also I'm aware the rare skin here is a BP skin but it falls in line with the cyborg event we had"
"When every uncommon skin is better than an epic.  

Ever been fighting an enemy with an epic skin in dark tunnel or room?  They light up like a fucking Christmas tree.  All other skins are dark and harder to see, but epic legend skins actually put you at a disadvantage in any darker areas of the map."
"Nah, the uncommon looks awful. Painfully bright lime green and the hair look completely out of place."
agree
It’s the event and BP Uncommons that look good.
"This started happening in season 4 mostly, The skins got better honestly."
Imo the stock Loba skin and the recollorings are better than the legendaries
"Let's be honest, all epic skins look horrible, and people that use them do so only because they either got them for free or want to look as flashy as possible."
yeah that's one of the best skins and caustic's best skins
"i've got the wraith from season 03 event and everyone compliments it, imo the best wraith skin by far and one of the best in the game, along with the bangalore (you know which one) and the golden pathfinder"
"Sometimes you just have to flex for flexing sake, people talking about I CAN GET XYZ GAME FOR THE SAME PRICE, like I’m sorry it’s called DRIP ever heard of it"
Easily one of the best skins in the game
"> Claustic from shadowfall

Claustic is his Christmas skin from Mirage's Holo-days event.

His clown skin is called ""The Last Laugh""."
I'm confused...[teaching is a new skin?!?!
"Rare skin from season 4 free pass, cyber sludge"
Season 4 battle pass skin. It was in the free pass
Yeah bro that exists.
I second that opinion
"It's the system override necromisis skin

You  know what the more I look at it the more it looks like Revenant"
[deleted]
This and Gibby skin are the only skins that were worth the money.
Thats what she said.
Still looks better than half of the normal rare pattern skins
Some skins are limited time like the event skins so they cant be gotten now unfortunately but I guess they might bring some back you never know
We totally need a Maui skin for Gibby.
"This seems to be a bot, way too many comments in different subreddits each"
"I'm just thinking that none of these skins are worth that much money, considering that gems of games like rdr2 and witcher 3 are priced lower than a single 3d model of a br shooter. I think I've spent about 70 euros on this game up to now, which is around the limit for what I should spend on a good game."
I loved the Crypto skin for this event so much that I bought it and I don't even play him. I mostly regret it because he's so hard to play but it was worth it only cause it looks so dang cool.
Pathfinder was pretty good
Pumpkin head bloodhound
"Judge, Jury, Executioner skin for Lifeline would like to be apart of that list."
and Bangalore's Killing Machine
melon Rev? or could you get him for free?
Mirage and Bangalore 2
"Maybe this makes me the bad guy and perpetuating the shitty situation as a whole, but when the events come out I make an attempt to get all the skins not because I like them but because I do have a little extra income due to no kids and decent paying job and I want to support my favorite dev Respawn. Does that make me the bad guy?"
C L O W N C A U S T I C
Oh yeah
You could get it for free if you lucked out on a pack and got the base skin.
Hmmmm. Yes. But that's coming from me
"exactly what i got, lucked out the ugly bird skin since like 1st week of 4th season and now i got Melon"

Great work. I can smell the ink.
"Jesus man, leave some self respect for the rest of us"
beautiful!! reminds me of Bologna
"Ball points are awful, but you made it beautiful, very well done"
Very nice!Looks like it took a long time to do.
amazing! thanks for sharing
Is this Venice by chance? Amazing work!
This photograph is so blue. *zooms in* Oh shit
"This looks absolutely amazing! May I ask what kind of ball point pen did you use? Is it some kind of special one, or regular ball point pen?"
Beaut! Where is this picture of?
That looks so great! How long did it take you?
I love the detail of the lamps and the sense of timelessness they convey. Not to mention the intricate brickwork!
"I wish I could be this good. Well done, buddy. Amazing work"
My hand just got blue by looking this
Jaw-dropping. Love your attention to detail.
Thank you for the new phone wallpaper!
"Outstanding work. Whenever I see posts elsewhere on reddit about people using ball point pens until they run out of ink, I assume they’re doing stuff like this."
This is amazing. What size is the piece
This makes me want to draw again
Wow to do this with just a pen . Just wow . Very impressive.  Great work
"I'm astounded just by how many different angle perspectives you've captured on the those buildings. It's subtle but so many of them are facing juuust slightly a different way. It feels like it pulls you in and plonks you down on the street, which is an amazing feat for ballpoint. Well done!"
My wrist hurts just looking at it. Excellent work!
Some actual fucking art instead of surfing on current socio-political Themes.
How long did this take you to draw?
"I saw the thumbnail and immediately thought, *This could only be Italy.*"
"Great stuff, keep it up! As a personal curiosity I can't help but wonder about the side of your palm, I usually get dirty when writing with a pen and inevitably smudge the paper."
Lovely image.  Random question.   Are you left handed?
"Can I ask, when it came to the stone patterns and other repeating sections, did you copy each stone exactly from a reference or did you eyeball it and draw them without being exact? Really love this."
People who can draw like that are wizards to me. You can't use magic outside of Hogwarst!
this. this is why I don’t think I’m a good artist
Doesn't look anything like a ball point pen this is a street
Thank you haha
"Hahaha, thanks"
When I first looked at this the smell of the ink is what came to my mind aswell.
"Haha, thank you"
Thank you
"I love drawing with pen due to the fact, it's really hard to avoid detail due to the nature of the medium.

This piece is amazing! Makes me want to travel. I don't know where it is, but reminds me of Southern Europe."
It is haha. Thank you
"Yes, they are hard to work with, any suggestions for a good pen etc?"
I don't know the time actually as I'm doing this as a hobby amongst other things. Thank you
Thank you
"It is Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy 
Thank you"
"I'm glad you asked , trust me you don't want to know. I decided to do ball point and that was the only one i had and this pen was of very bad quality and defective to add to it. Sometimes i had to shake to get ink on the paper."
In store only or online as well? Durabiliy?
"Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy"
"I don't know, because it's a hobby, i did this amongst other things. Thank you"
Thank you
"Thank you,"
Thank you
Hahaha
"Hahah thank you i thought i ran out as well, but turns out my pen had problems."
Just a regular A4 printing paper.
Thank you
"Absolutely do it, post it as well for us to see. Good luck"
"Thank you, yes i did"
Thank you
Thank you
"Hahaha, thank you"
"It's a hobby, i did this with other things, so i don't know actually."
What does it look like?
"let me guess, piazza verdi, to via zamboni.. Thank you for reminding me, i had to come back due to covid. can't wait to go back"
"I thought that the whole idea of using a ball point is the fact that it's so pedestrian, and difficult to work with. Are you using ball point because that's all you have or is it a choice?  No disrespect,  the output product is excellent, which is why I ask."
I always use those real cheap bic ones. With the sharp point on the cap. They don’t wiggle as much and have decent extrusion
"I see. I love scribbling around, but never really had any kind of good pen. Right now I'm having a really bad quality pen too, which is almost the same thing you wrote. Gives me hope that even with this pen, it is possible to create such masterpiece."
You did an excellent job on this!
"I normally use gel ink pen or other things, i thought of trying ball point and this was the only one i had which was working at the moment (felt too lazy to go out) and this was a bad pen, i had to shake it frequently and mark and scribble on other papers to get the ink flowing."
"I see, thank you"
Thank you and good luck post it on Reddit too.

The world needs more Sax battle
Straight out of Scott pilgrim
Not rlly a public freakout
Now this is some ancient stuff
Their music sounds like a boss battle
Battle of the saxes
I don't care how many times i see this I never cease to enjoy.
If you like this look up early Moon Hooch. They are the kings of battling saxs.
What song is this
Back in the 1990s i would regularly encounter a homeless guy on the subway who would play the sax for money. Except he didnt actually know how to play it. He would just lay into it as hard as he could and announce that for $5 he would stop playing and move to the next car.
It was my turn to repost this
This is the best anime fight i've seen in the last couple of years
Saxual assault
"WTF makes these people think anyone wants to sit thru their ""performances""?"
JOTARO
Wonder if his instrument aerosolized his spit and endangered passengers. I immediately gave up on the trumpet when the teacher showed me how to use the spit valve by emptying it.
This is the shit i wanna see on here i just want this place to stop posting shit about the protests and start posting fun things that will make us entertained or happy.
It doesn’t. I hate shit like this. Dude I’m riding the subway gtfo with your loud ass music I don’t want to get forced onto me. If I want to hear a saxophone I go to a fucking jazz bar or some shit. You don’t see me djing on my iPad with speakers or whatever would be the techno equivalent. And then they expect to get paid for it. It really grinds my gears.
this is genuinely my favorite video I've ever seen
I fucking love it.
Battle of the saxes.
I want this as my ringtone
This is like the only thing that was good in this subreddit
Finally a worthy opponent..our battle will be legendary!!
Fun stuff

They were so harmonies as well this could be the sound track for a hoss in a multi million production movie or game this shit slaps

"Best thing I've seen this morning, you can't help but smile!"
"I feel like they kinda lost the groove a wee bit towards the end there though, otherwise awesome"
How relaxing
I remember when this happened. Have an upvote.
"Normally train performers make me want to lay on the tracks when they start playing, but this was delightful."
Funk!!!
This is a repost of a repost of a repost! Still makes me smile each time I watch it though :)
This is my favourite yt video of all time.
Lol wtf
This still makes me wanna whip out my tenor...
Its 7.30 in the morning i appreciate seeing this before anything else
"Am I the only one that hates when it happens? Like I’m tryna relax on the subway, I don’t wanna get bombarded with loud music."
In the year 2021 this is how wars will be fought and I love it.
"Hey if anyone else really loves this sound, check out Moon Hooch. They’re incredible and I want to share the joy.....

Didn't know Jake Gyllenhaal could play the sax. Cool.

send them to the riots!!
My cynical mind always resorts to “well this could have just been orchestrated to make it seem spontaneous and get internet points”
Is that the too many zoos guy?
It's really nice to see positive events happening on a subway! When I saw where I was I was worried.
More of this instead of protests please
This got me pretty hype :)
"Apparently it's not annoying to every other person on the train as long as you dance around like a twat and film it. Imagine having a long, hectic, shitty day, just wanting some rest and piece and fucking quiet and then this idiot whips out his trumpet on the train ride home."
Lmao that dude in the beginning that says “ahh shit” like it’s about to be some fight porn
It makes you forget who you aren't.
This repeat never gets old ... pretty cool.
You just got served bro

Can confirm this is true. I was also applauding.
"Swear that was a bit campy, maybe?"
"Surely you have headphones or something similar for those few times that someone plays an instrument on the train. I understand what your saying as I love peace after work also, but at least it breaks up the mundane ride home now and again."
Just because you had a bad day doesn't mean the other people on the train cant have some fun
I made it a point to tip all the musicians preforming when I visited NYC.  All the live free music everywhere was unreal and really uplifting.

Reading that made me physically cringe lol
"That's the key to good improv imo, pull from lots of different songs and play lay a rif or two. Short enough that you're not just playing that song, but long enough for people to realize you're playing a certain song"
In high school band the sax section was directly in front of the trumbones. One ass who sat behind me liked to empty the spit valve on my shoulder. Freaking gross to be playing and suddenly see spit running down your arm. It was good motivation to move up to first chair though.
Nice. Lets get downvoted together.

A bet’s at bet
"I've met people like that (actually, one specific dude comes to mind), he was a metalhead, spent all the day talking about how music was far better in Sweden, Germany, whatever, and all that it comes with their (current) economic stability and whatnot.

One day when confronted with the fact that the nazis would not consider him one of their own and would cast him out (hopefully not just kill him), he said that it was ok, that he would even help them.

So I just don't know what's up with people."

this doesn't look trashy. it seems like she's mocking white power or making fun of it. it's like a jew raising a nazi flag. of course the jew joking
How delusional can you be?
That’s not how this works! That’s not how any of this works!

"I met a South-African man in a chatroom once.
He claimed to be a Nazi and kept trying to persuade me that Aryans ought to rule the world and other races should serve them. He was personally thrilled anout the prospect of serving the Reich. It was too wild to believe but seeing photos like these makes me think."

"Clayton biggsby, is that you?"
"Uncle Ruckus, no relation"
"Maybe she’s taking the Kanye route. He took the confederate flag and put it on his clothes. He did it to take the power of that flag out of racist white peoples hands, and making it his."

"Not sure this Counts, because my first thought was that she was attacked and forcibly tattooed to humiliate her."

"I did a couple of close zooms on my PC just to see the pixels around the tattoo, and I’m pretty sure this fake. 

The black lines around the circle are are very inconsistent. Some are bold, some are thin. Even for a shitty tattoo artist.

My next reason is more of a supportive reason to the first. Coloring in a tattoo isn’t easy, and this look pretty solid compared to their line work. 

When you look at the text, it’s not consistent either. The uppercase letters on the second word are larger than the first. 

It’s just what I’m picking up on. So if anyone disagrees I’m curious to read some answers about this picture."

"Oh okay but we aren't allowed to do black face... Hypocrites

YALL WANNA SEE MY FACE?
Maybe she has the tattoo for the irony?
The fact that she did this has even stripped me even of little hope i had in humanity
Why?
That's gotta be a lost bet.
The funny thing is that she is a black person
Ummm madam ?
Maybe she thinks the tat will protect from the cops
Dude lost a bet.  I hope...
Ironic
"This is being proactively stupid!

Or she is lonely, and wants attention."

It's beautiful when cultures can come together
"Hasn't there been cases where ppl got tattooed or got scars from their enemy? Maybe this is the case here, at least that would make more sense.

Edit: oohh like in orange is the new black when someone tattooed a swastika on Piper...see I knew this was a thing"
He read that tattoo parlours were offering free tattoos to cover hate symbols...
This is like a High Elf Dragonborn siding with the Stormcloaks.

I guess she trans-white.
I don’t understand
Uh...... What the hell????
Aunt Ruckus?
"I have known of one like this. She was one of this super dependent types that gets a new boyfriend, moves way too fast, and scares half of them away and lands the most horrid guys.

She had been married 3 times at 35 and has kids with 5 different men. One of these men was a Nazi, and if he wanted to put a Nazi tattoo on her she would have been 100% down to be supportive of her latest man."
"It’s not even supposed to be black-on-red, it’s supposed to be black-on-white-on-red. If you’re going to be a black white-supremacist, at least get the symbol you’re trying to use right."

"""OK Dude, I'm almost done with your tattoo.  No you can't, I told you that I you can't look at it until I'm done so be patient another minute longer until I'm finished. """
I mean...she having that makes as much sense as white people having that...no freaking sense at all
I choose to believe that this is just god tier trolling.  I imagine a black person sporting that symbol and those words has to piss off at least SOME white supremacists.
"I think this tattoo is ironic, and what I mean by that is that the owner of the tattoo got the ink ironically."
when u take ur meme game to the next level
"the same way as lil huddy identifies as black she identifies as white, any problem with that??"

And they can't really speak up without admitting they're part of a hate group themselves and associate with the Nazi simbol!"
"But not freedom of speech-less!

AMERICA!"
Honestly if your black with a swastika or any type of nazi symbolism or just white supremacy symbolism in general tattooed on your body I’m just going to assume in this day in age it’s for the irony
The black delegation politely decline
Uncle Rukus vibes
"I had a friend. He was born in Korea(Korean blood, yellow skin), lived in Russia, and ended up in Los Angeles. I met him at the rehab in LA. He had a swastika tatted on his chest. When i saw it I asked him about it and he said his friends kinda made him get it. He didn't really care much he was just a druggie. I hope he eventually got rid of it."
"Aunt Ruckus , no relation."
"There was a black Nazi ""skinhead"" in D.C. back in the 80s/90s(skinhead in quotes because skinhead and nazi are contradictory terms). She would fuck up and allegedly sexually assault young skinhead kids at parties and shows. I only visited DC for shows but ran into her a few times...she was a beast. This was pre-internet/before it got big and even up in New England you'd hear about her. This isn't her but these kind of folks do exist in the wild. Her name was Lefty ironically.

Surely this person subscribes to a seriously dark sense of humor.

"I think I'm one of the biggest smartmouths on Reddit and even I couldn't come up with an comment for this one. I'm just...

Huh. Must've lost a bet or something... I hope...
Dumbfuck.
You wouldn't be if a white model had a black power tattoo

"If I see something like that, that’s no longer a tattoo it’s a stab wound"
"Don't want to be the vexillology-nazi here, but it's supposed to be a white circle with a black swastika (on a red flag)."
Next level gen z. Suicidal but want someone else to take care of it.
Is that Candace Owens?
"Uncle ruckus, is that you?"
Oh so that's what they meant by Stockholm Syndrome.
Imagine going to a family reunion with this shit on your shoulder.
It's both okay and funny cause she is black. Deal with it
"Whoa dude, when did you meet Candace Owens?"
Candace Owens +20yrs?
What is this Stockholm syndrome? Down syndrome?
"It's no different from the rest of the black community voting for Democrat mayors, only to have some of the worse crime rates and social issues in America.

Klayton Bigsby.
Clayton Bigsby. A wonderful satire sketch.
They’re just suffering from revitiligo
My name is Clayton and I was in middle school when it came out. I will literally never forget it. I go by Clay now.
Let’s talk about Chinese people
They think they’re the best dancers...
Breathin all the white man's air!
You mean the funniest goddamn skit of any skit show ever? Nah. I can’t recall exactly what you’re talking about.
"When he divorced his wife, priceless."
Show us your face!
First thoughts
It was literally in the first episode of the show. Incredible
Neil Brennan actually discusses the origins of the skit on an episode of the Your Moms House podcast. Chapelle said his grandfather was lighter skinned  and blind. On the day MLK got shot Dave’s grandfather was riding the bus and there were 2 black guys apparently giving a “white guy” a hard time on the bus. He soon realized that the men were yelling at him not knowing he was black.
Absolute gem. Never seen that before.
Literally everyone does
Aww the good ole days.
"Clayton, take off your hood!"
Same shit as white black supremacist
Boondocks as well
Or Uncle Ruckus from Boondocks
Uncle ruckus as well
That was the first episode too. Thats how he debuted his show lol.
I think of Uncle Ruckus from the Boondocks. If you haven't watched it you should. It's such a good show.
Clayton Bigsby
"Naw, thats Auntie Ruckus."
That and stuff like the race draft could never be made today to many whiny bitches.
You all want see my face????!!!!!
"A grey supremacist? Wow,that would be new."
This is the son of Clarence Thomas and Candace Owens
Don't forget Uncle Rukus from The Boondocks

I LOVED that skit. It was clever and funny.
"The guy might be saying that people who are white supremacists are Nazis

"Ever heard of [Patrol 36?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrol_36) They were a Jewish neo-Nazi gang. Made up from Russian Jews emigrated to Israel. Yes, Jewish Russian neo-Nazis in Israel."
What does metal have to do with Nazis?
"You totally reminded me of a dude I went on a one date with. His sister and I were friends, she had told me her ethnicity before which is dad is black and mom is white. Anyway, met her bother a few times, he was cute and asked me out so we went on a date. I remember we were driving to bar and outta no where he started bashing on black people. I didn’t even know what to do, it was terribly awkward, I think I just kept responding “umm ok?”. I told friend what happened, she was just like “yeah, he’s like that, he just hates our dad.”"
Music better in Germany...? Dude the shit my country produces is so fucking trash... Not only music also movies and TV shows... Trust me Germans can't sing or act for shit
There were black nazis in the 30s and 40s. It's the modern neo nazis that hate black people.
Sounds like a metal head elitist who is a little nuts upstairs
"wait till you visit Indonesia, they believed that the Nazi's were the good guy. they even had a Nazi themed cafe but was shutdown due to international backlash"
"> So I just don't know what's up with people.

And it's only going to get worse.

Fuckwits are realising that they have been consigned to the dustheap of history and they're making a last-ditch attempt to seize control."
I gotta agree with him on the metal though.. Northern Europeans know how to fuckin rock.
If you've never seen there is a good early 2000s indie film called *The Believer* that stars Ryan Gosling.  In the film he plays a Jew who is also a neo-Nazi.  It's a very interesting film.
I'm from Georgia originally and know a black guy with a rebel flag tattooed on his throat. Judging by facebook he is not happy with current events.
A simp for Nazis
"People are a weird thing, and only get weirder as life passes on. I don’t think much surprises me now."
Can you say photoshopped?
"Somebunny once told me the world was full of nazis, they ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed."
"Some human trafficers will also tattoo women to demoralize and mark them.

Although this looks better done than those tattoos"
">clearly people don't watch Chappelle's Show heh

Big F in the chat for these poor cunts."
CONNELLINGUS RICE! Sounds like a Mexican dish! Let's put her on a boat to Mexico and let the Mexicans eat her. White power.
My favorite part of that skit is that he divorces his wife because she married a black person.
Chappelle is old and busted. We watch key and Peele now. They're even funnier.
"Might be a surprise, but, that show ended like 15 years ago."
"not a twist, it literally can't be anything else."

"Don't be a menace, classic."

I feel like this counts as a symptom of Stockholm syndrome
I'm going to accept this as the answer and get the heck outta this thread.
Dutch rule of South Africa I.e. apartheid practically was the third reich and they ruled until the early 90’s. Even had evil doctors and were attempting to weaponize an aerosol of ketamine for crowd dirspersal.
Exactly the first thing I thought of too.

That’s Kayla* Bigsby his daughter
He wrote six books
The guy playing the reporter is the anchor of that skit. He's absolutely perfect and never blinks until that guy's head explodes. And he does this moment of shock then pulls it together. His whole narration is pitch perfect like this is a real episode of PBS Frontline.

"""One of the group's members, Ivan Kuzmin, said that in ""Russia they called me Dirty Jew, and here they called me Stinking Russian."" He said that the racism he experienced turned him into a racist.[8]""

Now that is some mental gymnastics"
Were they confused about what nazism is? Or were they mentally unstable? Or did they just follow the culture?
In Soviet Russia...
Ask Varg Vikernes.
"There is a Norwegian subgenre of black metal that is national socialist metal. It's pretty lengthy in that Norwegian black metal artists, not all, but some melted black metal with nazism and it became national socialist black metal originating in Norway. It's a mix of nazism and Satan imagery. Many black metal artists denounce them but there is a culture of nazi metal in Norway regardless if it's small. There is a healthy wiki about it, it was a really weird read."
"I didn't mean it like that, I like metal. It was just for context's sake, since his devotion was born first by admiring black metal bands from Norway, death metal from Sweden, etc, and then he started talking about their superiority at making music. In countries like mine (south american), most local music is mostly meant to be danced to, not complicated, then northern music was ""superior"" etc. Whatever, like I said, just for context, is not something that I directly relate."
"Nothing inherently, but metal is rife with nazis."
"Ive notced *a lot* of desi friends seem to have some ideas like this. One Lankan even got drunk was singing god save the queen, couldnt even sing his own anthem, like damn man"

There's lots of good metal and electronic/industrial/EBM acts.

"What do you mean? Germany produced Bach, Beethoven, AND Nena! Lol"
"Helloween, Grailknights, Accept, Gamma Ray, Blind Guardian, Dionysus, Powerwolf etc etc. I can't speak much for other genres, but OP was talking about metal and Germany has a ton of great metal. Particularly,  a huge number of amazing power metal which usually relies heavily on great vocals.

I can't speak for German made TV or movies, but Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, and Daniel Brühl are all great at what they do."

"Bullshit.

Music is always a question of taste and opinion, there is no objectively better or worse. And to say that a country of over 80 million people only produces ""fucking trash"" when it comes to music, film or TV is completely ridiculous and only shows your own ignorance on the matter. Just because you don't know the good stuff doesn't mean that it doesn't exist."

"In a tattoo artist and though the quality of the photo isn’t the best it looks legitimate. Lines are slightly blown out, the red in the upper left quadrant of the circle is desaturated our has fallout. And the biggest tell is the red it self, on darker skin bright color will take on a slightly darker shade and hue. Sadly, this looks very consistent with what I have seen over the years."
"The part that always got me was the very end of the ""documentary"" where the tv host asks Mr.Biggsby why he left his wife of (40 years?) lol.."
While Key and Peele had their moments. It's no where near as good as The Chappelle Show. Damn near every sketch was hilarious. Charlie Murphy's true Hollywood stories where some of the best comedy sketches of all time.
"I know, right? So sad that when a show ends, all copies of it get burned and it can never be viewed in any form by future generations."

Yes!

"Yeah, the band The 4skins wrote ""ACAB"". Pretty big hit in the Oi!/80s to current skinhead scene.  Great tune. 

[YouTube link to the song](https://youtu.be/i1TAzlmaM-Y)"
What does ACAB stand for?
Well people might think twice if they realized ACAB was also very popular among East European Neo-Nazis …
Maybe they figure if they lick enough boot they'll be spared?
They just see another ethnicity than the germanics/aryans as superior to the rest.
You know hitlers maternal side was Jewish. And that Jewish people follow maternal lineage. Although...he did kill himself...ok valid question.
"Sure but a core part of that ideology is that Slavs and especially Jews are below whoever's holding said ideology. So when the neo-Nazi in question is a Russian Jew then that whole concept becomes even weirder than it was to begin with.

Also these guys were very much aware of their &ndash; let's call it unique &ndash; situation. From the linked wiki article:
>Bonite was once recorded telling a gang member ""my grandfather was a half-Jewboy. I will not have children so that this trash will not be born with even a tiny per cent of Jewboy blood."""
"Shit wasn't he the dude who cracked someone's head open and drank from it?

Ok than say that till Schweiger for example has expressions... He doesn't he always looks like he is taking a massive shit. That's what you call a good actor?? Rly???
He probably thought that the small number of black soldiers fighting for the Third Reich were allowed to be part of the nazi party.

Afraid so. I think you're suffering from the fact that far too many Americans would say that in all seriousness. Take my apology at least for misunderstanding.
What'd it say?
"Define what ""not ok"" means.   I mean if I say it's trashy it means that the person should be judged for it meaning it's ""not ok"" right?   I'm just saying there's a good chance there's a different story behind this other than her being a white supremacist."

"I think Nazis are racist, but just because someone would've introduced this into a gamble doesn't mean they are a nazi. It could just mean they really know how to up the stakes."
In the hypothetical situation of a group of people betting with the loser getting a nazi tattoo how do you know anyone there is racist? Surely you understand that you're not omniscient or capable of reading the minds of hypothetical people.
We're they suicidal?
All Cops Are Bastards
My Mexican immigrant neighbor loves Trump and hates other Mexicans because he thinks he is better than everyone else.  And I guess he is crazy enough to believe that the racist will just acknowledge how superior he is and let him live because obviously he is better than those OTHER Mexicans.
"Just a plain old stabbing, IIRC."
He was the dude who killed a bandmate because he said that guy was going to make a snuff film out of him.
"He killed a man, but I never heard anything like that."

That’s got to be it right? Like years of hierarchical imperialist structure fucked him in the head?
"I mean.. okay the dance/pop and hard rock areas are pretty embarrassing, but at a minimum you've got not only Rammstein but also The Notwist.

Rammstein is insanely good though. No other country has anything that resembles rammstein's impact on its genre.

"> till Schweiger [...]

>That's what you call a good actor?? Rly???

Nope, I didn't say anything close to that. But by the same logic the US doesn't have good actors because of Steven Seagal. Do you see the fallacy here?"
That tattoo looks anything but spensive
"I'd venture that it is because a large portion of WP/Nazi tats are done in prison, and this was clearly done by someone with experience and proper equipment."
"> The N-Word family is god damn hilarious too

oh YEAH! the milkman skit LOL. ""You crazy N....AS!"""
That's the most confusing thing I've seen and heard today. Context??
Indeed it was. Bernie could barely put a foot wrong when it came to movie roles. His role as Jangle Leg in 'Life' is also an underrated masterclass. Even when he's not on screen he can be heard mumbling and muttering off screen. Is miss Bernie Mac....
"Ur good, rug man."
In reality I'm just jealous AF. As a white guy I'd love to ironically give a public nazi salute without being stoned off all public spaces
All that *Ching Chang Chong!!!!* I cant understand *you*!
“Because she was a ******-lover.”
*head explodes*
"What gamble? Why do you assume she tattooed this because she lost a bet? Also, no rational, non-nazi person would ever tattoo that on themselves just because they lost a bet, lets not kid ourselves. 

And, even if she had been forced to do it under the threat of being killed or something, she could have still have it painted over and change it into something else afterwards. She clearly wanted it there, that woman is a nazi."
There's no way around it. If u make someone get a Nazi symbol tattoo u might not be a Nazi but u must be racist.
Because getting a Nazi swastika tattoo isn't funny in any way. Combined w the white power underneath? If they made her do it theyre proly not her friends... Or they're all very brainless

"That's kind of sad. I used to think like that when I was younger, at like 14. I'm a Muslim. I think it's because of YouTubers like Blaire White and Hunter Avallone. They made me hate myself so much haha."

"That's pretty fucked up.  Like where does that motivation come from?  You honestly have that hard of a time being told you can't do something?  You really missing out by not being able to raise your arm a certain angle in public?  It feels like raising your arm up in a classroom, except at an angle.  I'd bet you have enough of an imagination to conjure up the sensation in your mind.  You know what, you can even do it in the privacy of your own home.  Oh wait, but you need that public space don't you.  You need to get a reaction from people.  That's what this is about.  You're just like a little kid acting out because they're not getting enough attention from Mommy."
Look up the word hypothetical.
I think you just have a lack of imagination because I literally just described a scenario where no one is racist. The most you can say with the hypothetical information provided is that they're racially insensitive or apathetic.
"It's not funny to you, and it's definitely in poor taste. You can say it's brainless, you can say that the other gamblers are assholes, but you can't say their motivation was a hatred for other races until they do something actually discriminatory. You also can't say they weren't her friends, but it's safe to assume that if they are people she considers friends then she probably needs new friends at least."
"That was Euronymous, yes
The whole Scandinavian metal scene story is quite disturbing but interesting nonetheless."
"You seem like a jolly guy, why don't you join our discussion?"

Condolezza Rice?  Sounds like a mexican dish

"Ah yes, 'racially insensitive'"
A symbol that has the death of millions of people shouldn't be funny to anyone.
I'm not the biggest expert on white supremacy since I'm not from the West but I do enjoy some heated reddit debates lol
I'd just take your picture and move along to post in a few places.   Nothing to lose my shit over. Just someone to pity.
"""Maybe we should send her down to mexico, so all the mexicans can eat her. White power""!"
"I was following along the lines of the gambling hypothetical, no one actually knows anything. Surely you don't actually understand the word hypothetical if you have to specify that I don't know something. That's the point of a hypothetical situation."
"Lol, I don't know how to explain this besides saying there's a difference something that's a moral imperative and a moral virtuous action. That's not a direct analogue, but the nuance is pretty similar. I'm on your side that it's uncool, but racism is more than just a symbol."
Don't stop. I really enjoy WFH :(
"Yeah it's not really as heated or meaningfull as I'd like, people prefer to just down vote but it's up to them"
Thanks for proving my point. You would get a reaction and go cry on twitter
I'd look up the difference between mocking someone and crying over someone.  Your inability to imagine the varying possible reasons for action may suggest some retardation or learning disability.

Satan likes Latin because it’s a pain to learn. I know this because I failed out of a middle school Latin class in the middle of the first semester.
"They use Latin because Latin is historically associated with Catholicism, both in movies and IRL most satanic cults are a sort of mockery of Traditional Catholicism with “black masses”, chanting, candles and everything. 

But I’m not a satanist, so I’m sure someone else could tell you more even though I wouldn’t encourage you to go in that direction. Though as the largest and arguably the oldest Christian group it seems to be a no-brainer that Satanists would specifically choose Catholicism to invert/mock."
"He should have the writing in ancient chinese there are so many different characters, and most people joining would have no experience with it, that would be truly satanic."
"There's many forms that use Enochian, such as LaVeyan Satanism."
most folk are just LARPing as doctor faustus
"The devil character was invented by Latin-speaking Roman Christians. 

Satan was a character in the Hebrew Book of Job, but he wasn’t then the devil. He was actually more like God’s lawyer."
All the contracts are in Latin so no one understands that they are selling their soul.
Reddit's been pretty shit today but this was pretty frigus
Realistically he would probably speak the first language from before the Tower of Babbel if you believe in that.
I mean to be fair the Catholic Church insisted on Latin services for the longest time
The same for exorcisms. Spiritual beings older than time magically give a fuck because your evolved ape throat made some sounds.
If you'd see my high school latin teacher you would know that satan loves latin
"The reason so many things were in Latin in general is that it's an pretty unambiguous language.

What if I say ""Bill and I will buy a lottery ticket, while You and Sarah will buy a lottery ticket. If Bill and I win, **we** will share the winnings. If your and Sarah win, *we* will share the winnings.""

In this case, *we* means all four of us. But what about **we**? Maybe it means me and Bill, maybe it means me and you, or me and Sarah, or me and Sarah and Bill, or me and Sarah and you, or just all four of us. There's no way to actually specify what I actually mean by ""we"", because of you think about it, in each case the statement is exactly the same. 

Latin does have ambiguities, but no where near as many as many other contemporary languages."
Common enough language people in a European context will feel they can translate/understand the bargain but a dead language so the only one with knowledge of idiom and contextual interpretation to really understand it is the immortal demon lawyer who wrote the thing? Sounds about right.
You need to learn Hebrew to talk to satan
what if satan contacted with early mean and taught them latin?
How is this suspiciously specific?
"And how important Christianity is to exorcism. Like, an eternal demon is supposed to know about or care about some Jewish carpenter lol"
Like how most Christians think God spoke in Old English. But specifically the kind King James used.
Cuz zis is the language of GODS
