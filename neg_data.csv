I'll be honestly shocked if we dont see an announcement for Skyrim: 10-year anniversary edition coming November 2021
"Well I guess I have to be the asshole here....  


why the fuck are you all crying when we all know you're still going to buy the game?  


And Rockstar knows it. That's why they don't care and do whatever they want to get your money anyway..."
"Shut up and buy skyrim again. Shit wrong game, shut up and buy GTA V again"
"I stopped playing gta online in 2017 
Just got so mundane and the grind is the worse I’ve encountered in a video game"
I’m so fucking tired of getting in game advertisements from Lester and random bots trying to get me to buy things with in game currency which in turn you need to pay cash for. Since I have $60k in game I can’t buy a fucking bunker STOP ADVERTISING IN A GAME WE PAID MONEY FOR!!
Dwayne Johnson was behind the camera. Nevermind.
People have to be getting sick of GTA 5.
"We won’t get another gta game in long time thanks to all these kids still giving them so much money, gta online is one of the worst games i’ve played idk how people still play that boring ass shit"
Who said we're getting tired of this? People still ~~actively eat up Rockstars bullshit~~ showing interest in the game.
Why do you think I stopped playing these games?  These are cash-grab MTX games wrapped up as a real game.
Aaah yes I also hate all the microtransactions in Skyrim
Fuck stretch
"Worst place in the world, **GTA Online**"
I'd not be so angry if they remastered Morrowind or Oblivion (just graphically and adding some QoL stuff and fixing some things) but yeah I'd expect Todd to pull another Skyrim out of his bum.
i mean if you look for?
The heists in multiplayer aren't bad they are just behind hundred hour grind walls or $40. Art why narrative are dead when micro transactions are printing money.
"Also the already “revealed” the next elder scrolls, so that example is just all around bad"
You mean GTAO2?
Just update GTA V's engine and add map expansion. I would really hate for them to pull a GTA III-VC-SA-IV and change physics wildly again.
">I am probably gonna buy the game again

And that is why it is getting released again."
That’s what happens when game companies treat the players like ATM machines.
He also had the least yee-yee ass haircut in the game.
That’s what drives me insane. I’m never going to grind. I’m never going to spend money for these vehicles. I want to try them in single player. Guess I’m fucked!
I used to base all my game buying decisions on demo disks.
The worst part is the online got rid of a lot of the features that single player had.
Which is sad because Undead Nightmare for RDR1 was a masterpiece of DLC.
Getting on GTAO was so disappointed.  The economy is bloated to hell and the gameplay is so gimmicky.  Call me boring but I just wanted to do heists in multiplayer.  Thats it.  Heists set up by an effective matchmaking system.  Nope.
I played for like 2 hours and l was so disgusted l didn't touch RDR2 again for a whole year.
"For me unfortunately online always crashed for years without any error, so I kinda have up on it."
I just picked up a refurbished HP omen with a 2080 to replace my gtx 860 powered laptop. And all the games are console ports and thus tend to have been pre dumbed down graphically. Cue sad face.
"Just a tip, I assume you didn't mean to do ^this and instead meant to do \^this. 

You have to type a \ before the \^, otherwise ^ puts the text after it in ^superscript."
Disgusted? By what?
reinstall or verify game cache maybe? that sucks dude
The horrific pricing of everything at launch. Idk if it's gotten any better. I stopped playing it after a day or so because it was essentially impossible to do anything without buying gold or whatever. It was also glitchy as hell and I specifically remember this one mission that kept eating my horse stamina over and over making me feed the horse everything I owned. Said fuck it then and there.

"u mean hands up?   
NO! you dirty minded individual! i didnt mean that! ... theres guy pointing gun at you! thats why u should put your hand up ..."
Ah Dragon Con....too bad it probably will be cancelled this year.
This is a fucking cosplay of what?
Sorry I don't get it
My god that is disturbing yeeeesh
sad there's no dragoncon this year
Creepy ahahah
His genius is almost frightening.
It's fucking creepy
Sad this will be my first in 8 years not going to Dragoncon... :(
"Not being negative, but wouldn't he get shot if cops saw him with that gun? And I know it's fake"
Too bad TJ Miller ruined his career shortly afterwards.
Now get the fuck outta heyeah
He always gave me bad vibes. My favourite scene in Transformers (2014) was >!when his character died!<
"Why do I remember it different?
Thought he tells Sugarbear just to walk away instead of losing the arm :("
What’s wrong with Deadpool’s legs?
"Definitely! We've gone every year since 2010ish, so it's going to be tough missing out this year. Next year will be insane."
Not just called in a fake bomb threat but did it because a woman refused his advances.
"If you go into a transformers movie looking for a story, you're gonna have a bad time"
Having no arms doesn't excuse terrible penmanship. It explains it.
He lost them... in a poker game. Wolvy had aces and 8s.
"I talked to a talent agent and he said TJ was like Eric Bachman, but worse."
"Sounds like he has substantial mental issues.

What a terrible human being."
I came to the comments for an explanation but am still confused. Which is it?
"""You just brought shit to a piss fight, you little cunt. Now you get in your fucking house and you get me five Adderall, or I'll slit your fucking throat, you understand? I'll kill your mother. I'll rape your father. I'll curbstomp that little face SO HARD that your teeth will go **FLYING,** you little shit. Now gogogogogo, get me five Adderall, NOW."""
You're either painfully ignorant or purposefully obtuse.
"Because? 

Dumb question, dumb answer..."

Did it reveal a secret?
Yet nobody wants to align with my knob:'(
"Seeing this lowkey makes me want colour coded burners and knobs, because half the time I turn on the wrong one."
My initial thoughts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93lrosBEW-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93lrosBEW-Q)
How crazy is that
Her gas tank is that bad
Bro what the fuck I'm not used to reddit comments
"It’s very subtle product marketing, I don’t know how or why, but I like it."
Now I’m irrationally annoyed that the burners aren’t color-coded to match their knobs
Take my upvote and fuck off
Did you mean dear boy?
You're telling me we can find gold nuggets behind your knob?
"He has ovenfans you can subscribe to.

Sorry, worst one yet."
"Nah she’s a vertical hit, not a top job!"
Um what? I thought you where pointing out how the photo might be faked so I was agreeing with you? I must be stupid because to me that doesn’t look like a joke and I was just agreeing with you
"That's *exactly* as creepy as I'd expect from someone called ""Corpse-Fucker""..."

I don't see anything wrong with this.
That's a sad looking Christmas tree...
"It's absurd, but I can dig it."
Nobody going to mention the horrible glare it will have from that lamp??!?!
That is both wrong and a thing of beauty.
"If it’s stupid but works, is it stupid?"
Nothing wrong with recycling....
Who knows maybe she secretly plays nes on there
Yup I have one as an end table. Bitch has wheels built in and is almost impossible to move.
"Plus, turn it on and playing on the screen with a magnet makes a hell of a game"
I used to hate those cabinets. Now I really dig them.
Antiques was my hobby. Both will be worthless.
NAL but why would the context of volunteering vs being paid for labor have anything to do with liability for damage to property?  Seems irrelevant.

What the fuck did i just watch..?
"God dammit, I just lost the game..."
I swear there's a song in there from Conkers bad fur day
This is really disturbing
"Harold rescued my two kids from a burning building once. 

And then he murdered one of them in cold blood in front of me. ""All debts must be paid"" he said ""one life for one death""."
That’s pretty pathetic.
"Dammit! Thanks a lot, I hate this stupid game."
Fuck you! You will never take Transylvania from Romania! It's ours you losers!
"It's been approximately 6 months.. and today, I too, lost the game."
Seriously .....? We should have this in our country....i mean this cracked me up..

"And then they proceeded to have a total monopoly on gum. Seriously, name a brand of stand-alone gum products, I bet you Wrigley’s owns it. Extra, 5, even Eclipse mints if my memory serves me well! It’s insane."
Beau Wrigley bought my friend's marajuana company. He's getting into the weed game. Well he's gotten into it. The amount of money my friend got was ridiculous.
They need to bring back stick gum. I miss it badly
"They then began including stale bread as a gift with the gum, because they were fucking sick of switching products"

California is an insane state.
Well yeah when you tax the living fuck out of everyone and everything it's hard not to be the richest state.
"I thought you were making a joke and clicked the link expecting to be brought to a YouTube video of a clip from Total Recall, I was majorly disappointed."
how is income inequality in California and where does it rank on GINI coefficient?
What do you mean?
Hollywood accounts for a very small fraction of California’s GDP
do you mean median? because mode would probably be 0 depending who you include in the figure
It’s dumb to compare a city to a state. Idk why DC is even on lists like this.
"California also has the highest population in the U.S., so this visualization is probably very similar, if not identical, to a visualization on the population density of the country.

I'm not saying that it's a bad representation or anything, just expressing my interest in seeing how per capita would change things."
Jesus. I'm not even to the mean per capita GDP of DC.
What do you mean? I didn't make any fancy things...
"The amount of people in this thread that don't know the difference between median, mean, and mode is downright embarrassing."

That's a fucking heat exchanger.
The onion layers of fake news here is insane.
"Ya'll remember when DR.doofenshmirtz built his ""Anator"" and lost to a baking soda volcano. yea science fairs are weird."
You mean the boy who made a clock to look like a bomb after being told to not do it
"But he is brown, though. She’s not. See? Not that complicated."
"Fuck it, the world is ending this week anyways."
"By ""making"" you mean he deconstructed an alarm clock and glued it to a pencil case."
It's fake news...
This is like Reed Richards making a fucking teleportation device when he was like 9 in Fant4stic
Science fairs are not fair
This is not fair
"how the fuck did she get uranium-235

HOW?!"
This girl wouldn’t have access to basically anything needed to build an atomic bomb. She probably made a fake one and a diorama explaining how an atomic bomb works.
"I saw some video about a kid who made a nuclear  reactor in his backyard. He got heaps of smoke detectors which had small amount of uranium in them

"Shh, you'll motivate illegal nuke production. Like the information, though!"
"Enriching uranium is difficult, but the building of the device itself still requires fidelity and precision that a lone highschooler could almost certainly not pull off"
Yep! Completely ordinary for a school science project!
This is why fireflies are going extinct
A miserable pile of secrets.
Well it is fake .
Are you really so dumb to not realize that this is fake and that she did not in fact build a nuclear bomb?
"I just read this and what the fuck.

She thinks that nuclear weapons aren't dangerous? Russians, North Koreans, etc. have that powerfull nuclear weapons that they can just delete her city/village and other around it and there's nothing to be afraid of? She's just complete idiot to say this."
"Thanks for the correction, I hate being incorrect"
those poor cpus

I don’t think so. I think it was fucking the clone that’s considered abuse.

You mean https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hahn ? The Nuclear Boy Scout.
"You know why i got gold ... Before summoning the dark abbot , satan himself ,  i took that fucking atomic bomb and threw that at some island"
Why would you hope that the boy killed himself? That's fucked up.

"Soldiers from the south have often been seen donning the confederate flag.  So what Theyre dog whistling to our country’s enemies that they hate black people? Come on bro. I don’t know how , like I wouldn’t have anything to do with that flag ....but it’s obviously patriotic to them somehow."
I mean they buy her racist flags
Fucking ISIS lasted longer...
"Wrong. It was the Virginian battle flag, not the flag of the confederacy"
"It would require a constitutional amendment. Our rights to freedom of expression are very broad, and hate speech is considered protected unless it also falls under a category of unprotected speech, like incitement to violence."

I quit facebook coz i was sick of people being racist. So now my dads started messaging me racist memes. Wtf ?!
The reason for it is they dont see it inappropriate. Posting how you hate this particular group of people in their eyes is them pointing out a problem that isnt being taken care of.
What is insane about this?
"Social media is the flypaper for stupid people. Folks will post all kinds crazy stuff and then get upset when it is found and they face the consequences. A local police chief posted some racist stuff about protesters, it was found by the media and now he’s begging for forgiveness."

Obama had it pretty bad to with all the racial hate
"Trump hasn't been treated badly.. he just thinks being held accountable and being required to answer questions (which every politician has to do) is a witch hunt. if you say anything to him that isn't praise, he thinks you are mistreating him. so pathetic. he's the biggest snowflake in the world."
"I don't know Trump, maybe because you're... *bad?*"
"Poor donald. What a stupid guy.
He is acting like a kid"
Orange man bad. Have you heard that orange man bad? Let me tell you about why orange man bad.
He's the worst treated president since the last president. Just ask ~~Chief Justice~~ Merrick Garland.
"Also, how the fuck are Democrats supposed to ""get anything done"" when literally every bill they pass lands in Mitch's legislative graveyard?"
"The baby snowflake is crying again, fucking pathetic loser"
UK here so not really up on US politics before Jan 2017. What was so bad about Hillary?
"Jeff Tiedrich is mentally ill, he says so much weird shit to Trump all day it’s a lot of damage!"
There is that word again. Hate. Its always hate with these guys.
"Well, he is arguably the worst president in the history of the U.S. and a serious contender for garbage fire of the century, beating out actual garbage being literally on fire. So what did he expect?"
"Now correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t there a president who got shot, they tried to pull the bullet out but couldn’t, then he died of an infection?"
The 112th congress was prettttty bad no?
That was lightening transition from “I’m serious.
"There has been no President of our Country that has treated the citizens as badly as I have. The people are frozen with hatred and fear. We get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen by any President. There is no Witch Hunt !

FTFY."
You’re not like any other president. You’re a fucking clown
"Well if jfk didnt fuck up his cia wars, and the bay of pigs invasion then we wouldnt have had to assassinate him."
"And Clinton was impeached by the Republicans for lying about banging an intern. And W was mercilessly roasted as an idiot and a war criminal by the Democrats and the media.


‘Member when mispronouncing “nuclear” and using words like “strategery” were the dumbest things a president could say? And things like cheating on your wife were considered a terrible stain on the office of the presidency? Ah, we were such sweet summer children."
But but racial hate and racism is a myth.
Did he have a lot of racial hate? I think people just didn't like what he was doing.
"You seriously think that getting critisism, any amount of it, is worse than  getting killed?"
"We all know, but it really does need to be pointed out ad infinitum; Donald Trump is a world class narcissistic moron who has no place being in charge of anything, let alone a world power with nuclear weapons."

"*man kills someone*

No he didn't. You are just mad as a box of twats."
"If a terrible person finds a religion, and it stops them from doing horrible things, isn't that basically going to therapist?

I mean yea the underlying guy is a bitch, but if he's not doing anything, it seems that he found the anchor he needs"
I’m sorry you went through what you went through with your mother. Whether you like it or not religion did stop alot of people from doing horrible things because that’s just how their brain works. Not everyone is like you and not everyone has that moral code that you have and that’s horrible but that’s how it is and that’s why (among other reasons) there is religion in the first place.
"Had a boss like that once , he said religion is the only thing that stops him from being a horrible person and the promise of going to heaven. Real fucked up thing to say"
Religion is inherently designed to control populations of people. Not only to keep them from doing horrible things (2000 years ago) but to subjugate them. Now it just seems to be a cause for wars and hate. The threat of pain or pleasure eternally later shouldn’t be needed to keep a person from doing evil now. Our life isn’t a test.
At least they're trying to stop being a horrible person
"I have never heard anybody say that religion stops you from doing horrible things.

So, I’m gonna say this is not an unpopular opinion. It’s just you going off about religion."
This sub is so bad
Fucking bang on mate
If they're not doing terrible things... They're not terrible. A lot of people don't do terrible shit fearing jail. Same thing. Alot of people need something to hold them back til anger goes away and realization of stupidity happens.
"Imo i think this is stupid.Im semi-religious,but ive always lived with the belief that i shouldnt do horrible things unless provoked."
Or using religion to excuse being a horrible person
"It doesn't matter what stops you from being a horrible person, if you don't do horrible things then you are not a terrible person."
I don’t think this is unpopular. It’s literally “if religion bad don’t be bad”
The strangest part of this is that you put killing people next to robbing banks as awful things. Do you feel those are really bad?
Horrible Person
"The terrible thing in that scenario is that your mother told you those things, I'm assuming to scare you. If someone has an urge to do something, but refrains on the grounds of religion, who's to say they are bad. People who follow through with urges that will hurt others are terrible people"
I don't know a single person who operates this way. This is not an unpopular opinion but a stupid one imho.
Horrible + horrible = terrible
Some people just use religion to justify being horrible people.
"The unfortunate reality is that the world is packed full of horrible, piece of shit people and their dogma is the only thing keeping them from doing horrible things.  It ends up being a good thing in a terrible way."
Without religion? I’d probably be that dude from Mad Max who wore an entire fridge.
"I agree, I am a terrible person but glad I got religion to keep me away from hurting people and myself.

It sounds douchy but there was nothing I could you after years of abuse that damaged my senses, and as a broke student who cant afford therapy, religion was number one thing that stopped me from being a terrible person.

I'm terrible but religion helps me fight it."
If they're not doing those horrible things then how are they are a terrible person. If they found restraint in religion then good for them.
"If you don’t commit crime only because you are afraid of getting caught and going to jail, then you are a bad person."
Now - don't you appreciate the fact that there's such thing as religion that shields you from all these horrible people?
"My mom used to be a horrible person, but after going to vihara, she changed a lot and learned that what she used to do were wrong. Even though I am not religious, I am still thankful that it helped change my mom to who she is today. I personally disagree and that it is “you were” a terrible person, as maybe they meant that thanks to god they learned that it was wrong and will now stop doing it, so even if religion somehow disappears, they wouldn’t do it again because they learned it was a wrong thing to do."
"So religion stops people from doing bad things, isn't that what you are saying?"
It’s not wrong for horrible people to try and improve is it?
"If it weren't for god I would've killed myself long ago, im a terrible person for clinging on to the only entity that won't betray or disappoint me"
Usually it's religion that makes people do horrible things in the first place.
"If you need the law to not be a horrible person, you are a horrible person."
It’s very sad that people are assuming all religious people are like that because there are people that are using religion as an excuse to do bad things. I’m a Christian and there are tons of crazy Christians that ruin it for other people who try to find God or whatever religion it is.
"Which is funny because ""don't use the lords name in vain"" doesnt mean dont say ""oh my god!"" It means don't do horrible shit in gods name"
I don't think God cares if you sweare. It's literally just angry words
"The underlying question is how do you define ""bad"" when talking about bad things"
"Yeah, religion bad, it has to hit frontpage at least 1/week."
"The fact of the matter is that all parts of human history are bloody, unfair, cruel, etc. Humans just are those things, not exclusively ofc but we all have some ancestor that killed, raped, etc. Humans just are those things, not exclusively ofc but we all have some ancestor that killed, raped, etc."
